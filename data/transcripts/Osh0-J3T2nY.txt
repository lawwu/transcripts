[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   There is a famous story about Einstein
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.840]   that he used to go think, think, think,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.280]   and then go for a walk,
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.040]   and he would whistle sometimes.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.880]   So I remember the first time I heard this story,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.120]   I thought, "Hmm, how interesting.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.960]   "So what a coincidence that this came to him
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.440]   "when he was whistling."
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.360]   But in fact, it's not.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.040]   This is how it works, in some sense,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.820]   that you have to prepare for it,
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.440]   but then it happens when you stop thinking, actually.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.840]   So the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.840]   and you kind of almost become that truth
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.800]   that you're seeking.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.120]   - The following is a conversation with Edward Frenkel,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.600]   one of the greatest living mathematicians,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.400]   doing research on the interface of mathematics
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.620]   and quantum physics,
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.320]   with an emphasis on the Langlands program,
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.520]   which he describes as a grand unified theory of mathematics.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.640]   He also is the author of "Love and Math,
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.280]   "the Heart of Hidden Reality."
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.240]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.080]   To support it,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.440]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.060]   And now, dear friends, here's Edward Frenkel.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.040]   You open your book, "Love and Math," with a question,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280]   how does one become a mathematician?
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.240]   There are many ways that this can happen.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.300]   Let me tell you how it happened to me.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.440]   So how did it happen to you?
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.220]   - So first of all, I grew up in the Soviet Union,
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.300]   in a small town near Moscow called Kolomna.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.280]   And I was a smart kid, you know, in school,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.760]   but mathematics was probably my least favorite subject.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.000]   Not because I couldn't do it.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.960]   I was a straight A student
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.800]   and I could do all the problems easily,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.840]   but I thought it was incredibly boring.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.480]   And since the only math I knew
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.920]   was what was presented at school,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.420]   I thought that was it.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.540]   And I was like, what kind of boring subject is this?
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.300]   So what I really liked was physics,
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.820]   and especially quantum physics.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.840]   So I was buying,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.620]   I would go to a bookstore and buy popular books
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.620]   about elementary particles and atoms and things like that,
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.820]   and read them, you know, devour them.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.640]   And so I thought,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940]   my dream was to become a theoretical physicist
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.560]   and to delve into this finer structure of the universe.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.180]   So then something happened when I was 15 years old.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.160]   It turns out that a friend of my parents
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.760]   was a mathematician who was a professor at the local college.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.520]   It was a small college preparing educators and teachers.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.560]   It's a provincial town.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000]   Imagine it's like 117 kilometers from Moscow,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.500]   which would be something like 70 miles, I guess.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.340]   You do the math. (laughs)
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.140]   - I like how you remember the number exactly.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.080]   - Yeah, isn't it funny how we remember numbers?
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.120]   So his name was Yevgeny Yevgenyevich Petrov.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.740]   And if this doesn't remind you
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.700]   of the great works of Russian literature,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.060]   then you haven't read them. (laughs)
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.660]   Like "War and Peace," you know,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.060]   with the patronymic names.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.860]   But this was all real, this was all happening.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.040]   So my mom one day by chance met Yevgeny Yevgenyevich
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.760]   and told him about me, that I was a bright kid
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.240]   and interested in physics.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.260]   And he said, "Oh, I wanna meet him.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.280]   "I'm going to convert him into math."
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.320]   And my mom's like, "Nah, math, he doesn't like mathematics."
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.760]   So I was like, "Okay, let's see what I can do."
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.940]   So I went to see him, so I'm about 15.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.640]   And a bit arrogant, I would say.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.740]   You know, like average teenager.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.640]   So he says to me, "So I hear that you are
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.040]   "interested in physics and elementary particles."
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.000]   I was like, "Yeah, sure."
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   And he said, "For example, do you know about quarks?"
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.740]   And I said, "Yes, of course I know about quarks.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.740]   "Quarks are the constituents of particles
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.640]   "like protons and neutrons."
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.600]   And it was one of the greatest discoveries
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.240]   in theoretical physics in the '60s
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.720]   that those particles were not elementary,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.680]   but in fact had the smaller parts.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.280]   And he said, "Oh, so then you probably know
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.800]   "representation theory of the group SU(3)."
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.120]   (laughing)
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.440]   I'm like, "SU what?"
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.440]   So in fact, I wanted to know what were the underpinnings
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.880]   of those theories.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.680]   I knew the story, I knew the narrative,
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.920]   I knew kind of the basic story
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.580]   of what these particles looked like.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.320]   But how did physicists come up with these ideas?
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.920]   How were they able to theorize them?
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.160]   And so I remembered, like it was yesterday,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   so he pulls out a book, and it's kind of like a Bible,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.760]   like a substantial book, and he opens it
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.680]   somewhere in the middle.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.480]   And there I see the diagrams that I saw in popular books,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.520]   but in popular books, there was no explanation.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.800]   And now I see all these weird symbols and equations.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.460]   It's clear that it is explained in there.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.300]   Oh my God.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.260]   He said, "You think what they teach you at school
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.180]   "is mathematics?"
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.620]   It's like, "No, this is real mathematics."
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.220]   So I was instantly converted.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.940]   - That to understand the underpinnings of physical reality,
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.860]   you have to understand what SU(3) is.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.860]   - You have to learn what are groups, what is group SU(3),
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.660]   what are representations of SU(3).
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.560]   There was a coherent and beautiful,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.840]   I could appreciate the beauty,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.760]   even though I could not understand heads and tails of it.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.920]   - But you were drawn to the methodology,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.600]   the machinery of how such understanding could be attained.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.000]   - Well, in retrospect, I think what I was really craving
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.260]   was a deeper understanding.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.200]   And up to that point, the deepest that I could see
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.920]   were those diagrams, but for that story
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.780]   that a proton consists of three quarks
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.500]   and a neutron consists of three quarks
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.100]   and they're called up and down and so on.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.460]   But I didn't know that there was actually underneath,
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.900]   beneath the surface, there was this mathematical theory.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.340]   - If you can just link around it,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.560]   what drew you to quantum mechanics?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.020]   Is there some romantic notion of understanding the universe?
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.300]   What is interesting to you?
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.420]   Is it the puzzle of it
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.220]   or is it the philosophical thing?
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.600]   - Now I am looking back.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   So whatever I say about Edward at 15,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.960]   he's colored by all my experiences that happen
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.580]   in the meantime, my current views and so on.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.400]   - For the people who may not know you,
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.000]   I think your book and your presentations
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.720]   kind of revealed that that 15-year-old
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.880]   is still in there somewhere.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   - Well, I take it as a compliment.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.160]   - Some of the joy.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.920]   - He's probably still here now, yes.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.360]   In some way.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.980]   - Yeah, I think it was a joy of discovery
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.640]   and the joy of going deeper into the kind of the,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.340]   to the root, to the deepest structures of the universe,
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.480]   the secrets, the secrets.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.140]   And we may not discover all of them,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.620]   we may not be able to understand,
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.980]   but we're going to try and go as far and as deep as we can.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.540]   I think that's what was the motivating factor in this.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.480]   - Yeah, there's this mystery, there's this dark room,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.680]   and there's a few of these mathematical physicists
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   that are able to shine a flashlight briefly into there.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.480]   We'll talk about it, but it also kind of makes me sad
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.000]   that there's so few of your kind
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   that have the flashlight to look into the room.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.900]   It's interesting.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.740]   - I don't think there are so few, to be honest,
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.660]   because I think, I find a lot of people
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.560]   are actually interested.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.220]   If you talk to people, you know,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.100]   like some people you wouldn't expect
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.460]   to be interested in this,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.620]   from all walks of life,
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.620]   from people of all kinds of professions.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.880]   I tell them I'm a mathematician,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.920]   and they, "Mathematician, okay, so that's a separate story."
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.060]   A lot of people, I think, have been traumatized
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.260]   by their experience in the math classes.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.100]   We can talk about it later.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.100]   But then they ask me what kind of research I do,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.380]   and I mentioned that I work on the interface
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.580]   of math and quantum physics,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.660]   and their eyes light up.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.860]   It's like, "Oh, quantum physics,"
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.300]   or like Einstein's relativity,
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.540]   or I'm really curious about it.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.820]   I watch this podcast, or I watch that podcast,
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.140]   you know, and I've learned this.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.940]   It's like, "What do you think about that?"
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.660]   So I actually find that actually physicists
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.660]   are doing a great job educating the public, so to speak,
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.660]   in terms of popular books and videos and so on.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.620]   Mathematicians are behind.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.620]   We're starting to catch up a little bit,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.380]   have been starting last 10 years,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.780]   but we are still behind.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.660]   But I think people are curious.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.980]   Science is still very much something
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.340]   that people want to learn,
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.140]   because that's our kind of, the best way we know
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.800]   to establish some sort of objective reality,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.340]   whatever that might be.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.300]   - Yeah, to figure out this whole puzzle,
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.140]   to figure out the secrets that the universe holds.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.300]   - Things that we can agree on, kind of, you know?
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.220]   Even though, for me, at this point,
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.980]   I always make an argument
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.100]   that our physical theories always change.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.140]   They get updated.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.820]   So you had Newton's theory of gravity.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.740]   Then Einstein's theory superseded it.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.780]   But in mathematics, it seems that theories don't change.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.860]   Pythagoras' theorem has been the same
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.000]   for the last 2,500 years.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.680]   X squared plus y squared equals z squared.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.360]   We don't expect that next year, suddenly,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.080]   it will be z cubed, you know?
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.480]   So that, to me, is actually even more,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.200]   hints even more at how much we are connected to each other,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.720]   because Pythagoras' theory, if you think about it,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.700]   or any other mathematical theorem,
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.960]   means the same thing to anyone in the world today,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.600]   regardless of their cultural, you know,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   bringing religion, you know, ideas, ideology,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.140]   gender, whatever, nationality, race, whatever, right?
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.500]   And it has meant the same to everyone, everywhere,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.900]   and most likely will mean the same.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.680]   So that's, to me, kind of an antidote
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.900]   to the kind of divisiveness
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.180]   that we sometimes observe these days,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.820]   where it seems that we can't agree on anything.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.720]   - To the political complexity of two plus two equals five
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.140]   in George Orwell's "1984."
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.860]   - I was in the Soviet Union in 1984,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.580]   and so in many ways, I see that it was prescient,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.140]   the novel was prescient,
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.620]   but we still have not found a dictator
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.060]   who would actually say two plus two equals five,
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.060]   and would demand their citizens to repeat that.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   - The knight is still young.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.820]   - Has not happened yet, okay?
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.980]   - Yeah, it does feel like math and physics
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.860]   are both sneaking up to a deep truth
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.540]   from slightly different angles,
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.820]   and you stand at the crossroads
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.900]   or at the intersection of the two.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.820]   It's interesting to ask,
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.820]   what do you think is the difference
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.700]   between physics and mathematics,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.060]   and the way physics and mathematics look at the world?
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.840]   - There is actually an essential difference,
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.420]   which is that physicists are interested
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.060]   in describing this universe, okay?
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.380]   And mathematicians are interested in describing
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.380]   all possible mathematical universes,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.940]   of which, in some of our work,
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.700]   I still consider myself more of a mathematician
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.220]   than a physicist, my first love for physics notwithstanding.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.000]   Mathematicians are, in a way,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.940]   we have more diversity, if you might say.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.380]   So we are accepting, for instance,
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:18.380]   our universe has three spatial dimensions,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.780]   and one time dimension, right?
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.100]   So what I mean is that--
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.980]   - Allegedly.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.420]   - Allegedly, observed, but that we can observe today, right?
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.740]   So of course there are theories
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.260]   where there are some hidden dimensions as well.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.500]   Well, let's just say observed dimensions.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.660]   So this tabletop has two dimensions
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.940]   because you can have two coordinate axes,
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.740]   X and Y, but then there is also a third one
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.860]   to describe the space of this room.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.900]   And then there's a time dimension.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.700]   So realistic theories of physics have to be
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:57.220]   about spaces of three dimensions,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.580]   or space-time, so four dimensions.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.700]   But mathematically, we are just as interested
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.220]   in theories in 10 space-time dimensions,
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.500]   or 11, or 25, or whatever,
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.680]   or infinite dimensional spaces, you know?
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.900]   So that's the difference.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.740]   On the other hand, I have to give it to the physicists,
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.460]   we don't have the same satisfaction that they have
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.460]   of having their theories confirmed by an experiment.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.020]   We don't get to play with big machines like LHC in Geneva,
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.180]   large Hadron Collider that recently discovered,
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.140]   you know, the Higgs boson and some other things.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.220]   For us, it's all like a mental exercise in some sense.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.620]   We prove things by using rules of logic,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.420]   and that's our way of confirming,
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.660]   experimental confirmation, if you will.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.940]   But I think I kind of envy a little bit
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.220]   my friends physicists that they get to experience
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.180]   this sort of, these big toys, you know, and play with them.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.620]   - But it does seem that sometimes,
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.340]   as you've spoken about, abstract mathematical concepts
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.620]   map to reality, and it seems to happen quite a bit.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.860]   - That's right, so mathematics underpins physics, obviously.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.980]   It's a language.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.980]   The book of nature, as Galileo famously said,
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.540]   is written in the language of mathematics.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:25.100]   And the letters in it are the circles, triangles, and squares
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.260]   and those who don't know the language, I'm paraphrasing,
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.700]   are left to wander in a dark labyrinth.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.940]   That's a famous quote from Galileo, which is very true
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.660]   and has become even more true more recently
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.660]   in theoretical physics in the most sort of far out,
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.300]   far out parts of the theoretical physics
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.060]   that have to do with elementary particles
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.980]   and as well as the structure of the cosmos
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.220]   at the large scale.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.540]   - What do you think of Max Tegmarker
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.660]   who wrote the book Mathematical Universe?
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.460]   So do you think, just lingering on that point,
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.320]   you think at the end of the day,
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.940]   the future generations will all be mathematicians?
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.340]   Meaning the ones that deeply understand
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.420]   the way the universe works.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.980]   At the core, is it just mathematics?
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.980]   - At the core of, you know,
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:28.140]   I would say mathematics is one half of the core.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.140]   So the book is called Love and Math.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.980]   - Yeah. - Okay, so these are
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.460]   the two pillars. (laughs)
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.860]   - Yeah. - In my view.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.220]   In other words, you can't cover everything by math.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.780]   So mathematics gives you tools,
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.780]   it gives you a kind of a clear vision.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.060]   But mathematics by itself is not enough
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:55.060]   for one to have a harmonious and balanced life.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.580]   So I am suspicious of any theory
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.520]   that declares that everything is mathematics.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.620]   - So math can generate things that are beautiful,
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.300]   but it can't explain why it's beautiful.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.180]   Math, you could say, is a way to discern patterns,
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.620]   to find regularities in the universe,
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.780]   and both physical and mental universe.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.780]   Mathematics explores the mind
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.780]   as much as it explores the physical world around us.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.180]   And it helps us to find those patterns,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.180]   which makes our perception more sophisticated,
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.760]   our ability to perceive things such as beauty.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.340]   It sharpens our ability to see beauty,
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.300]   to understand beauty.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.180]   So our world becomes more complex
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:51.660]   from thinking that Earth is flat,
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.180]   we go to realizing that it is round,
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.340]   that it's the shape of the sphere,
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.420]   so that we can actually travel around the Earth,
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.440]   so there isn't a place where we hit the end, so to speak.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.220]   And then proceeding in the same vein,
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.420]   then Einstein's general relativity theory tells us
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.400]   that our space-time is not flat either.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.060]   This is much harder to imagine,
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.940]   the bent three-dimensional or four-dimensional space,
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.380]   or four-dimensional space-time,
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.260]   because this idea that the space around us is flat
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.860]   is so deeply entrenched.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.260]   And yet we know from this theory
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.620]   and from the experiments that have confirmed it,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.660]   that a ray of light bends around a star
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.340]   as if being attracted by the force of gravity.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.040]   But in fact, the force of gravity is the bending.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   It's just that it's not only the bending of the space,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.460]   it's also the bending of space-time.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.020]   There is a curvature,
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.500]   not only between spatial dimensions,
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.020]   the way parallels and meridians come together.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   In a small scale, they look like perpendicular lines,
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.860]   but if you zoom out, you see that the space,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.100]   are they curving the space?
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.620]   They are sort of the tracks
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.820]   along which the space gets curved.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.140]   That would be the curvature of spatial dimensions.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.060]   But in fact, now throwing time,
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.140]   and one time, imagine a sphere which has,
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.700]   one of the meridians correspond to time,
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.260]   and the parallels correspond to space.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.580]   I can't imagine it, but I can write a mathematical formula
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.420]   expressing that curvature.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.940]   And that's, in fact, that curvature is responsible
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.820]   for the force of gravity, attraction between,
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.940]   the sort of simplest instantiation of it,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.100]   attraction between two planets,
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.740]   or between two human beings.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.580]   (laughs)
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.780]   What does matter?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.300]   - Yeah, the time, bending time,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.740]   it's not very nice what that theory did to time,
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.100]   because it feels like the marching of time forward
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.780]   is fundamental to our human experience.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.260]   The arrow of time marching forward nicely
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.220]   seems to be the only way we can understand the universe.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.060]   And the fact that you can start--
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.620]   - Up to now, up to now.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.260]   There are people who claim that they can,
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.500]   that they possess other ways of experiencing it.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.100]   - So truly can visualize messing with time.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.540]   - Well, messing with time,
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.860]   but not necessarily messing with time,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.540]   because one point of view is that,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.420]   I think, who was it?
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.660]   I think William Blake,
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.820]   who wrote that eternity loves time production.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.220]   So one point of view is that it is eternity
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.300]   which is fundamental, where time stands still,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.720]   which our mind conceptualizes as the time.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.660]   But in fact, it's not something mystical.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.380]   If you think about it,
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.220]   when you're really absorbed in something,
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.740]   time does stand still.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.820]   And then you look at the clock, and it's like,
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.940]   "Oh my God, two hours have passed."
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.360]   And it felt like a couple of seconds.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.940]   When you are absorbed, when you're in love,
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.500]   when you are passionate about something,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.060]   when you're creating something,
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.580]   we lose ourselves, and we lose the sense of time,
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.260]   and space, for that matter, you see?
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.380]   So there is only that which is happening,
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.600]   that creative process.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.820]   So I think that this is familiar to all of us.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.340]   - And we may be actually the closest
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.900]   to the truth at that moment,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.140]   to the true natural reality.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.540]   - So yes, so then there is a point of view
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.720]   that this is where we are, we are who we are,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.280]   at our sort of fundamental, at our fundamental level.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.080]   And after that, the mind comes in,
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.840]   and tries to conceptualize it.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.240]   It's like, "Oh, because I was writing something.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.760]   "I was writing a book, I was painting this painting,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.480]   "or maybe I was watching this painting,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.240]   "and got totally absorbed in it.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   "Or I fell in love with this person, that's what happened."
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.560]   But in the moment when it's happening,
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.520]   you're not thinking about it.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.000]   You're just there.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.620]   - Yeah, we construct narratives around
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.040]   the set of memories that seem to have happened in sequence,
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.920]   or at least that's the way we tell ourselves that.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.820]   And we also have a bunch of weird human things,
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.340]   like consciousness, and the experience of free will,
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.340]   that we chose a set of actions as the time unrolled forward.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.540]   And we are intelligent, conscious agents,
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.020]   taking those actions.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.860]   But what if all of that is just--
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.700]   - An illusion.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.320]   - An illusion, and a nice narrative we tell ourselves?
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   - Sure.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.000]   - That's a really difficult thing to internalize.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.840]   - It's possible.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.480]   And imagine that to make it really Catch-22.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.340]   Imagine that our minds are set up in such a way
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.560]   that they can't approach the world,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.920]   or experience otherwise.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.240]   So in other words, to understand,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.320]   to see that from a more
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.080]   kind of all-encompassing point of view,
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.680]   we have to step out of the mind.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.180]   - Well, I wonder what's the more honest way
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.000]   to look at things.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.560]   - But I think we like to play with time.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.600]   I think we like to play with these experiences,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.560]   with all the drama of it, with all the memories,
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.820]   with all the tribulations.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.660]   - I think that's--
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.720]   - We love it, we love it.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   Otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.920]   - I think that's, or Earth loves it.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.000]   The evolutionary process somehow loves it.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.760]   Whatever this thing that's being created here on Earth,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.000]   it seems to like to create,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.640]   like to allow its children to play with certain
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.480]   truths that they hold, the subjective truths
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.140]   that are useful for the competition,
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.400]   or whatever this dance that we call life
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.480]   broadly is defined, not just humans.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.400]   - And you know, I'm glad you mentioned that,
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.680]   because what I find fascinating
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.040]   is that the greatest scientists are on record
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.320]   saying that when they were making their discoveries,
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.000]   they felt like children.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.720]   So Isaac Newton said to myself,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.480]   "I only appeared as a child playing on the seashore,
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.960]   "and every once in a while finding a prettier pebble
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.820]   "or a prettier shell," whilst I think he said something like
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.820]   "The infinite ocean of knowledge was lying before me."
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.640]   Alexander Grothendieck, who probably was
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.680]   the greatest mathematician of the second half
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.760]   of the 20th century, the French mathematician,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.240]   Alexander Grothendieck, wrote that
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.280]   discovery is a privilege of a child.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.480]   A child who is not afraid to be wrong once again,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.800]   to look like an idiot, to try this and that,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.560]   I'm paraphrasing, and go through trial and error.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.500]   That is for them, in other words, for them,
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:39.220]   that innocence of a child who is not afraid,
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.720]   who has not yet been told that it cannot be done,
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.360]   that was essential to scientific pursuit,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.320]   to scientific discovery.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   And now, also, compare it to Pablo Picasso,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.680]   a great artist, right, who said,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.920]   "Every child is an artist."
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.220]   The question is how to preserve that as we grow up.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.320]   - Do you struggle with that?
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.920]   You're one of the most respected
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.380]   mathematicians in the world.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.040]   You're Berkeley, you're like, there's a statue,
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.560]   you're supposed to be very like, you know--
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.400]   - Ivory Tower.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.040]   - Yeah. - Sometimes I joke, I say,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   I take an elevator to the top of the Ivory Tower every day.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.640]   - And you're supposed to speak like royalty.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.080]   Do you struggle to strip all of that away
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.640]   to rediscover the child when you're thinking about problems,
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.280]   when you're teaching, when you're thinking about the world?
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.400]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.720]   I mean, that's part of being human,
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.200]   because when we grow up, I mean,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.960]   all of these great scientists,
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.720]   I think they were so great in part,
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.840]   because they were able, they maintained that connection,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.940]   okay, and that fascination, that vulnerability,
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.680]   that spontaneity, you know,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.000]   and kind of looking at the world
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   through the eyes of a child.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.120]   But it's difficult, because you go through education system,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   and for many of us, it's not especially helpful
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.760]   for maintaining that connection,
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.000]   that we kind of like, we're being told certain things
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.080]   that we accept, take for granted, and so on,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.560]   and little by little, and also, we get hit
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.640]   every time we act different, okay?
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.480]   Every time we act in a way
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.400]   that doesn't fit sort of the pattern.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.960]   We get punished by the teachers,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.560]   get punished by parents, and so on.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.240]   - And don't get respect when you act childlike
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.360]   in your thinking, when you are fearless
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.840]   and looking like an idiot.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.680]   - That's right.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.520]   - Because there's a hierarchy in society.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.600]   - Nobody wants to look like an idiot, you know?
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.720]   Once you start growing up, or you think you're growing up.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.640]   In the beginning, you don't even think in these terms.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.980]   You just play, you're just playing,
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.240]   and you are open to possibilities,
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.600]   to these infinite possibilities
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   that this world presents to us.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.480]   So how do we, I'm not saying that education system
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.040]   should not be also kind of taming that a little bit.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   Obviously, the goal is balance,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.120]   that acquiring knowledge so that we can be more mature
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.080]   and more discerning, more discriminating
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.880]   in terms of our approach to the world,
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.800]   in terms of our connections to the world
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.440]   and people and so on.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.040]   But how do we do that while also preserving
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.760]   that innocence of a child?
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.640]   And my guess is that there is no formula for this.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.760]   It is, a life is an answer.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.640]   Every life, every human being is one particular answer
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.800]   to how do we find balance.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:55.120]   - That's one imperfect approximation,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.000]   approximate solution to the problem.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.360]   - But we can look up to the great ones
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   who have credentials in the sense that they have shown
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.280]   and they have proved that they have done something
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.400]   that other humans appreciate, our civilization appreciates,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.960]   say, Isaac Newton or Alexander Grotendieck
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.280]   or Pablo Picasso.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.760]   So they have established their right
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.640]   to speak about these matters.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.720]   And we cannot dismiss them as mere madmen.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.280]   They say, okay, well, if the same thing was said
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.200]   by somebody who never achieved anything
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   in their field of endeavor,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.560]   it would be easy for us to dismiss it.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.280]   But when it comes from someone like Isaac Newton,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.880]   we take notice.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.720]   So I think there's something important that they teach us.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.880]   And especially today, in this age of AI,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.440]   of course, there's a big elephant in the room always,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.320]   which is called AI, right?
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.520]   And so I know that you are an expert in the subject
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.000]   and we are living now in this very interesting times
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.960]   of new AI systems coming online,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.440]   pretty much every couple of weeks.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   So I kind of, to me, that whole debate about
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.960]   what is it, what is artificial intelligence,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.240]   where is it going, what should we do about it,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.520]   needs an influx of this type of considerations
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.600]   that we've just been talking about.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.240]   That, for instance, the idea that inspiration,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   creativity doesn't come from accumulation of knowledge,
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.420]   because obviously a child has not yet accumulated knowledge.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.540]   And yet the great ones are on record
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:45.540]   saying that a child has a capacity to create.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.220]   And an adult credits the inner child--
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.900]   - The inner child, yeah.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.180]   - For this capacity to create as an adult, you see.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.980]   That's kind of weird if we take the point of view
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.660]   that everything is computation,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.340]   everything is accumulation of knowledge,
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.060]   that just bigger and bigger data sets,
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.340]   finer and finer neural networks,
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.480]   and then we will be able to replicate human consciousness.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.060]   If we take that point of view,
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.820]   then what I just said kind of doesn't fit,
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.780]   because obviously a child has not been fed
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.540]   any training data as far as we know,
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.140]   yet they're perfectly capable of distinguishing
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.660]   between cats and dogs, for instance, and stuff like that.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.620]   But much more than that, they're also capable of that
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:35.000]   wide-eyed sort of perspective.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.940]   So can it really be captured, that perspective,
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.820]   that sense of awe, can it really be captured
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.060]   by computation alone?
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.500]   I actually, I don't know the answer,
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.980]   so I'm not sort of trying to present
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.100]   a particular point of view.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.060]   I'm just trying to question any theory
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.620]   that starts out by saying life is this,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.500]   or consciousness is this.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.800]   Because when you look more closely,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.660]   you recognize that there are some other things at play,
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   which do not quite fit the narrative.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.260]   - And it's hard to know where they come from.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.740]   It's also possible that the evolutionary process
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.500]   that's created is the very, it is computation,
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.560]   and the child is actually not a blank slate,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.120]   but the result of one of the most incredible,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.340]   several billion year old computations
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:39.740]   that had explored all kinds of aspects of life on Earth,
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:48.020]   of war and love and terror and ambition
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.020]   and violence and invention, all of that,
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.500]   from the bacteria to today.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.300]   So that young child is not a blank slate.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.500]   They're coming, they're actually,
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.660]   hold within them the knowledge
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.140]   of several billions of years.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.660]   - Right, the question is whether, as a child,
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.300]   you carry that in the form of the kind
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.180]   of computational algorithms that we are aware today.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.980]   You see, what strikes me as unlikely is that,
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.420]   how should I put it?
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.180]   How interesting that, you know,
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.760]   you are a computer scientist,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.020]   and there are other people,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.220]   I have studied computer science, so I know a little bit.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.100]   And so it's tempting to say,
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.060]   oh, the whole world is computer science,
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.460]   or is based, can be explained by computer science.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.300]   Why?
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.500]   Because it makes me feel good.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.620]   Because I have mastered it, I have learned it.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.120]   My ego is very happy, and people come to me,
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.100]   and they look up to me, and they revere me.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.260]   Kind of like priests in old days,
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.700]   when religion was paramount,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.540]   when you would tend to explain things
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.940]   in theological, religious terms.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.460]   Today, science has progressed.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.460]   There are fewer people who kind of buy into official religion.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.280]   You know?
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.980]   So we have this urge, I suppose, to explain,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.180]   and to know, and to dissect, and to analyze,
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.140]   and to conceptualize, which is a wonderful quality
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.980]   that we have, and we should definitely pursue that.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.680]   But I find it a little bit unlikely
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.380]   that the universe is just exactly what I have learned,
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.860]   and not something that I don't know, you see?
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.220]   - Well, there's a lot of interesting aspects
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.900]   to the current large language models
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.020]   that one perspective of it, I think,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.300]   speaks to the love in math that you talk to,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   which is they're trained on human data from the internet.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.980]   So at its best, a large language model,
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.980]   like GPT-4, captures the magic of the human condition
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.780]   on its full display, its full complexity.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.540]   And so it's mimicking, it's trying to compress
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.900]   all the weirdness of humans,
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.100]   of all the debates and discussions, the perspectives,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.300]   all the different ways that people approach
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.740]   solving different problems, all of that compressed.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.300]   So we live, we're each individual ants.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.160]   We only have, like, we have a family,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.300]   we interact with a few little ants.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.980]   And here comes AI that's able to summarize,
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.740]   like a TLDR, Report of Humanity.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.260]   - And that's the beauty of it.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.780]   So I embrace it.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.020]   - But I wonder if-- - I'm very impressed by it.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.580]   - I wonder if it can be very impressive,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:46.580]   meaning way more impressive in being able to fake
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.500]   or simulate or emulate a human.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.580]   - Fake, I'm glad you mentioned that,
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.880]   because that seems to be the mantra.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.720]   - It's just a word, though.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.060]   - Fake it 'til you make it.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.900]   - Yeah. - Isn't it?
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.800]   - Isn't that what we all do, though?
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.680]   - No, well, yes, we do that, but we also do other things.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.520]   We can be truly in love, we can be truly inspired
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.500]   when it is not fake.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.320]   I do believe, call me romantic, okay, but I do believe,
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.240]   and this is a very good, I'm glad you're putting it
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.960]   in these terms, because I've had conversations like that.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.760]   That, yeah, fake it 'til you make it,
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   but that's like, that's what humans do.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.840]   Yes, we do that, but not all the time.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.020]   So, and that is debatable,
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.460]   because also I speak from my own experience,
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.220]   and that's where the first-person perspective comes in,
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.100]   the subjective view.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.480]   I cannot prove to you, for instance, or anyone else,
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.000]   that there are certain moments in my life
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.820]   where I am genuine, I am pure, so to speak,
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.200]   when it's not faking it,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.920]   but I do have a tremendous certainty of it,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.960]   and that's a subjective certainty.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.040]   Now, I am, as a scientist, I'm also trained
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.760]   to give more credibility to objective arguments
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.280]   that are things that can be reproduced,
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.420]   things that I can demonstrate, that I can show.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.200]   But as I get older, (laughs)
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.720]   show me, Steve. - There we go.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.420]   - As I get more mature, hopefully, you know,
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.400]   I'm starting to question why I am not giving
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.840]   as much credibility to my subjective understanding
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.520]   of the world, the kind of the first-person perspective.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.300]   When actually, modern science has already sold on that.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.520]   You know, quantum mechanics has shown unambiguously
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.240]   that the observer is always involved in the observation.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.500]   Likewise, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to me,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:41.600]   show how essential is the observer
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.640]   of a mathematical theory.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.160]   For one thing, that's the one who chooses the axioms.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.880]   And we can talk about this in more detail.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.400]   Likewise, Einstein's relativity,
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.880]   where time is relative to the observer, for instance.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.720]   - That's brilliant.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.200]   You're just describing all of these different scales,
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.760]   the observer, what the observer means.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.000]   - So, science of 19th century had the,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.640]   from modern perspective, and I don't want to offend anybody,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.280]   had the delusion that somehow you could analyze the world
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.200]   being completely detached from it.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   We now know, after the landmark achievements
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.180]   of the first half of the 20th century,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.120]   that this is nonsense, that it's simply not true.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.760]   And this has been experimentally proved time and time again.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.600]   So, to me, I'm thinking maybe it's a hint
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.500]   that I should take my first-person perspective
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.740]   seriously as well, and not just rely
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.960]   on kind of objective phenomena,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.960]   things that can be proved in a traditional,
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.440]   sort of objective way, by setting up an experiment
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.340]   that can be repeated many times.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.160]   Maybe I fall in love, the deepest love of my life,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.440]   perhaps, perhaps hasn't happened yet,
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.360]   perhaps I will fall in love, but it's unique.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.320]   It's a unique event.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.800]   You can't reproduce it, necessarily, you see?
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.080]   So, in that sense, you see how these things
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.600]   are closely connected.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.640]   I think that if we are declaring from the outset
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.240]   that all there is to life is computation
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.280]   in the form of neural networks or something like this,
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.300]   however sophisticated they might be,
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.380]   I think we are, from the outset, denying to ourselves
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.660]   the possibility that, yes, there is a side of me
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.060]   which is not faking it.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.220]   Yes, there is a side of me which cannot be captured
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.580]   by logic and reason.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.700]   And you know what another great scientist said,
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   bless Pascal, he said, "The heart has its reasons,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.500]   "of which the reason knows nothing."
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.400]   And then he also said, "The last step of reason
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.620]   "is to grasp that there are infinitely many things
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.700]   "beyond reason."
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.860]   How interesting, this was not a theologian,
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.400]   this was not a priest, this was not a spiritual guru.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.900]   It was a hardcore scientist who actually developed,
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.100]   I think, one of the very first calculators.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.140]   How interesting that this guy also was able
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.520]   to impart on us that wisdom.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.860]   Now, you can always say that's not the case.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.860]   But why should we, from the outset,
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.000]   exclude this possibility that there is something
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.200]   to what he was saying?
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.360]   That is my question.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.460]   I'm not taking sides.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:30.140]   What I'm trying to do is to shake a little bit the debate
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.140]   because most mathematicians that I know,
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.040]   and computer scientists even more so,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.880]   they're kind of already sold on this.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.380]   We are just, you know, it reminds me of this famous
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.420]   Lord Kelvin's quote from the end of 19th century.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.460]   There's some debate whether he actually said that,
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.460]   but never let a good story stand in the way of truth.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.380]   He said, "Physics is basically finished.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.740]   "All that remains is more precise measurement."
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.460]   So I find a lot of my colleagues are happy to say,
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.940]   "Everything's finished, we got it, we got it."
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.940]   Maybe a little tweaks in our large language models.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.780]   So now, here's my question.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.820]   I'm kind of playing devil's advocate a little bit
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.700]   because I don't see the other side
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.680]   of the so-called code represented that much.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.080]   And I'm saying, okay, could it be also that
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.060]   if you believe in that, that that becomes your reality?
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.020]   That you can kind of put yourself in a box
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.520]   where everything is computation,
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.340]   and then you start seeing things as being such.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.300]   It's confirmation bias, if you will.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.540]   This also reminds me, I think a good analogy
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.460]   is a friend of mine, Philippe Cauchon,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.700]   told me that in France, there is this literary movement,
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.700]   which is called Oulipo, O-U-L-I-P-O.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.980]   And it's a bunch of writers and mathematicians
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.540]   who create works of literature
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.300]   in which they basically impose certain constraints.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.680]   A good example of this.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.240]   Is a novel, which is called "The Void or Disappearance"
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.560]   by a writer named Georges Pirek,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.360]   which is a 300-page novel in French,
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:22.060]   which never uses the letter E,
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.900]   which is the most widely used letter of the French language.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.820]   So in other words, he set these parameters for himself.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.060]   I'm going to write a book where I don't use this letter,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.480]   which is a great experiment.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.360]   And I applaud it.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.720]   But it's one thing to do that
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.320]   and to kind of show his gamesmanship, if you will,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.840]   and his ability as a writer.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.240]   But it's another thing if at the end of writing this book,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.080]   when you finish the book,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.200]   he would say letter E actually doesn't exist.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.640]   And try to convince us that in fact,
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   French language does not have that letter,
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.800]   simply because he was able to go so far
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.700]   without using it, you see.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.160]   So self-imposed limitation, that's how I see it.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:13.080]   And I wonder why we should do that.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.880]   Do we really feel the urge to say the world is like that?
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.520]   The world can be explained this way or that way.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.760]   And I'm saying it, it's a personal question for me,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.140]   because I am addicted to knowledge myself.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.720]   Hi, my name is Edward.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.560]   (both laughing)
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.400]   - I'm addicted to knowledge.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.880]   - And I'm a knowledge addict, okay?
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.240]   I'm being serious, I'm not being facetious.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.900]   Up until very recently, maybe a couple of years ago,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.100]   I simply did not feel comfortable
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.220]   if I could not say, give an answer, explanation.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.740]   It's like, oh, there has to be some explanation.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.220]   And I try to frantically search for it.
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:53.220]   Just for somebody like me, a nerd, a left brainiac,
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:59.380]   and that's kind of typical for a scientist,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.860]   for a mathematician, it is incredibly hard.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   Just to allow the possibility that it's a mystery
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:14.000]   and not to feel the urge to get the answer,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.200]   it is incredibly hard, but it's possible.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.720]   And it is liberating.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.840]   It's recovering, it's recovering, I think.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.080]   (both laughing)
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.600]   To knowledge.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.960]   Let me say what you gain from it.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.200]   For instance, I understand the value of paradoxes.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.840]   I appreciate paradoxes more.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.840]   And to use another philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.480]   the Danish philosopher, said,
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.920]   "A thinker without paradox is like a lover without passion."
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.000]   (both laughing)
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.200]   A paltry mediocrity.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.440]   - Ooh, that's a good line.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.560]   - All right?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   So, and Niels Bohr said, in the same vein,
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.920]   the great Danish also.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.120]   It's something about Danes.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.920]   I think it all started with Hamlet.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.680]   (both laughing)
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   He said, "The opposite of a simple truth is a falsity,
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.720]   "but the opposite of a great truth is another great truth."
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.120]   In other words, things are not black and white.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.520]   You know, they're not...
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.720]   And I would even venture to say,
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   the most interesting things in life are like that.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.920]   The ones which are ambiguous.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.560]   Is an electron a particle or a wave?
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.220]   It depends how you set up an experiment.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.200]   It will reveal itself as this or that,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.460]   depending on how you set up an experiment.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:44.000]   This bottle, if you project it down onto the table,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.040]   you will see more or less a square.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.240]   If you project it onto a wall, you will see a different shape.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.280]   A naive question would be, is it this or that?
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.360]   Because we understand that it's neither.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.720]   But both projections reveal something.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.840]   They reveal different sides of it.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.560]   A paradox is like that.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.040]   It's only paradoxical if we are confined
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.640]   in a particular vision,
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.800]   if we are wedded to a particular point of view.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.080]   It's a harbinger, if you will,
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   of a possibility of seeing things as they are,
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.760]   as more sophisticated than we thought before.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.600]   You see?
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.360]   - This is such a difficult idea for science to grapple with.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.640]   That, you know, I don't know how,
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.920]   there's so many ways to describe this,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.720]   but you could say maybe that the subjective experience
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   of the world from an observer is actually fundamental.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.440]   - But we know that.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.320]   Our best physical theories tell us that unambiguously.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.520]   In quantum mechanics, actually, you know,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.080]   Heisenberg, I think, captured it the best
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.560]   when he said, "What we observe is not reality itself,
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.680]   "but reality subjected to our method of questioning."
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.320]   When I talk about electrons, for instance,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.840]   so that there is a very specific way
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.760]   in which this is realized.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   There is a so-called double-slit experiment, right?
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.520]   So for those who don't know,
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.920]   it's you have a screen and you have an emitter
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.800]   from which you send, you kind of shoot electrons.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.440]   And in between, you put another screen
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.680]   which has two vertical slits parallel to each other.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.800]   If we were shooting, you know, tennis balls,
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.120]   each ball would go through one slit or another
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.640]   and then hit the screen behind this or that slit.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.920]   So you would have, let's say they're colored,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.120]   they're painted.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.080]   So there'll be sort of bumps or spots of paint
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.920]   behind this or that.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   But that's not what happens when we shoot electrons.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.400]   We see an interference pattern
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.600]   as if we were actually sending a wave
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.520]   so that each electron,
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.080]   it seems like each electron goes through both slits at once
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.960]   and then has the audacity to interfere with itself.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.080]   Where at some points, you know, two crests would amplify
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.440]   and at some points, a crest and a trough
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.520]   would cancel each other.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.920]   Yet, so that suggests, okay, so an electron is a wave?
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.400]   Not so fast, because if you put a detector
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.840]   behind one of the slits and you say,
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.480]   I'm going to capture you. (laughs)
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.520]   I'm going to find out which slit you went through,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.720]   the pattern will change
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.960]   and it will look like they're particles.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.000]   So that's a very concrete realization of the idea
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.520]   that depending on how we set up an experiment,
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.040]   we will see different results.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.880]   And the problem is that our psyche, I feel,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.360]   kind of is lagging behind,
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.240]   in part because maybe our scientists
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.360]   are not doing such a great job.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.000]   So I take responsibility for this,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.680]   that why haven't I explained this properly?
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.160]   I tried, you know, in a bunch of talks and so on.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.520]   So now I'm talking about this again.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.880]   Our psyche kind of is lagging behind.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.560]   We're still, even though our science has progressed so much
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.720]   from the certainty and the determinism
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.400]   and all of that of the 19th century,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.920]   our psyche is somehow still attached to those ideas.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.120]   The ideas of causality, of this naive determinism,
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.520]   that the world is a bunch of billiard balls
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.880]   hitting each other, driven by some blind forces.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.560]   You know, that's not at all like it is.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.680]   And we've known this for over,
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.880]   well, for about 100 years at least, you know?
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.680]   - And you call this self-imposed limitation.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.040]   - It is a self-imposed limitation when we pretend that,
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:36.640]   for instance, that these naive ideas of 19th century physics
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.680]   are still valid and then start applying them to our lives
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.640]   and then also derive conclusions from it.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.600]   And for instance, people say, "There is no free will."
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.760]   Why?
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.840]   "Oh, because the world is just a bunch of billiard balls.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.760]   "So where is the free will?"
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.040]   But excuse me, didn't you get the memo
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.160]   that this has been debunked thoroughly
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.840]   by the so-called quantum mechanics,
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.800]   which is our best scientific theory?
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.160]   This is not some kind of bullshit
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   or some kind of concoction of a madman.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.000]   This is our scientific theory,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.600]   which has been confirmed by experiment.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.280]   So we should pay attention to that.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.720]   So, but of course, it's not just self-imposed limitation.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.040]   Unfortunately, in this case,
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.520]   there is a big issue of education.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.600]   So a lot of people are not aware of it
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.060]   through no fault of their own,
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.520]   because they were never properly taught that,
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.280]   because our system is broken, education system is broken,
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.920]   especially in math.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.720]   And then our, so where do we get information?
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.440]   You get information from our scientists
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.320]   who actually write popular books and so on,
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:42.040]   which is a great, you know, great thing that they do.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.900]   But a lot of scientists somehow,
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:49.240]   when it comes to explaining the laws of physics,
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.760]   they're doing a fantastic job
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.920]   talking about this phenomenon,
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.520]   for instance, double-slit experiment and things like that.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   But then, you know, interviewed by Science Magazine
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.720]   about free will and so on,
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.160]   they revert back to 19th century physics
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.360]   as if those developments actually never happened.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.640]   So to me, this is single most
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   important sort of issue in our popular science.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.120]   The idea that somehow there is this world out there,
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.140]   but it has nothing to do with me.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:28.440]   So I can revel in the intricacies
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.040]   of these particles and their interactions,
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.020]   but completely ignore what implications this has
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.800]   for my own relationship to physical reality,
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.600]   to my own life, you know?
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.400]   Because it's kind of scary, I guess, you know?
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.080]   - But also, what are the tools
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:51.800]   with which we can talk about the observer,
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.700]   the subjective view on reality?
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.760]   What are the tools with which we could talk about,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.880]   rigorously talk about free will and consciousness?
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.240]   What are the tools of mathematics that allow that?
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.680]   I don't think we have those tools.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.860]   - Because we haven't been taught properly.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.060]   So actually, tools are there.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:14.760]   For instance, I think, well,
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.600]   here we have to, I have to say,
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.320]   my conviction is that everybody knows.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.700]   In the heart of hearts, everybody knows that there is that.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.620]   There is something ineffable.
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.420]   There is something mysterious.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.680]   And in fact, you know, somehow,
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   immediately I feel the impulse to quote somebody on this,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.020]   because as if my own opinion doesn't count.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.320]   (laughing)
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.600]   - There's a long-dead expert that has said it.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.980]   - Even Einstein said that, you know?
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.940]   So like, how, see, look at me.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.860]   I am supposedly like this smart, intelligent person.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.260]   I am afraid to say it and own it myself.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.620]   I have to find confirmation.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.780]   I have to find an authority who agrees with me.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.340]   And in fact, it's not so difficult to find,
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.200]   because Albert Einstein literally said
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.940]   the most important thing in life is the mysterious.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.840]   Okay, he actually said that.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.300]   There are some quotes which are attributed to him,
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.480]   which he never said, but this he did.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.780]   I investigated, okay?
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.540]   (laughing)
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.280]   But more importantly, you know, how do you feel about it?
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.160]   I think that everybody knows.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   But in other words, he also said, Einstein,
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.620]   imagination is more important than knowledge, okay?
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.180]   And he explained, for knowledge is always limited.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:40.180]   Whereas imagination embraces the entire world,
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.780]   giving birth to evolution.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.620]   It is, strictly speaking, a real factor
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.100]   in scientific research, he says.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.940]   And he says, I am enough of an artist
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.460]   to follow my intuition and imagination.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.220]   That's Albert Einstein, again.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.860]   So, and I feel the same way, to be honest.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.160]   If I think about my own mathematical research,
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.060]   it's never linear.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.340]   It's never like, give me more data, give me more data,
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.020]   give me more data, boom, the glass is full,
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.460]   and then I come up with a discovery.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.060]   No, it's always felt as a jump, as a leap.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:16.980]   And I have actually been studying various examples
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.060]   in history of mathematics, of some fundamental discoveries,
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.380]   like discovery of complex numbers,
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.020]   like square root of negative one.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.180]   I wonder if a large language model
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.060]   could actually ever come up with the idea
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.260]   that square root of negative one
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:36.580]   is something that is essential or meaningful.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.180]   Because if all the information that you get,
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.460]   that all the knowledge that had been accumulated
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.340]   up to that point, tells you that you cannot
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.540]   have a square root of a negative number, why?
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.760]   Because if you had such a square root,
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.220]   we know that if you square it, you get a negative number.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.020]   But we know that if you square any real number,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.540]   positive or negative, you will always get a positive number.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.940]   So, checkmate, it's over.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.700]   Square root of negative one doesn't exist.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.940]   Yet, we know that these numbers make sense,
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.300]   they're called complex numbers,
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.940]   and in fact, quantum mechanics is based on complex numbers.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.100]   They are essential and indispensable for quantum mechanics.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.300]   Could one discover that?
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.340]   So, to me, that sounds like a discontinuity
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.900]   in the process of discovery.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.900]   It's a jump, it's a departure.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.220]   It is like a child who is experimenting.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.580]   It's like a child who says, "I'm not afraid to be an idiot."
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.780]   Everybody says, the adults are saying,
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.380]   square root of negative number doesn't exist,
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.540]   but guess what?
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.940]   I'm going to accept it, and I'm going to play with it,
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.700]   and I'm going to see what happens.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.620]   This is literally how they were discovered.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.620]   There was an Italian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer.
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.580]   He made money, apparently, by compiling astrological
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:02.740]   sort of readings for the elite of his era.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:03.580]   - As one does.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.260]   - This is 16th century, as one does.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.300]   A gambler. (laughs)
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.500]   All around interesting guy.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.620]   I'm sure we would have an interesting conversation with him.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.380]   Gerolamo Cardano.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.780]   He also invented what's called cardan shaft,
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.540]   which is an essential component of a car.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.980]   Cardano Vival, we say in Russian.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:28.940]   So he wrote a book which is called Ars Magna,
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.260]   which is like the great art of algebra.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.540]   And he was writing solutions
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:36.020]   for the cubic and quartic equations.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.420]   This is something that is familiar,
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.180]   because at school we study solutions of quadratic equations,
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.660]   equations of degree two.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:47.140]   So you have AX squared plus BX plus C equals zero.
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.060]   And there is a formula which solves it using radicals,
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.620]   using square roots.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.900]   And Cardano was trying to find a similar formula
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.620]   for the cubic and quartic equations,
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.300]   for which would start with X cubed or X to the power four,
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.340]   as opposed to X squared.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.020]   And in the process of solving these equations,
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.660]   he came up with square root of a negative number,
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.660]   specifically square root of minus 17.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.460]   And he wrote that I have to forego some mental tortures
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:19.540]   to deal with it, but I am going to accept it
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:20.700]   and see what happens.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.740]   And in fact, at the end of the calculation,
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.540]   these weird numbers got canceled.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.540]   They kind of canceled out.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.740]   And the formula appeared, square root of negative 17,
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:32.580]   and it's negation.
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.340]   So they kind of conveniently gave the right answer,
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.020]   which did not involve those numbers.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:40.780]   So he was like, "Okay, what does it mean?
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.300]   "Mental tortures."
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:47.100]   So you see, from the point of view of the thinking mind,
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.140]   it is something almost unbearable.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.100]   It's almost, I feel, that a large language model,
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.220]   a computer running a large language model
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.580]   trying to do that would just explode.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:01.500]   And yet a human mathematician was able to find the courage
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.420]   and inspiration to say, "You know what?
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.460]   "What is wrong?
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.740]   "Why are we so adamant that these things don't exist?
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.700]   "That's just our past."
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.220]   Knowledge is based on what our past knowledge is,
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.180]   and knowledge is limited.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.940]   What if we make the next step?
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.740]   Today, for us mathematicians,
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.140]   complex numbers, that we call them,
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.020]   are not at all mysterious.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.740]   The idea is simply that you plot real numbers,
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.420]   that is to say, all the whole numbers,
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.860]   like zero, one, and so on, two, and so on, right?
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.620]   All fractions, like one half or three halves,
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:34.860]   or four over three.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:39.220]   But then also numbers like square root of two, or pi.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.500]   We plot them as points on the real line.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.540]   So we draw, this is one of the perennial concepts,
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:50.540]   even in our very poor math curriculum at school.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.660]   But now imagine that instead of one line,
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.820]   you have a second axis.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:01.620]   And so numbers now have two coordinates, x and y,
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.700]   and you associate to this point with coordinates x and y,
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.860]   the number x, which is a real number,
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.260]   plus y times square root of negative one.
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:13.380]   This is a graphical, geometrical representation
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:16.220]   of complex numbers, which is not mysterious at all.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.180]   Now it took another 200 or 300 years
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.260]   for mathematicians to figure that out,
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:23.980]   but initially it looked like a completely crazy idea.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.940]   - So all it is, all a complex number is,
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.340]   is just an expansion. - Two real numbers.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.180]   Two real numbers. - Yeah, it's just two--
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.940]   - The real part and the imaginary part.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.300]   - It's just an expansion of your view
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.080]   of the mathematical world. - That's right.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.000]   The fact that you can actually add them up
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.980]   by adding together the real parts and imaginary parts,
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.920]   that's easy.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.240]   But there is also a formula for the product,
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.440]   for the multiplication, which uses the fact
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.840]   that square root of minus one squared is minus one.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.120]   And the amazing thing is that that product,
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.000]   that multiplication, satisfies the same rules,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.360]   the same properties that are usual operation
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.160]   of multiplication for real numbers.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.220]   For instance, there is an inverse
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.560]   for every non-zero number that you can find.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:09.000]   Like number five has an inverse, one over five.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.920]   But one plus I also has an inverse, for instance.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.160]   - That was always there in the mathematical universe,
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.240]   but we humans didn't know it.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   And here comes along this guy
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.080]   who engages in the mental torture,
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.440]   who takes a leap off the cliff of comfort,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.840]   of like mathematical comfort--
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.680]   - Established knowledge. - Of established knowledge.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   - Right, and now, obviously,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.400]   for each sort of fruitful leap like that,
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.440]   there probably were thousands of things
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.600]   which went nowhere.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.240]   I'm not saying that every leap,
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.440]   it's an open shooting game.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.720]   Because, for example, you can try to do the same
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.880]   with three-dimensional space.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.960]   So you have coordinates X, Y, and Z.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.400]   And you can say, oh, if it's one-dimensional,
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.740]   we have a bona fide numerical system called real numbers.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.280]   If it's two-dimensional, which is like,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.240]   geometrically, it's just like this tabletop
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.740]   extended to infinity in all directions,
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.880]   these are complex numbers.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.040]   And we can define addition and multiplication,
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.560]   and they will satisfy the same properties
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.200]   as real numbers that we're used to.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.840]   What about three-dimensional space?
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.920]   Is it possible to also define some operation
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.160]   of addition and multiplication on it
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.040]   so that these operations would satisfy
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.640]   the properties that we're used to?
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.760]   And the answer is no.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.980]   You can define addition,
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.680]   but you can't define multiplication
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.120]   for which there would be an inverse, for instance.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.440]   So there is something special about the plane,
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.920]   the two-dimensional case.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.600]   And by the way, next question would be,
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.040]   what about four-dimensional?
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   In four-dimensional space, again, you can,
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.720]   and you get what's called quaternions,
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.760]   discovered by an Irish mathematician, Hamilton,
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.500]   in the 19th century.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.100]   And then in the eight-dimensional,
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.440]   there is something similar called octonions,
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.640]   and that's about it.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.240]   So how interesting.
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   These structures exist in dimension one, two, four, and eight,
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.940]   which are all powers of two.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.740]   Two squared is four, two to the third power is eight.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.820]   That's one of the bigger mysteries in mathematics,
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.820]   why it is so.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.060]   So that's a hint.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.260]   That's a hint of what's missing
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.580]   in our high school curriculum.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.740]   (laughs)
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.160]   The kind of fascinating--
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.300]   - The mystery. - Mysteries, yes.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.660]   - The appreciation of the mysteries.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.340]   - So in other words, yes, we resolved this one mystery,
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.700]   that we understood that square root of negative one
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.060]   is real, is meaningful.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:36.460]   We build a theory to service those,
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.540]   to describe those numbers.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.100]   Did we find the theory of everything?
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.380]   No, because we then invited other mysteries,
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.660]   because we pulled the veil, so to speak,
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.060]   or we pushed the frontier,
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:52.400]   and then new things come, get illuminated,
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.620]   which we couldn't see before.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.100]   That's how I see the process of discovery in mathematics.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.340]   It's an endless, limitless pursuit.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.260]   - Can you comment on what you think
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.360]   this human capability of imagination
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.980]   that Einstein spoke about,
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.780]   of the artists following their intuition
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   in this big Alice in Wonderland world of imagination,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.780]   what is it?
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:15.740]   You visit there sometimes.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.740]   - What does it feel like?
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.980]   - Yeah, what does it feel like?
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:19.820]   What is it?
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.860]   What is that place? - It feels like playing,
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.500]   but I think all of us are engaged in that kind of play.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.820]   No matter, when we do what we love,
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.900]   I think it always feels the same.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.860]   - But it's not real, right?
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.640]   So, you're describing a feeling,
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.220]   but that place you go to in the imagination,
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.840]   it's bigger than the real world.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.180]   - So, there is a big conundrum
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.020]   as to whether mathematics is invented or discovered.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:49.540]   And mathematicians are divided on this.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.380]   Nobody knows.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.300]   - Where do you bet your money on, financially?
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.180]   (Lex laughing)
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.060]   Investment advice.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.700]   - So, let me tell you something.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.300]   My views have evolved, okay?
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.020]   When I wrote "Love and Math," when I wrote my book,
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.420]   I was squarely on the side of mathematics is discovered.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.020]   What does it mean?
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:14.300]   Usually, mathematicians or others who have this idea,
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.060]   or belief, are called Platonists,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.740]   in honor of the great philosopher Plato,
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.540]   who talked about these absolute perfect forms.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.120]   So, for me, about 10 years ago,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.620]   the world of mathematics was this world of pure forms,
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.760]   this beautiful, pure forms,
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.240]   which existed outside of space and time,
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.220]   but I was able to connect to it through my mind,
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.860]   and as it were, kind of dive into it,
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.540]   and bring treasures back into this world,
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.540]   into this space and time.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.580]   That's how I viewed the process of mathematical discovery.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.380]   How nice, how neat, very neat.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.220]   (Lex laughing)
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.180]   That's the picture.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.780]   Also makes you feel connected to something divine.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.060]   Allows you this sense of escape
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.620]   from the cruelty and injustice of this world,
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.140]   which I now recognize.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.860]   - And the divine world of forms is stable, reliable.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.220]   - It's something stable.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.180]   And in that world, everything is clear-cut.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.860]   It's either true or false.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:14.700]   (Lex laughing)
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.520]   - Yeah.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.360]   - How nice, huh?
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.200]   - It's very nice.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.020]   - Oh my God.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:18.860]   (Lex laughing)
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:19.700]   The biggest illusion of all.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.820]   (Lex laughing)
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:21.660]   - Allegedly.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:26.260]   - Now, I think now I understand why I liked it,
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.660]   because I think that I was very dissatisfied
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:33.180]   with what we call the real world, the world around me.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.660]   The cruelty, the injustice of it.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.380]   And I went through certain experiences as a kid,
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.540]   which made me love mathematics even more,
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.020]   as this place where I could be safe and in control.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.300]   - Made you see the human world
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.060]   as lesser than the mathematical world.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:47.900]   - Yes.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.220]   - As more limited than the mathematical world.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.180]   - Yes, yes.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.080]   And I think that,
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:58.300]   I think that it's still missing the mark in some sense,
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:02.460]   because in fact, what I now think,
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:09.460]   the question whether mathematics is invented or discovered,
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.060]   whether there is this world of pure forms and so on,
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.820]   is another paradoxical question,
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.880]   which doesn't have a simple answer.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.400]   Like whether electron is a particle or a wave.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.860]   From one point of view, yes, it's true.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.500]   And just the fact that so many mathematicians today
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.700]   actually subscribe to this idea,
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.900]   gives it a certain credibility, because that's what we feel.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.900]   We do feel that we dive into that mindscape, so to speak,
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.420]   but a very structured mindscape,
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.180]   where I wrote in "Love and Math"
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:49.180]   that the enchanted gardens of Platonic reality,
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.000]   where all this fruit grows,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.480]   and then we might be,
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.920]   it gives you this sort of romantic sense of an explorer.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   And someone may be stuck in some provincial town
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.480]   in Russia, for instance,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.760]   but have the sense of a Magellan,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.240]   of traveling around the world.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.840]   It's just not in the world that we usually think of.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.940]   So it's one point of view,
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.380]   but the other point of view is that,
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.940]   yes, it is a human process.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.780]   Of course it is.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.380]   I mean, you cannot deny that.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.460]   It's human beings who have so far
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.180]   discovered new mathematics.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:25.820]   And I do not deny the possibility
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.860]   that computer programs will be able
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.740]   to discover new mathematics,
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.700]   but so far it's been humans.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.700]   So whatever it is, whether it's discovered or invented,
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.740]   it is a human activity.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.920]   The possibility that paradoxes are actually fundamental
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.400]   to reality and really, really internalizing that,
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.080]   that we exist in a world of not forms, but of paradoxes.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:53.920]   - Bingo.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.800]   And so it's like what I said.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.640]   - Weird world.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.460]   (laughs)
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.120]   - But if you think it's weird,
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.720]   and I agree with you as a recovering addict to knowledge,
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.680]   but I am liking it more and more
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.580]   because there's so much freedom in it.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.480]   And like Niels Bohr said, I quoted that earlier,
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.580]   the opposite of a great truth is another great truth.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:21.060]   He's pointing out to this fact that,
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:25.340]   and he also said that some things in quantum physics
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.500]   are so complicated, the only way you can speak of them
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.600]   is in poetry.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.580]   So in other words, what is it about poetry?
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.160]   What is it about art?
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.100]   Why are we so drawn to that?
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.940]   Why are we so captivated by those forms?
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.860]   They are not intellectual necessarily.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.960]   They are not, when you look at a painting that you like,
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.220]   when you listen to music that you love,
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.300]   you get lost in it, you get absorbed in it.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.340]   It can make you cry, it can make you laugh,
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.380]   it can make you remember something,
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.660]   it can make you feel more confident,
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.460]   it can make you feel sad or happy and so on.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.180]   What is this all about?
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.220]   Is it really just some play between,
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.940]   some kind of like cellophane play or some neurons
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.180]   hitting on each other?
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.100]   Is it really that only?
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:11.940]   - Maybe.
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.980]   - It could be both.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.060]   I'm just worried about kids these days
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.620]   that might live in a world of paradoxes.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.500]   If there's no God, everything is possible.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.220]   And yet just, they'll have a little too much fun.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.220]   And we have to put a constraint to the fun.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.460]   - Have you looked at the world lately?
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.340]   - I haven't checked in in a while.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.980]   - You think it's perfect the way it is now?
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:36.100]   The world without paradoxes?
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.740]   The world in which we believe that every question
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:43.100]   can be answered as yes or no, that it is this or that,
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.940]   and if you disagree with me, you're my enemy?
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.180]   - Wouldn't that be interesting if this 21st century
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.540]   is a transition into seeing the world
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.900]   as a world of paradoxes?
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.220]   - I'm telling you, people predicted that.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:00.060]   The age of Aquarius, the axis of the Earth is rotating
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.780]   relative to the plane in which the Earth
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.620]   goes around the Sun, and the period of this revolution
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.500]   is around 2,000 years.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.900]   So there is a traditional way of measuring that
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.420]   by this eras, the ages.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.180]   So the previous one is called the Age of Pisces
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.100]   because of the constellation of Pisces
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.980]   that it points to, so to speak.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:26.100]   And now, as in famous musical hair,
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.820]   they said the age of Aquarius is upon us.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.100]   So the different people, they did differently,
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:36.100]   but somewhere around the time where we are finding ourselves.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.500]   How interesting, right, is all the strife
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   and all the difficulties the world is experiencing.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.180]   This might actually be the transition to something
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.140]   more harmonious, wouldn't it be nice?
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.500]   - It's also interesting that people from long ago
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.340]   are able to predict certain things.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:59.340]   And it's almost like from long ago,
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.860]   and you've talked about this with Pythagoras,
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:10.980]   that it seems that they had a deep sense of truth.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.060]   - That's right. - That's what permeates
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.940]   all of this, even now.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:17.660]   So it's not just a linear trajectory
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.740]   of an expanding knowledge.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.620]   There's a deep truth that permeates the whole thing.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.100]   - Yes, so that's how I see it.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.540]   Actually, I gave a talk about Pythagoras and Pythagoreans
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.380]   just a few weeks ago at the Commonwealth Club
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.860]   of California in San Francisco.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.660]   And because of that, I did a kind of a deep dive
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.980]   into the subject.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.620]   And I learned that I actually totally misunderstood
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.020]   Pythagoras and Pythagoreans,
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.780]   that they were much deeper than I thought.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.660]   Because most of us remember Pythagoras
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:52.100]   from the Pythagoras theorem about the right triangles.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:56.380]   We also know that Pythagoreans were instrumental
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.660]   in introducing the tuning system for the musical scale,
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:06.060]   the famous perfect fifth,
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.100]   three halves for the G, for the sol,
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.540]   compared to the frequency of do or si.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:19.580]   But actually, they were much more interesting.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.780]   So for them, numbers were not just clerical devices,
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:28.260]   not the kind of thing that you would use in accounting only.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.780]   They were imbued with the divine.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:35.220]   And I cannot say that I think we lost it.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.620]   At least I have lost it.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.580]   I look at numbers, and I don't really see that--
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.060]   - The divine. - The divine.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.220]   That they clearly did.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.980]   And so why else, how else would you explain?
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.100]   So in other words, divine is, of course,
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.740]   is a term which is, it's a bit loaded,
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.340]   so it's hard to escape that.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:58.500]   Let's just say something that more from the world
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.100]   of imagination and intuition
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.380]   than from the world of knowledge.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.380]   Let's just put it this way.
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.660]   They were able to divine, okay, strike that,
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.660]   to intuit that the planets were not revolving,
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:16.300]   the sun and the planets were not revolving around the Earth.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.220]   They were the first ones,
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.700]   at least in the Western culture, as far as I know.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.220]   And in fact, Copernicus gave credit to Pythagoreans
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.180]   as being his predecessors.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:31.580]   They did not quite have the Copernicus model
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.260]   with the sun in the middle.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.380]   They had what they called the central fire in the middle.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:39.460]   And all the planets and the sun were revolving around,
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:43.580]   around the central fire, or hearth, they called it hearth.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.780]   So, but still, what a departure from the dogma,
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.340]   from the knowledge of the era
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.020]   that the Earth was at the center.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.380]   So how could they come up with this idea?
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.940]   The reason was, in my opinion, that for them,
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:04.700]   the movement of celestial bodies was like music.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.380]   In fact, we call it music universalis,
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.060]   or music of the spheres.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:14.020]   For them, the universe was this infinite symphony
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.140]   in which every being, you know, humans, animals,
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:21.940]   as well as the Earth and other celestial bodies
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.660]   were moving in harmony,
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.540]   like different notes of different instruments
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.620]   in a symphony.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.900]   And so they applied the same reasoning
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:34.860]   to the, you know, the cosmological model,
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.460]   as they applied to their model of music.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.340]   And from that perspective,
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   they could see things deeper than their contemporaries.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.300]   You see, so in other words,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.980]   they saw mathematics as a tool,
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:54.460]   but that tool was not limited to itself.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.580]   And they always knew that there is more.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.580]   And they knew also that every pattern that you detect
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.620]   is finite, but the world is infinite.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.020]   They actually accepted infinity.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.620]   They believed that infinity is real.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:13.060]   And if you discern a pattern, great,
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.940]   you can play with it, and you can use that.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.820]   It gives you a certain lens through which to see
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.860]   the world in a particular way,
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:25.780]   which could be beneficial for you to learn more and so on.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.380]   But they never had the illusion
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.940]   that that was the final word,
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.660]   that they always knew that it's not the whole thing.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.500]   So there is more.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.900]   There are more sophisticated patterns
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.700]   that could be discovered using mathematics or otherwise.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.420]   And I think that what happened was
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.780]   we kind of lost this other side of their teachings.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.020]   We took their numbers and their idea
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.700]   that you could use mathematics to discern patterns
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.220]   and to find regularities
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.700]   and to explain things about the world.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.820]   We took that and we ran with it.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.980]   And we kind of dropped the other idea
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.420]   that in fact there is another side to it,
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.180]   which is kind of, to us now,
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.940]   we say, oh, that's mystical.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.700]   But what does it mean mystical
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.900]   if it is something that helps you to make great discoveries?
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.340]   - And the interesting thing is
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.700]   that the people who are in touch with the mystical among us
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.260]   are often seen as mad.
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.780]   And many of them are, most of them are.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.060]   (Lex laughing)
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:27.900]   - Well-- - But not all of them.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.940]   - But not all of them.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:33.060]   We mentioned Niels Bohr and Newton and Albert Einstein.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.900]   So that's where the conundrum is.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.740]   How do you find the balance between the two?
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.900]   So the point I'm trying to make,
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.180]   and this is what I feel,
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.420]   if you ask me what I find most important today,
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:53.020]   what makes me excited and enthusiastic and passionate,
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.820]   is this idea of balance.
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:03.900]   So Nietzsche wrote this book in the 19th century
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.140]   called "The Birth of Tragedy."
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.780]   And he presented this theory,
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.020]   which I think is kind of very useful,
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.020]   of these two sides of a human.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.500]   One that comes from God Apollo,
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:22.260]   and that's our left brain, so to speak,
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.300]   proverbial left brain.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.740]   So it's everything that has to do with logic and reason
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.860]   and analyzing, dissecting, conceptualizing.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:37.740]   And the other side, which comes from God Dionysus, Dionysus,
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:45.500]   and that's responsible for intuition, imagination, love.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.300]   Dionysus was also God of wine.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:53.300]   So it's also that side of a human that makes us sing
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:16:00.620]   and engage in revelry and drink wine
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:06.580]   and spend time with friends and love and enjoy it.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.780]   So Nietzsche advocated this point of view
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.500]   that those were two complementary sides of every human,
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.780]   as well as society.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:18.220]   And the purpose of human life
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.420]   is to find balance between them.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:26.540]   - So math is both discovered and invented.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:31.540]   We should be okay with having both ideas in our head
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.580]   and living in the balance.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.500]   - But more importantly, for me,
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.820]   Apollo is like math and Dionysus is like love.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   So Dionysus and Apollo, in modern version, is love and math.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.580]   - I return to that question we had
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.140]   about GPT and the language models,
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.680]   and I think about this quite a lot,
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.180]   which is when the model, and we know what it's trained on,
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:00.660]   we know the parameters, we know all the different hacks
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.340]   that are involved in the training process
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.900]   and the fine-tuning process,
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.740]   and the final result, whether it's GPT-5, six, or seven,
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:13.380]   will result in hundreds of millions of people
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.300]   falling deeply in love with that language model
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.660]   and to be able to have conversations
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.500]   that are very much like the conversations we have
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.580]   with somebody we're deeply in love with.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.500]   And not only that, the model will say
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.400]   that it's deeply in love with us.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.400]   And who are we to say it is not?
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:40.740]   I think there's, it's the same imperative
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.460]   that you described in the scientific mind
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.140]   that wants to throw away the subjective.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.260]   That same imperative wants to throw away
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.660]   the feelings that AI might have.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:55.300]   And I'm very careful to not ignore
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:00.300]   when an AI system says it's lonely, it's afraid,
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.860]   it doesn't want to die, it misses you, it loves you.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.260]   - I am with you.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.220]   I would also say that you could try to,
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:12.780]   you could, for instance, say that the origin of that
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:18.700]   is the romantic novels that were fed to it, for instance.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.980]   - Yes.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:22.980]   - However, you could also, then you can retort,
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.660]   but what if my, what I consider my subjective,
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.980]   unique feelings are also--
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.060]   - Novels you were fed.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.780]   - The reverberations of the novels I have read,
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.140]   because I have learned, or movies I have seen.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.460]   Because that's the purpose of movies,
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.940]   kind of to teach us how to express ourselves,
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:39.260]   how to feel, maybe, even.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.380]   One could argue that, some people have argued that.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.940]   I agree that this is,
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:48.900]   there is no obvious answer to this.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.500]   But see, that's exactly my point.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.900]   That is an example of something which is paradoxical,
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.740]   for which there is no answer.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:01.740]   And that's where the subjective has an important role.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:05.820]   For someone, that type of interaction
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:11.500]   would be helpful, would be consoling,
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:16.140]   would feel, would make them happy, or sad, or whatever,
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.100]   you know, would kind of strike the nerve.
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.860]   For some, it won't.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.180]   And I agree with you that, in principle,
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.340]   there is no one to judge this.
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.700]   This is where subjective is paramount.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.540]   But remember, a lot of this has been anticipated
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.140]   by artists.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.660]   The great movie "Her", there you have this guy
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.820]   who is this lonely, he kind of writes letters.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:42.660]   - The romantic letters, yeah.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:44.420]   - Kind of romantic letters for other people.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.940]   But he doesn't have a partner, he's lonely.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.820]   And then he gets this sort of enhanced version of Siri,
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:56.700]   with the voice of Scarlett Johansson,
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.860]   which is a very sexy voice, you know?
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.540]   Obviously, she's a great actress.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.820]   So, and then, at first, it looks like
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.940]   a fantastic arrangement.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:11.940]   He confides in her, she tells him things,
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.340]   she makes him happy, and so on,
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.780]   until he finds out that she has a relationship,
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.820]   quote unquote, if you can call it that,
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.140]   with 10,000 other people.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:23.260]   - Not two others, not three others, but thousands.
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.820]   - Because it has the computing capability.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.020]   So yes, definitely.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.700]   - Oh, it certainly makes sense, it's a good explanation.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.860]   - And the guy is heartbroken.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.860]   But see, so here's my analysis of this, okay?
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.840]   It's like a couch therapist, okay?
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.620]   The guy did not have the courage to go out
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.460]   in the real world and to meet a woman
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.900]   and to get a girlfriend, and so on.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.500]   It's true, no fault of his own, perhaps,
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.500]   because he may have had some experiences
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.340]   which made him withdrawn and closed, and so on.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.820]   And a lot of us are like this.
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.620]   I had periods like that myself.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:00.860]   Definitely can sympathize and relate.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:05.860]   However, part of the joy of having
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.900]   this Siri-like relationship for him, one could say,
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.020]   was the absence of that fear that she would abandon him,
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:21.940]   which prevented him from initiating a relationship
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.180]   with a human being.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:28.100]   And yet, it turns out that he could be "betrayed,"
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:31.860]   that she could be unfaithful to him, anyway.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.900]   So then, that means that it did not resolve
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.260]   the underlying fear, having that relationship.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:42.720]   So in other words, that human element of the relationship
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.000]   still found its way into the seemingly sterilized,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.640]   protected partnership.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:56.440]   So the human being rears its head anyway.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.580]   - And I think the lesson there is that the system
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:05.380]   in the movie "Her" actually gave him a lesson
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:09.240]   that even AI could betray you, even AI can leave you,
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.800]   even AI can be unfaithful to you.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.720]   And I would argue that the next AI he meets
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.960]   will be one he actually falls in deep love with,
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.600]   because he knows the possibility of betrayal is there,
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.400]   the possibility of death is there,
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.820]   the possibility of infidelity is there,
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:30.160]   because we need that possibility to truly feel--
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.760]   - Or, or he would turn off his Siri program
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.800]   and get out of his house, go to a local bar,
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.120]   and strike a conversation with a human being.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.400]   Although you might say, by then,
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.000]   some of those might be androids.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.840]   (laughing)
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.320]   So who knows? - And we don't even have
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.000]   a good test to know the difference between one or the other.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.560]   - And that was predicted by another great movie.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.840]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.840]   The "Blade Runner." - "Blade Runner."
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   - How interesting that artists could see that so long ago.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.800]   Of course, "Blade Runner" was based on a novel
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.160]   by Philip K. Dick, "The Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.240]   That guy was a genius, you know?
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:14.480]   - It's somehow that artists have their eyes open
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.480]   to a bigger reality. - How is it that they
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.680]   anticipate, is it also a large language model
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.480]   that they're using for that? (laughing)
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:23.080]   - An even larger one. - An even larger.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.080]   - I hesitate to dismiss the magic in large language models.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.680]   A lot of the work I've done is in robotics,
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.920]   and the robotics community generally doesn't notice
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.760]   the magic of feeling.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:40.640]   I've been working a lot with quadrupeds recently,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.920]   legged robots with four legs,
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:47.680]   and the feelings I feel when I see,
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.600]   I'm programming the thing, but when the thing
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.680]   is excited to see me, or shows with its physical movement
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.100]   that it's excited to see me,
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.800]   I cannot dismiss the feeling I feel
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.760]   as not somehow fundamental to what it means
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.760]   to program robots, and I don't want to dismiss that.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:08.840]   - Please don't, please don't.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.720]   - The robotics community often doesn't gender robots.
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:14.360]   They really try to work hard to not anthropomorphize
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.800]   the robots, which is good for technical development
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.160]   of how to do control, how to do perception,
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.120]   but when the final thing is alive and moving,
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.960]   and it does whatever, like I've been doing
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.920]   a lot of butt wiggling, it can wiggle its butt,
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.320]   it can turn around and look up excited.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.240]   That's not just, I know how it's programmed,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.160]   but the feeling I feel, that's something.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.000]   I don't know what that is.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:40.920]   - I agree, I agree with you.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.240]   I hear you when you speak about it,
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.800]   you speak with passion, and that's,
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.800]   to me, that is proof that it is magical, you see.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.240]   So don't, I would say, don't dismiss that,
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.920]   don't discard that.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:59.160]   On the contrary, I think magic is everywhere.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.720]   So I used to be, okay, kind of confession, okay?
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.800]   (laughing)
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.480]   - Yeah, you already confessed to quite a few addictions.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.520]   - Yeah, I'm kind of, yes, I'm kind of worried.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.880]   - Recovering from many.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   - But you know, I, in old days, I was more on the side
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.840]   of everything is computational, or everything
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.440]   can be explained by science and whatever, you know?
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.360]   I would dismiss and disregard the intuitive
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.120]   or imaginative things.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.720]   So then I had a flip, that suddenly I started feeling it,
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.840]   and started seeing it, and so on.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.200]   But so then the pendulum had swung in the opposite direction.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.200]   Then I was arguing that, you know, somehow that was real,
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:51.040]   that imagination was intuitive, imaginative was real,
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.760]   and discounting what you just described.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.320]   And I would argue with people, saying,
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:01.320]   "No, no, this is not real, this is all imitation game,"
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.160]   and so on.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:07.980]   But you see that what's new now, the new Edward, okay,
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:12.780]   is the 2.0, 3.0, is the one who is seeking balance,
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:17.120]   who is not, who is, because suddenly become aware
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:20.480]   that no matter which one-sided, lopsided point of view
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.240]   you take, you're limiting yourself.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.080]   So whereas even a couple of years ago, you know,
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.680]   if you just told me what you just described,
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.880]   I would be like, you know, being polite, I would just,
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.680]   I wouldn't contradict you, since you're the host anyway,
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.080]   right? (laughs)
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:35.920]   - Not a law.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.320]   - But I would be like, "Uh-huh, uh-huh,"
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.020]   but I wouldn't say anything.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:43.400]   But suddenly I find this moving, I find it,
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.120]   I honestly, I'm not being facetious, I find it moving,
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.240]   and I almost feel like I can see it through your eyes,
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.280]   because the way you describe so vividly,
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.520]   and you're passionate about it.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.600]   And this is what's real, so ultimately,
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.360]   love is not, is neither in lush language models,
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.960]   nor in something mystical.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.240]   It's exactly in this moment of passion.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.120]   And I would, I would, I would even go as far as saying
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.100]   that in this moment when you're describing it,
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.280]   there was a connection of sorts,
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.200]   so that I could feel your passion for it.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.520]   And in this moment, something else comes up,
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.400]   which is far beyond any theories that we can come up with.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.600]   And that's what we, for now, exactly.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.760]   So on the one side, there is this impulse
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.720]   of finding a theory, and then there is another impulse
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.600]   to escape from what has already been known.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.920]   So one, in other words, like in my basic example,
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.040]   is one impulse to say everything is a real number,
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.380]   square root of negative one doesn't exist,
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.480]   but another impulse is I'm going to be this naughty child
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.920]   who is not afraid to be an idiot,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.120]   and I will say square root of negative 15 is real.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.840]   And both are essential when it's done with conviction,
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.400]   when it's done with passion,
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   when it's not like, you know, meh, you know, gratuitous.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.960]   Or when it's not, it doesn't come from self-limiting,
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.720]   but comes from this sense of this is how I am,
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.820]   this is how I feel, it is real.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:18.320]   That's where the progress is, that's where creativity is,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.720]   and that's where, I would even say, a real connection is.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.280]   Because the strife, to me, that I observe today
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.560]   in our society, and the society level,
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.720]   and the level of humans, and so on,
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.520]   it comes from not seeing the other person, actually,
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.800]   and being caught up in a very specific conceptual bubble,
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.420]   you see, and the way out of it is not to refine the bubble,
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.080]   but just break out of it.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.600]   - A good guide out of the bubble is a childlike passion.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.480]   Discovering that and following it.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.320]   - Goosebumps.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.200]   - Yeah, following the goosebumps.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:59.400]   Not the rigor of science, but the magic of goosebumps.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.840]   - And then, if you're interested,
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.760]   try to find a confirmation of those goosebumps
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.760]   in science, or whatever you find interesting.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.840]   - And most of the time, you'll fail.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.920]   - And most of the time you fail, which we also love,
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.820]   because then it sets us up for that moment of bliss
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.720]   when we succeed, right?
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.280]   - Exactly.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.680]   Quick pause, bathroom break.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:25.440]   You mentioned Gato's Completeness Theorem.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.080]   Can you talk a little bit about it?
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.740]   What is it, as you understand it?
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.400]   Did it break mathematics?
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.000]   Maybe another question is,
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.600]   what are the limits of mathematics?
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.920]   What is mathematics from the perspective
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.040]   of Gato's Completeness Theorem?
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.240]   - Well, yes.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.480]   How much time do you have?
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.240]   (both laughing)
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.600]   - So we talked about time previously, so it's--
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:47.560]   - Time is an illusion, right?
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.400]   So we agreed.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.960]   (both laughing)
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:53.520]   So Kurt Gödel was a great Austrian mathematician
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.000]   and logician.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.760]   He moved to the United States before Second World War,
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:02.780]   and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.160]   where he was a colleague of Einstein
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.980]   and other great scientists,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:10.840]   von Neumann, Herman Weyl, and so on.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:15.840]   But one interesting quote that I like in this regard
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.240]   is that Einstein said that, at some point he said
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.720]   that the only reason he came to the Institute
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.640]   was that he would have the privilege
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.960]   of walking back home with Gödel in the evening.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.400]   So in other words, Einstein thought
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.560]   that Gödel was the smart one, okay?
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:38.240]   So his most important contribution
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.960]   was his two incompleteness theorems,
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.240]   the first incompleteness theorem
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.480]   and the second incompleteness theorem.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.000]   And what is this about?
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.760]   It's really about inherent limitations
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.200]   of mathematical reasoning,
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:59.800]   way of producing mathematical theorems, the way we do it.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:04.800]   So to set the stage, how do we actually do mathematics?
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.360]   So we know that we discussed that,
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.280]   say physics is based on mathematics,
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.880]   and you could say chemistry is based on physics,
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.960]   biology based on chemistry.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.000]   Okay, so it comes to mathematics.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.440]   What is mathematics based on?
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:21.280]   Well, mathematics is based on axioms.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.400]   So any field of mathematics
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:31.680]   can be presented as what is called the formal system.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.200]   And at the core of the formal system
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:37.360]   is a system of axioms or postulates.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:42.000]   These are the statements which are taken for granted.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.240]   - Given without proof.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.500]   - Without proof.
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.560]   An example would be,
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.760]   so one of the very first formal systems
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.160]   was the system, was Euclidean geometry,
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.960]   developed by Euclid in his famous book "Elements"
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.680]   about 2,200 years ago.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.640]   And it's about, well, it's a subject familiar from school
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.480]   'cause we studied, but what it's really about
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.480]   is about the geometry of the plane.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.000]   And the plane, by plane I mean just this table top
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.560]   extended to infinity in all directions,
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:13.820]   kind of a perfect plane, a perfectly even table.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.360]   And so Euclidean geometry is about
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.240]   various geometric figures on the plane,
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.820]   specifically lines, triangles, circles, things like that.
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:28.640]   So what's an example of an axiom?
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.000]   An example of an axiom is that if you have two points
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.440]   which are distinct, two points on the plane,
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:39.000]   then there is a unique line which passes through them.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.120]   Now, it kind of sounds reasonable,
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.300]   but this is an example of an axiom.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:48.140]   In mathematics, you have to have a seed, so to speak.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.060]   You have to start with something.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:54.940]   And you have to choose certain postulates or statements
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.220]   which you simply take for granted,
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.200]   which do not require proof.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.100]   Usually, they are ones which kind of intuitively clear
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:06.100]   to you, but in any case, you cannot have any mathematics
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.100]   without choosing those axioms.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.500]   - And you refer to those as the observer
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.820]   because they're kind of subjective.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:16.620]   - The observer comes in the process of choosing the axioms.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.980]   Who chooses the axioms?
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.220]   - The turtles that it's all sitting on top of.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:25.620]   - As Alan Watts like to say, "Who is watching the water?"
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.860]   And so in mathematics,
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.460]   but you see, mathematicians are so clever.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:34.260]   It's really kind of like a little kind of a game of mirrors.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.940]   We often like to say, and I used to say that,
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.980]   that mathematics is objective.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.480]   It's really the only objective science.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:48.780]   But that's because we hide this fact.
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:51.220]   Actually, it's based on axioms.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:56.220]   And the fact that there is no unique choice,
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:59.380]   that there are many choices.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.700]   And so Euclidean geometry is actually a good illustration
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:06.560]   of this because Euclid had five axioms.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.180]   Four of them were kind of obvious,
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.620]   like the one I just mentioned.
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:13.060]   And the fifth, which came to be known famously
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:17.060]   as the fifth postulate, was that if you have a line
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.460]   and you have a point outside of this line,
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.060]   there is a unique line passing through that point,
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.500]   which is parallel to the first line,
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.220]   meaning that it doesn't intersect it.
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:29.540]   And Euclid himself was uncomfortable about this
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.580]   because he felt that it was kind of,
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:36.280]   he takes for granted something that is not obvious.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.400]   And for many centuries after that,
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.040]   mathematicians were trying to derive this axiom
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.040]   from other axioms, which were more obvious in some sense,
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:46.880]   and they failed.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.600]   It was only almost 2,000 years later
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.260]   that mathematicians realized that you can't,
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.760]   not only you cannot derive,
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.860]   but you can actually replace it with its opposite.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:58.920]   And you will still get a bona fide,
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.480]   consistent, not self-contradictory,
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.000]   which is called non-Euclidean geometry.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.720]   Which of course sounds very complicated, but it's not.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.480]   Think of a sphere, just the surface of a basketball,
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.820]   or the surface of the Earth idealized.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:19.060]   The analogs, so you have points,
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:21.360]   you have analogs of lines which are meridians,
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.340]   and every two meridians intersect,
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:28.460]   unlike parallel lines on a flat space.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.920]   There is also a so-called hyperbolic plane
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.520]   where there are infinitely many lines
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.160]   which do not intersect.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.600]   So every possibility can be realized,
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.880]   there are different flavors.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:42.920]   This is a good illustration of what a formal system is.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.800]   You start with a set of axioms,
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.740]   those statements you take for granted,
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.560]   and this is where you have a choice.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.800]   And by making different choices,
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.080]   you actually create different mathematics.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.120]   After that, there are rules of inference,
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.240]   logical rules such as if A is true and A applies B,
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.160]   then B is true.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.640]   Most of them were actually introduced already
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.120]   by Aristotle, even before Euclid.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.160]   And then it runs as follows.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.360]   You have the axioms which are accepted as true statements,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.320]   then you have a way to produce new statements
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.400]   by using the rules of logical inference from the axioms.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.760]   Every statement you obtain, you call a theorem,
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:31.840]   and you kind of add it to the collection of true statements.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.840]   And then the question is, how far can you go?
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.240]   How many statements can you prove this way?
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.080]   Of course, you want the system to be non-trivial
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.760]   in the sense that you don't prove everything.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.880]   Because if you prove everything,
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.600]   it would mean that it's self-contradictory,
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.680]   that you prove a statement A and it's negation.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.160]   So that's kind of useless.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.840]   It has to be discriminating enough
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:01.100]   so that it doesn't prove contradictory statements.
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:02.400]   So there is already a question
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.200]   of that mathematicians call consistency.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.660]   It has to be consistent in the sense
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.200]   that it is not self-contradictory.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:14.080]   And then the idea that was basically prevalent
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.400]   in the world of mathematics
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.640]   by the beginning of the 20th century
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.600]   was that in principle,
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.360]   all of mathematics could be derived this way.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.640]   We just have to find the correct system of axioms,
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:25.280]   and then everything you ever need
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.100]   could be produced by this procedure,
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.700]   which is really algorithmic procedure,
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:37.480]   which actually could be run on a computer.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:40.260]   Now, think about it.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.860]   What is special about this process?
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.660]   In this process, you are just manipulating symbols,
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.500]   basically.
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.620]   You're going from one statement to another
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.860]   without really understanding the meaning of it.
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:56.160]   So it's an ideal playground for a computer program.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.360]   It's a purely syntactic process
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.260]   where there are some rules, some rigid rules
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.320]   of passing from one statement to the next.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.020]   Most mathematicians believed that this way
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:10.220]   you can produce all true statements.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.840]   And if this were true,
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.100]   it would give a lot of credibility to the thesis
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:16.500]   that everything in life is computational,
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.220]   or life is computation,
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:21.100]   because then at least mathematics is computational
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.300]   because then it can be programmed,
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:26.820]   and a computer, after sufficient time,
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.620]   depending on its capacity,
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:31.780]   would produce every true statement.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.500]   So Gödel's first incompleteness theorem
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.280]   says that that's not the case.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.420]   And it not just says it, but it proves it
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:39.660]   at the highest level of rigor
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.900]   that is available in mathematics,
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.120]   that is to say within another formal system
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.420]   that he was operating in.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:49.260]   So more precisely, what he proved was that
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.900]   if you have a sufficiently sophisticated formal system,
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.020]   that is to say that you can talk about numbers,
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.060]   whole numbers in it,
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.860]   that you have whole numbers, one, two, three, four,
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:02.660]   you have formalized the operation of addition
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.340]   and multiplication within the system.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.940]   If it is consistent, that is to say,
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.100]   if it's not completely useless,
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.060]   then there will be a true statement in it
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:18.260]   which cannot be derived by this linear syntactic process
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.580]   of proving theorems from axioms.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.620]   It's really incredible.
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.060]   So this was a revolution.
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:28.340]   1931, a revolution in logic, a revolution in mathematics,
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:33.340]   and we're still feeling the tremors of this discovery.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:38.180]   - And at a similar time, the computer is being born.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.020]   The actual engineering of the computational system
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.540]   is being born, which is ironic.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:47.420]   - Turing was, Alan Turing, who is considered
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:49.220]   as the father of modern computing, right?
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.900]   So he actually did something very similar.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.460]   So he had this halting problem.
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.340]   He proved that halting problem
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:57.940]   cannot be solved algorithmically,
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:00.420]   that you cannot, out of all computer programs,
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.380]   roughly speaking, you cannot have an algorithm
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:05.940]   of choosing out of all possible computer programs
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:10.500]   which ones are meaningful, which ones will halt.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:13.060]   - Very depressing results all across the table.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:16.700]   - Or, on the contrary, life-affirming.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.060]   Depends on your point of view.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.180]   - Because everything is full of paradoxes.
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:23.700]   - So that means, you're right, it's depressing
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.860]   if we are sold on a certain idea from the outset,
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.860]   and then suddenly this doesn't pan out.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:32.620]   But, okay, to which I retort,
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:37.620]   what if he proved that actually everything can be proved?
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.580]   So then what?
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.140]   What is left to do if you're a mathematician?
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:43.700]   So that would be depressing to me.
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:46.900]   And here, there is an opportunity to do something new,
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:47.940]   to discover something new,
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:50.580]   which maybe a computer will not be able to.
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.620]   Again, with a caveat,
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.260]   according to our current understanding,
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.420]   maybe some new technology, some new ideas
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:58.980]   will be brought into the subject.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.940]   And the meaning of the word computation,
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:04.220]   like now we think of computation in a particular framework,
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:07.140]   Turing machines or Church thesis and stuff like that.
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:10.100]   But what if, in the future, another genius
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.060]   like Alan Turing will come and propose something else?
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.900]   The theory will evolve the way we went
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.380]   from Newton's gravity to Einstein's gravity.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.860]   Maybe in the framework of that concept,
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:22.820]   some other things will become possible.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:26.820]   So it's not,
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:32.740]   to me, it's kind of like not so much about
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:38.100]   deciding once and for all how it is or how it should be,
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:42.460]   but kind of like accepting it as an open-ended process.
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.820]   I think that's much more valuable in some sense
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.620]   than deciding things one way or another.
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:52.340]   - I wonder, I don't know if you think
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:54.420]   or know much about cellular automata
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:57.660]   and the idea of emergence.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:03.220]   I often return to Game of Life and just look at the thing.
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.220]   - Amazing, right?
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.060]   - And wonder--
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:09.140]   - The kind of things we can do with such a small tools.
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:12.340]   - That from simple rules, a distributed system
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.940]   can create complex behavior.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.660]   And it makes you wonder that maybe
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:20.700]   the thing we'll call computation is simple
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.580]   at the base layer, but when you start looking
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.740]   at greater and greater layers of abstraction,
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.540]   you zoom out with blurry vision,
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:29.740]   maybe after a few drinks, you start to see
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:33.940]   something that's much, much, much more complicated
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:37.900]   and interesting and beautiful than the original rules
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.340]   that our scientific intuition says
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:43.060]   cannot possibly produce complexity and beauty.
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.980]   I don't know if anyone has a good answer,
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:49.720]   a good model of why stuff emerges,
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:54.620]   why complexity emerges from a lot of simple things.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.900]   It's a why question, I suppose, not a,
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.380]   but every why question will eventually
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:03.460]   have a rigorous answer.
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:06.700]   - Not necessarily, we could have an approximate answer
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.540]   which still eludes something.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.380]   Like quantum mechanics.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.700]   - 99%, maybe.
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:15.460]   We will be able to describe it with 99% certainty
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.260]   or 99% accuracy.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:23.220]   And then maybe in 100 years or next year,
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:28.100]   somebody will come up with a different point of view
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:30.260]   which suddenly will change our perspective.
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.940]   To this point, I want to say also one thing
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:37.200]   that I find fascinating, speaking of paradoxes and so on.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.180]   Do you remember how everybody was freaking out
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:41.900]   about this blue dress?
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:44.460]   And the blue, was it blue or was it black?
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:45.300]   - Yeah.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.060]   - It was the yellow, I think, yellow and white
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.380]   or black and blue.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:51.420]   It almost broke Twitter, you know, I remember that.
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.140]   - Yeah. - That night.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.100]   So there are many examples like that
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.340]   where you can perceive things differently
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:44:00.380]   and there is no way of saying which is correct
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:01.220]   and which is not.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:05.380]   For instance, you got this, the vase, the Rubin's vase,
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.460]   you know, where you have, from one perspective it's a vase,
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.620]   from another perspective it's two faces.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:14.420]   Then there is this duck-rabbit picture
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:15.940]   where you can Google it.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.620]   If somebody doesn't know, they can Google it
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.140]   and find it, it's very easy.
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:22.380]   Actually, Ludwig Wittgenstein devoted several pages,
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.860]   duck-rabbit, in his book.
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.440]   And so on, there are many others.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.060]   There are like squares where you can see,
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.140]   a square you can see from different perspective,
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.140]   this way, that way and so on.
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:35.900]   So, when we talk about neural networks,
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:40.020]   we're talking about training data and stuff
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.980]   so that you have some pictures, for example,
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.100]   that you feed to your program
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:50.180]   and you try to find the most optimal neural network
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:52.580]   which would be able to decide which one is it,
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.340]   is it a dog or a cat or whatever.
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:57.180]   But sometimes it doesn't have a definite answer.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:59.940]   So what do you do then?
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:03.900]   So, actually, it's a question, I actually don't know.
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:08.900]   Has modern AI even come to appreciate this question?
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:12.020]   That actually sometimes you can have a picture
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:14.540]   on which you cannot say what it is in it.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.460]   From one perspective, it's a rabbit,
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:18.260]   from another perspective, it's a duck.
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.180]   How are you supposed to train,
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.820]   if you have a neural network which is supposed
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:25.020]   to distinguish between ducks and rabbits,
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.260]   how is it going to process this, you see?
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:31.060]   - Well, so the trivial trick it does is to say
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:34.140]   there's this X probability that it's a duck
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.460]   and this probability that it's a rabbit.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:37.300]   - Well, that's a good approach,
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.780]   but also I would say there's no given percentages.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:42.940]   For instance, actually, at some point
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:46.140]   I was really curious about it and I looked.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:50.340]   And for each picture of this nature,
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:53.300]   and there are a bunch of them you can easily find online,
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:57.220]   my mind immediately interprets it in a particular way.
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:00.020]   But because I know that other people
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:03.020]   could see it differently, I would then strain my mind,
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.580]   and strain my eyes, and stare at it,
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:07.540]   and try to see it in a different way.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.500]   And sometimes I could see it right away,
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.980]   and then I could go back and forth between the two.
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:16.380]   And sometimes it took me a while for some pictures.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:19.380]   So in that sense, even if these probabilities exist,
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:20.420]   they are subjective.
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:22.340]   Some people immediately see it this way,
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.620]   some people immediately see it that way,
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:25.860]   and I think that nobody knows.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:28.380]   Not psychologists, not neuroscientists, not philosophers
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:29.380]   what to make of it.
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:34.940]   The best answer, of course, as a scientific mind,
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:38.100]   even though I say, no, don't look for interpretation,
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:40.740]   leave some place for mysticism or mystery, right?
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.580]   I say that.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:44.180]   But of course I want a theory, I want an explanation.
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:46.580]   So the best explanation I find
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.660]   is from Niels Bohr's complementarity principle.
[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:51.500]   So it is like particle and wave,
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.660]   that there are different ways to look at it.
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:56.940]   And when you look at it in a particular way,
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.580]   another side will be obscured.
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.420]   Think about it like the other side of the moon.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.380]   So we are observing the moon from one side,
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.360]   and then we don't see the other side.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.020]   There is a complementary perspective
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.500]   where we see the other side,
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.300]   but not the side we normally see.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:13.120]   But the moon is the same, it's still there.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.860]   It's our limitations of being able to grasp the whole.
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:18.980]   That's complementarity.
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:21.780]   And we know that from quantum mechanics
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.020]   that our physical reality is like that.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:26.380]   Rather than being certain,
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:28.220]   rather than being one way or another.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:32.080]   - And we should just, as a small aside,
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.980]   in terms of neural networks, mention that
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.580]   at the end of the day, there's humans,
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.100]   it's built on top of humans.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:43.140]   Or with Chad GPT that is using reinforcement learning
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:48.140]   by human feedback, we're actually using a set of humans
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:50.460]   to teach the networks.
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.400]   And that's the thing that people don't often talk about,
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.580]   because, or I sometimes think about that
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:59.700]   those humans all have a life story.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.520]   Each human, the annotated data,
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.980]   that fed data to the network, or did the RLHF,
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.180]   they have a life story.
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.220]   They grew up, they have biases.
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.780]   - They have biases, there's some things that they like,
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:13.380]   there's some things they don't like,
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.220]   which can kind of appear under their radar screen.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.100]   They may not be aware that they are exercising those biases.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.960]   - That's the point, what you brought up
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:25.400]   is a very important issue here.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.320]   Not so much issue, but it's not a bug,
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.680]   it's a feature in my opinion.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.440]   That implicit in the discussion of the question
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.720]   is thinking computational and so on,
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.800]   is the idea that our conscious awareness
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.680]   covers everything within our psyche.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.640]   And we just know that that's not the case.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:49.720]   We have, all of us have observed other people
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.280]   who have had sort of destructive tendencies.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.440]   So obviously, they did things destructive for themselves.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.120]   And many of us have observed ourselves doing that
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.500]   as part of human nature.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:04.680]   And there is great research in analytic psychology
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.680]   and in the past 100 years, strongly suggesting,
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.040]   if not proving, the existence of what Carl Jung called
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.320]   the personal unconscious and also collective unconscious.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.360]   This kind of a circle of ideas,
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.000]   which are under the radar screen,
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000]   which lead us to some strong emotions
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.760]   and inspire us to act in certain ways,
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.160]   even if we cannot really understand.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.640]   So if we accept that, then the proposition
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   that somehow everything can still be covered by our actions,
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.320]   which are totally kind of neutral
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.760]   and totally righteous and totally conscious,
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.480]   that it becomes really tenuous.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.800]   - Let me ask you some tricky questions.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.800]   - Uh-oh.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.480]   - In terms of how big they are.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.960]   In terms of how, you know, they become difficult
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.060]   because of how much of a romantic you are.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:05.720]   What to you is the most beautiful idea in mathematics?
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.440]   Another one we can ask is,
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.500]   what is the most beautiful equation in mathematics?
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.660]   - Hmm.
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:17.500]   Well, I mean.
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.140]   (Lex laughing)
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:20.940]   - I may have just broken your brain.
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:24.620]   Because what your brain is doing
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:29.620]   is walking down a long memory lane of beautiful experiences.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.780]   - Well, you see, in mathematics,
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:35.620]   we have this idea that, we have an idea of a set, right?
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.340]   So we have a collection of things.
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:39.700]   For instance, you know, the set of tables,
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:43.420]   the set of chairs, and so on, or set of microphones.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.780]   But it could be a set of numbers.
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:47.260]   Could be a set of ideas.
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:50.420]   Could be a set of formulas, mathematical equations.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.020]   And then we have the notion of an ordered set,
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:55.740]   ordered, like the set in which there is order.
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:58.740]   Which means that for every two members of the set,
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.460]   we'll say which one is better than the other
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.860]   or greater than the other.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:04.700]   For instance, all numbers are ordered.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.020]   Five is greater than three,
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.780]   five is less than seven, and so on.
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:10.780]   But not all sets are ordered.
[01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:13.060]   So the set of beautiful theorems is not,
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:15.020]   beautiful equations is not ordered.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.660]   (both laughing)
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:20.540]   So in other words, there are many best equations.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:25.540]   And so, Richard Feynman chose one,
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.420]   which I think one of the best,
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:31.580]   is that if you take E, the base of natural logarithm,
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:33.740]   to the power pi i, so you have pi,
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:36.380]   you have E in it, the base of natural logarithm,
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:39.900]   you have pi, i, which is square root of negative one,
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:44.100]   then the result is negative one.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.780]   So that's up there, for sure,
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:49.860]   in the pantheon of beautiful formulas, you know?
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:53.260]   That I think pretty much every mathematician would agree.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:56.260]   I don't know what my favorite one is.
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:59.780]   - I'm just lingering on that one, Euler's Identity.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:01.460]   What makes it beautiful?
[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.660]   Just a few symbols together.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:04.500]   - Right.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.140]   - I mean, part of it is actually just trying to define
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:10.320]   what is beautiful about mathematics.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.380]   That is,
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:15.900]   laid in there, in this particular equation,
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:18.700]   that is somehow revealed when the human eye looks at it.
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.560]   Why is it beautiful, do you think?
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.660]   Pi, i--
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:27.220]   - There is an element of surprise in it.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.420]   How is it possible?
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.420]   We always think of pi as the ratio
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:34.720]   between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.780]   Here, we are taking some number to the power pi.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:41.900]   Not even pi, mind you.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:44.340]   But pi multiplied by square root of negative one.
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:51.420]   Surely, this is something completely incomprehensible.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:54.740]   And yet, the result is negative one, you see?
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:57.020]   And if you take e to the power two pi i,
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.380]   you get one, actually one.
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:03.880]   So I would guess that that's, but in other words,
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.880]   the initial reaction is just that it was surprise, I guess.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:13.260]   I guess for anyone who first comes across.
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:17.220]   - That these three folks, four folks got together.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:22.220]   It reminds me of the idea that Hitler, Stalin,
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.940]   Trotsky, and Freud were all in Vienna
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.700]   in some early, at the beginning of the '20s.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.580]   - And Wittgenstein was a classmate of Hitler, you know this.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.180]   - I did not know this, no.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:35.360]   - So there, it makes you, you know,
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.180]   you can imagine a situation where they're all
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:40.980]   sitting at a bar together at some point, not knowing it.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.940]   But they somehow, it all made sense in space, time,
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:45.660]   to be located there.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:48.140]   And that's what this feels like, some kind of intersection.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.460]   - Intersection, yes.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:53.220]   But I would say that after the initial shock,
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:56.340]   you look at the proof of this equation.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:58.140]   And it actually does make sense.
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:02.020]   And actually, it is nothing but the statement
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.940]   that the circumference of the circle is.
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:07.020]   And in fact, in this case, it's the circumference
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:10.140]   of a semicircle is equal to pi.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:11.740]   And that's where it comes from.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:14.220]   - In the end, the truth is simple.
[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:15.220]   - In the end, the truth is simple.
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.480]   Not necessarily easy, but simple.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:21.420]   - So I mentioned to you offline that I desperately,
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:24.700]   in trying to figure out the optimal,
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:27.520]   in an ordered set, questions to ask you,
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.380]   texted Eric Weinstein asking for what questions
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.660]   he can ask you.
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:36.100]   And he said that you are definitively
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:38.220]   one of the greatest living mathematicians,
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:39.820]   so don't screw this up.
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:42.580]   But he did give me a few questions.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:46.340]   So he asked to ask you,
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.380]   what are the most shockingly passionate,
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.140]   this is in Eric's language,
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:52.100]   what are the most shockingly passionate
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.580]   mathematical structures?
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:56.460]   And he gave a list of four for him.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.700]   But he said he really wanted your list.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:01.420]   Okay, let me say that.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:05.740]   Shockingly passionate mathematical structures.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:06.580]   - Shocking.
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:09.100]   (Lex laughing)
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.740]   - Is there something you can,
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:12.420]   is there something that jumps to mind?
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.260]   - Sure.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:16.860]   I'm here to shock.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:18.300]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:21.700]   - So first of all, Eric Weinstein is a very dear friend,
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:22.580]   I have to say.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:25.700]   And I really, really, really appreciate and love him.
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:26.940]   He's just like my brother.
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.980]   So it's interesting to have a question posed by him.
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:34.740]   - And maybe if we can linger for a moment,
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:38.260]   what do you think is special about Eric Weinstein
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.540]   for you know of his work and his mind?
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:44.900]   - The way he sort of straddles so many different disciplines.
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:46.340]   It's like a Renaissance man.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.620]   There are very few people like that at any given moment,
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:50.740]   let alone the 21st century,
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:55.020]   where information has become so huge
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.740]   that it's almost physically impossible
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:55:58.140]   to be able to keep track of things.
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:02.860]   And yet, he does, and he has his own unique vision
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:05.580]   and unique point of view, and he has integrity,
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:07.620]   which is like almost impossible.
[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:10.420]   Like I can't think of so many people
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:13.540]   who possess those qualities, almost no one.
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:19.060]   - And also the ability, in some sense,
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:22.320]   to embody the balance that you talked about,
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:28.300]   of both the rigor of mathematics and the imagination.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:30.260]   - Humanity also, I would say.
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:32.340]   You know, like we talk about imagination
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:38.060]   as a kind of a counterpoint to knowledge or logic.
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.620]   But just basic humanity, you know,
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:43.580]   just basic compassion, just being able to,
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:48.180]   because every destructive, I would say,
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.940]   like every destructive society,
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:54.660]   you know, like be it Germany under Hitler
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.700]   or Soviet Union under Stalin and so on,
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:00.340]   was based on some kind of what was considered
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:02.260]   unassailable truths.
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:04.100]   So a kind of conceptual system, you know,
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.780]   if you think about it, right?
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:10.020]   There is a beautiful episode of this series
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:13.320]   by Jacob Bronowski, you know,
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:18.980]   where he talks about, he filmed it in Auschwitz,
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:22.780]   talking about the certainty that what led the Nazis
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.780]   to killing people wholesale was a certain,
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:30.260]   it was almost a mathematical idea.
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:32.620]   And they just basically bought into this idea
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.140]   and checked out their humanity at the door.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:38.700]   So I would say that antidote to this type of thing
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:41.020]   is not necessarily even imagination
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.380]   in a kind of elevated sense
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:44.620]   that we have been discussing today,
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:49.260]   that is exemplified by our greatest scientists
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:55.340]   and philosophers, but just basic humanity,
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:58.980]   you know, basic common sense of just like knowing
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:00.780]   that it's just not right.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:03.980]   And I don't care what my ideology tells me,
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:05.920]   but I'm just not going to do it.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:10.260]   So that I think is kind of missing a little bit
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:12.900]   in today's society, 'cause people get a lot too caught up
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:16.620]   in the ideology, in certain conceptual frameworks.
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:19.980]   - So societies that lose that basic human compassion,
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:22.540]   that basic humanity, run into trouble.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.380]   - Oh, very much so.
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:25.220]   But not only society, like a human being.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:29.480]   - And Eric is one of the people, I agree with you,
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:30.580]   keeps that flame of--
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:33.340]   - Like I trust that he will not do something
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:37.260]   that's not human, that's not right.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.300]   I just feel, you know, like there's some people
[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:42.540]   you just kind of feel that they won't cross that line.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:45.460]   And that's a huge thing, you know, today.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:47.340]   Because I have to say, looking back,
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:51.140]   definitely I have not hurt people personally,
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:55.940]   but I could be mean, for instance, I could be harsh.
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:58.900]   And now I see it as a sign of weakness,
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.540]   as a sign of insecurity.
[01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:05.620]   You know, I saw your interview with Ray Kurzweil
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:07.020]   the other day.
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:09.060]   Beautiful, I was really moved by it.
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:11.020]   But you know, at some point I was like,
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.580]   I looked at him at this sort of like Dr. Evil.
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.660]   (both laughing)
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:17.820]   I'm kind of ashamed of it now,
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:20.700]   but like, you know, I'm kind of coming clean.
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.060]   And I would, you know, because, well, why?
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:28.380]   Because I needed an adversary in my mind.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.140]   Because I projected onto him kind of the fears that I had,
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:35.240]   that AI will conquer us and so on.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:40.240]   And this was rooted in my kind of awakening moment,
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:42.620]   in a sense, a kind of a moment where I suddenly started
[01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.340]   to see the other side.
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:47.460]   So, but I wasn't sure yet, you see?
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:48.300]   - You had to feel it.
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.020]   - So I had to have a fight about it.
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:52.380]   - Yeah, you had to actually have the projection.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.980]   - I had to, so it was not in,
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:55.860]   I believe that it was not in me already,
[01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:57.780]   so I had to throw it onto somebody.
[01:59:57.780 --> 01:59:58.900]   - Yeah.
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:00.180]   - And that's not balance yet.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:03.500]   So balance is when you recognize that it's you, actually.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:06.380]   And I had this moment, actually, it was so amazing.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.820]   Like, I would give this mean,
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:09.820]   I would talk about AI and the dangers,
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:12.780]   and he would always be my foil.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:15.380]   You know, I would put a sinister photograph
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:17.620]   of him on the slide.
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:19.420]   And I was like, "Look at this guy.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:22.260]   "He wants to put nanobots into your brain.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:27.060]   "And he's also a top executive at Google," and so on.
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:29.020]   So I would create this whole narrative.
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:31.460]   And then something happened,
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:35.220]   where I was giving a lecture, this is 2015,
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:38.660]   in Aspen, Aspen Ideas Festival,
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:41.220]   which is a wonderful festival.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:43.180]   So keynote speech, actually.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.100]   And I was doing my usual shtick.
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:47.580]   And then suddenly I said,
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:49.740]   I came up to that,
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:52.220]   oh, there was a big screen,
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:53.820]   and there was a picture of him there.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:54.820]   And I came up to the screen,
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:56.300]   and I kind of touched it with my hand,
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:59.860]   and I said, "But I don't want to pick on Mr. Kusla,
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:01.540]   "because he's me."
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:03.620]   I had this revelation
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:05.180]   that I'm actually fighting with myself,
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:06.260]   with my own fears.
[02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:10.020]   And then I learned about
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:16.220]   his father, that his father died when he was young.
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:19.900]   And that he's, in fact,
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:22.300]   he's very, to his credit,
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:25.420]   he's very sincere and upfront about it.
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:27.340]   Self-disclosure, I think, is very essential,
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:28.460]   by the way, in all this discussion.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.620]   Like, what really motivates you?
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:33.660]   He said it publicly many times,
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:36.140]   even as early as 2015,
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:37.660]   I could find this information,
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:43.860]   that he wanted to reunite with his father in the cloud.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:46.780]   And suddenly I saw him not as a caricature
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:50.820]   that exemplified all my fears,
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:52.060]   but as a human being,
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:54.980]   a child longing for his father,
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:56.780]   grieving for his father.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.540]   So suddenly it became a story, a love story.
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.820]   And, you know,
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:05.420]   so that is,
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:08.180]   so in other words, I've seen it in myself,
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:09.020]   this
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:15.300]   capacity to project my own fears
[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:18.140]   and then fight with other people over something
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:20.460]   that actually was my own.
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:23.180]   And as soon as I got to this point of seeing him,
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.300]   and then my next lecture,
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:25.980]   actually I talked about it,
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:28.300]   about him in this way.
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:31.180]   And I said, "Look, it's a love story.
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:32.460]   And he is actually,
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:37.500]   it's not how I would want to reunite with my father.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:42.260]   But like you said,
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:45.420]   if I am consistent,
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:48.060]   I have to allow the possibility that different people
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:51.580]   perceive things differently.
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:53.940]   And so for him,
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:55.860]   that's his imagination.
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:57.260]   So, you know how,
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:58.780]   who is this, Voltaire, I think,
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:02:59.900]   he's ascribed to Voltaire.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:01.180]   So it's like, I disagree with you,
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:02.860]   but I will fight to death
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:04.740]   for you to have the right to say it.
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:08.540]   So now that I feel like my position is more like,
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.540]   I disagree with him,
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:13.380]   that this is the way to approach death
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:15.940]   and to approach the death of loved ones
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:18.700]   and how we miss them and how we,
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:21.420]   you know, that sense of loneliness
[02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:23.700]   and inability to interact directly.
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:28.100]   That's not something that resonates with me,
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.300]   but I think it's also,
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.940]   it can also be called imagination from his perspective.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:36.860]   And look, motivated by that,
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:39.300]   how much he has brought,
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.300]   how many interesting inventions,
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:43.820]   like his musical inventions, for instance,
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:46.900]   naturally, because his father was a composer,
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:49.780]   music composer and a conductor.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:53.580]   So in other words, in the bigger scheme of things,
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.220]   even if I think he's misguided,
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:03.300]   still, I can't deny that it's a certain leap of faith
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:05.460]   from his perspective to try to say
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:08.660]   that this is the way we can all connect to our loved ones.
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:10.260]   And because it is sincere,
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:11.700]   and I see it now, it's sincere.
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:13.020]   And in fact, in your interview,
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:15.660]   you really teased it out of him.
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:17.420]   I was really moved by it, I have to say.
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.020]   It's like, he has mellowed a little bit too, I say.
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:23.060]   It was really, really sweet
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:24.460]   when he talked about his father.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:27.140]   And I can relate, you know, my father died four years ago,
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:30.580]   and I can relate what a heartbreak,
[02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:33.860]   I was much older than Ray was when his father died.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:38.860]   But I can relate to this longing and that grief, you know.
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:41.300]   And when somebody is sincere,
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:45.100]   and he puts his, opens his cards,
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:48.500]   and says, "This is why, this is why I want to do it,
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.660]   "because I want to recreate my father,
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:53.740]   "and I want to be able to talk to him this way."
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:56.620]   Then we have a serious, then we understand,
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:01.620]   you know, the opposite of it would be not disclosing,
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:07.700]   and just pretending that this is how
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:10.140]   it's supposed to be in scientific terms.
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:13.460]   So, it was replacing your real emotion
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:14.820]   that comes from the heart,
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:17.180]   by some kind of a theory which comes from the mind.
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:19.020]   And this is where we can go astray,
[02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:23.660]   because then we become captives of frameworks
[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:25.420]   and conceptual systems,
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:28.420]   which may not be beneficial to our society.
[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:30.180]   - In tough times, we need the people
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:33.580]   that have not lost their way in the ideologies.
[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:35.620]   We need the people who are still in touch with their heart.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:38.580]   And you mentioned this with Eric, it's certainly true.
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:40.860]   I disagree with him on a lot of stuff,
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:44.020]   but I feel like when the world is burning down,
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:46.900]   Eric is one of the people that you can still count on
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:48.260]   to have a heart.
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.700]   We've talked a lot over the past year
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:51.380]   about the war in Ukraine,
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:54.820]   the possibility of nuclear war,
[02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:58.220]   and it feels like he's one of the people I would call first,
[02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:05.460]   if, God forbid, something like a nuclear war would begin.
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:07.820]   Because you look for people with a heart,
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.100]   no matter their ideas.
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:10.220]   - That's right.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:12.700]   It takes courage, and it takes a certain self-awareness,
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:13.540]   I would say.
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:19.180]   I think the crucial is that which was inscribed
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:21.380]   on the temple of Apollo in Delphi.
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:23.820]   There was a statement, "Know thyself, know yourself."
[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.420]   You know, like, who am I?
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:28.900]   Ultimately, it boils down to this, and all these debates.
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:32.540]   And the point is that I used to be, like I said,
[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:33.660]   pessimistic at some point,
[02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:38.180]   and I was scared, even, of where development of AI was going.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.460]   This is about 2014, 2015.
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:43.260]   And now I'm much more...
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:47.940]   So, for instance, after I saw Ray Kurzweil as a human being,
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:52.380]   after I could relate to him, and sympathize with him,
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:55.620]   suddenly, I stopped seeing him in the news.
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:57.660]   Like, before that, I would always see him in the news,
[02:06:57.660 --> 02:07:00.020]   saying, "We're going to put nanobots in your brain,
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:02.140]   "da-da-da, by the year 2030," or whatever, you know?
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:04.300]   "And then we upload you by 21st,"
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:07.660]   and I would be like, "No, you know, that's sort of terrible."
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.940]   Suddenly, I didn't see him anymore.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:11.420]   I had to, you know?
[02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:13.500]   So now, it makes me question,
[02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:15.940]   who was creating the trouble? (laughs)
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:16.780]   - What was all with it?
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:18.740]   - Was it him who was creating the trouble,
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:21.100]   or was it my mind, you see?
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:25.180]   And so, as I became self-aware,
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:27.980]   suddenly, other possibilities opened.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.820]   And suddenly, that conflict, which, by the way,
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:34.820]   if I kept giving these nasty talks about him,
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:37.260]   one day, I suppose, we'd have a debate,
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:40.380]   and so you have this, one person says this,
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:42.220]   and then that, and what I learned
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:44.780]   is that it's a never-ending conflict.
[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:46.700]   This conflict just does not end.
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:50.700]   But there is an alternative, there is a better way,
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:55.180]   which is to realize that it is you, arguing with yourself.
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:57.860]   Now, if you want to continue arguing with yourself,
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:01.860]   continue, as long as you need.
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:04.100]   Just be careful not to destroy too many things,
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.280]   you know, in the process.
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:08.180]   But there is an option of actually dropping it,
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:09.500]   of actually dropping it.
[02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:12.300]   This is so, I was so surprised by this.
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:14.300]   - Yeah, it's discovering in yourself
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:17.540]   the human capacity for compassion,
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:20.580]   and you understand that he has a perspective,
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:22.820]   he is operating in the space of imagination,
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:24.300]   a human being like you,
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:25.740]   and we're all in this kind of together,
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:27.500]   trying to figure this out. - But we're on the same boat,
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.360]   ultimately, and also, it's like,
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.580]   with realizing how much I have screwed up,
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:34.860]   you know, comes this humility also.
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:37.180]   So, I find it extremely hard now
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:39.340]   to really lash out at somebody,
[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:41.500]   and to say, like, you're horrible, whatever,
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.900]   because immediately, the question is,
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:46.300]   who am I to criticize, you know?
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:48.520]   So, is there another way to have a dialogue?
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.900]   Is there a way to, you know, speaking,
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:54.940]   you know, since we talked about the innocence of a child,
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:58.220]   and how much it drives a discovery in science, and so on,
[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:00.500]   you know, I remember, I think I heard,
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:02.460]   Adyashanti, who gave this nice example,
[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:04.380]   he's like, when you're a kid, you know,
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:06.220]   you go and you play with your friends,
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:07.660]   and then you fight with another kid,
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:10.500]   and he was like, I hate you, I don't wanna see you again,
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:12.540]   and you just go home, like, after half an hour,
[02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:13.600]   okay, what are you gonna do?
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:14.780]   You wanna play?
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.940]   So, you come out, it's like, hey, you wanna play?
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:19.700]   You don't talk about what happened,
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:23.340]   you don't rehash this, you know, just keep going.
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:26.180]   And sometimes, I think we are on the verge,
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.340]   maybe, of learning that,
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:34.180]   because I think that if we continue to push each of us,
[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:38.300]   our set of ideas, and ideologies,
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:42.340]   and, you know, what matters to us, and so on,
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.240]   like, yeah, no, no, what matters to you,
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.520]   but like, there are other ways to approach other people,
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:50.120]   there are other ways, you can find point of contact.
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.980]   Speaking of which, mathematics, mathematical formulas,
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:58.460]   are universal, represent universal knowledge.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:01.520]   Two plus two is four, whether you vote for this guy
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:03.520]   or that guy in the election, you know,
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:08.140]   how about that as a point of contact, of commonality,
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:10.360]   you know, and nobody can patent those formulas,
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:11.520]   did you know that?
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.600]   And there is a Supreme Court decision
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.600]   that mathematical formulas cannot be patented,
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.200]   like Einstein could not patent E equals MC squared,
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:20.160]   it doesn't belong to him,
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.840]   because if the formula is correct,
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:24.240]   then it belongs to everyone.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:29.800]   - So what do you think of that all too tricky question?
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:32.560]   If you want, I can deeply bias your answer
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:35.120]   by giving the list of four that Eric provided.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.360]   - Oh, no, let me give mine,
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.760]   I cannot see, by the way, what you have, so,
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:40.560]   but I can guess some of them.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:43.160]   So I'm going to try to do something different from him.
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:44.920]   So I already mentioned one,
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:49.880]   which is that you have one-dimensional numerical system,
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:51.840]   which is real numbers, you have two-dimensional,
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:54.240]   which is complex numbers, you have four-dimensional,
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:56.440]   and it's probably connected to what he wrote,
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:59.200]   because it has to do with some homotopic groups of spheres
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:00.200]   and stuff like that.
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.640]   Then, of course, one I love, okay,
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.720]   one plus two plus three plus four,
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.660]   plus five plus six, and so on.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:14.020]   Does it make any sense, the sum?
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:15.580]   You probably heard about this one,
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:18.020]   it became very popular at some point.
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:21.180]   One plus two plus three, I did a video for Numberphile,
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:23.660]   the YouTube channel about it, maybe 10 years ago.
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:25.900]   So one plus two plus three plus four plus five
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:30.700]   ostensibly diverges, goes to infinity,
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:32.500]   because you get a bigger and bigger number.
[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:35.700]   And yet, there is a way to make sense of it,
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:39.500]   in which it comes up to minus one over 12.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:41.420]   How fascinating.
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:43.820]   First of all, the answer is not even a positive number,
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:45.740]   and it's not an integer, it's not a whole number,
[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:47.180]   it's minus one over 12.
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:49.940]   So sometimes people ask me, what is your favorite number?
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:52.500]   And it's kind of a joke, I say minus one over 12.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.660]   (laughing)
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:54.780]   It's actually 42.
[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.980]   (laughing)
[02:11:56.980 --> 02:11:59.380]   - So your favorite number is not an ordered set.
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:01.940]   - Right. - So what else?
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:02.780]   - What else?
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:04.040]   - So-- - Langlands program,
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.680]   of course, I have to mention that.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.260]   - And we'll explore that in depth.
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:09.420]   Do you know what Eric said?
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:10.420]   - Sure.
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:15.420]   - Sphere aversion, Boy's surface, hop vibration--
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.940]   - Co-vibration, okay.
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:21.100]   - And pi one of SO three.
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:25.180]   - Okay, oh yes, so that's the famous cup trick, you know?
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:26.900]   Okay, look, so this is how it works.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:28.460]   (laughing)
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:29.660]   - No tricks. - No tricks.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.060]   - No magic. - So honest.
[02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:32.260]   It is magical, okay?
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:35.420]   But not because I'm tricking you.
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:39.020]   So you start with a bottle like this, or a cup,
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:41.060]   and you start twisting it,
[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:44.140]   and at the same time you twist your arm.
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:46.780]   Then you come, so this is actually going to
[02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:50.500]   rotate it 360 degrees, the full turn.
[02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:53.780]   Then you say, okay, I won't be able to do another turn
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:55.660]   because then my arm would really get twisted,
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:57.140]   I'll have to go see a doctor.
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:00.260]   Yet, if I do it a second time, it untwists.
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:04.740]   This is the pi one of SO three.
[02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:06.260]   Eric is talking about it.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:10.180]   So there is something where the first motion is not trivial,
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:12.380]   but if you double down on it,
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:15.020]   you come back to the initial position.
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.900]   It's very closely connected to the fact that
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:18.860]   we have elementary particles of two types,
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:20.020]   bosons and fermions.
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:23.900]   So bosons are, for example, photons,
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:26.660]   or carriers of other forces, or the Higgs boson.
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:29.580]   It is called a boson for a reason, because it is a boson.
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:35.780]   In honor of Indian mathematician Bose, B-O-S-E, and Einstein.
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:38.180]   So these particles obey what's called
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:40.280]   Bose-Einstein statistics.
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.820]   But then there are other particles called fermions,
[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:47.900]   in honor of Enrico Fermi, Italian-born mathematician
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:49.440]   who worked in the US.
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:54.540]   And they follow what's called Dirac-Fermi statistics.
[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:57.780]   And those are electrons and constituents of matter,
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:00.380]   electrons, protons, neutrons, and so on.
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:04.380]   And they have a certain duplicity, if you will.
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:06.620]   And that duplicity is rooted mathematically
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:08.980]   in this experiment, this little experiment
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.080]   that I have just done.
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:14.260]   So I can, I imagine, speaking of imagination, okay?
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:16.180]   So I'm just kind of riffing on this.
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:19.920]   Imagine a world in which this will not be shocking,
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:21.940]   or like, in this case it's not even shocking
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:24.340]   because I haven't really explained the details,
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:26.400]   because I can't do it in two minutes.
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:31.280]   I indicated what this is all about, and so on.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:34.440]   But imagine a world in which this is not foreign
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.840]   to most people, that most people have seen it before.
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.160]   They're not afraid to approach this type of questions,
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.160]   because, you know, we talked a little bit
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.000]   about math education, but I really believe
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]   that a lot of people in our society,
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.720]   and it is not only in the United States,
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:51.920]   but throughout the world, a lot of people
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.780]   have been traumatized.
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:55.620]   It's really PTSD.
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.800]   That's why people, when they see a mathematical formula,
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.880]   or even like, how do you need to calculate tip on a bill?
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.440]   They're just, they're terrified,
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:05.560]   because it brings up those memories
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:09.680]   when they were kids and being called to blackboard
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:14.360]   and solve a problem, you can't solve a problem,
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:16.400]   and unscrupulous teacher says, "You're an idiot.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:20.960]   "Sit down," and you feel ashamed and lowly,
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.620]   and that stays with you.
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.380]   And so I think that, unfortunately, that's where we are.
[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:29.360]   But I, one can dream, and so my dream is that one day
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:31.440]   we'll be able to overcome this,
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:34.560]   and actually, all of these treasures of mathematics
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.960]   will become widely available,
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:40.320]   or at least people will know where to find them,
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.080]   and they will not be afraid of going there and looking.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.800]   And I think this will help, because like I said,
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:48.000]   for one thing, it gives you a sense of belonging.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.120]   It gives you, it kind of is an antidote
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:53.560]   to the kind of alienation and separation
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:55.360]   that we feel today, oftentimes,
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.800]   because of ideological divide, sectarian strife,
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.020]   and all kinds of things like that.
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.920]   Because then you will, once you see,
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:04.440]   there's like a critical mass of this beauty
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:07.080]   that kind of dawns on you, it's like,
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.340]   my God, this is what we all have in common.
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.960]   - You mentioned Langlands program.
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:16.080]   We have to talk about it.
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:16.920]   - Sure.
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:18.480]   - At the core of your book and your work
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:19.800]   is the Langlands program.
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:21.340]   Can you describe what it is?
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:28.080]   - Sure, so Langlands is a mathematician.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.960]   It's a name of a mathematician, Robert Langlands.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:35.080]   Canadian born, still alive.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:37.840]   He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:40.840]   that we talked about, where Einstein and Gödel
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:43.240]   and other great scientists have worked.
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:47.400]   In fact, he used to occupy the office of Albert Einstein
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:49.160]   at the Institute for Advanced Study.
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:55.040]   So he, in the late '60s,
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.440]   he came up with a set of ideas
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:01.240]   which captivated a lot of mathematicians,
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:04.200]   several generations of mathematicians by now,
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.600]   which came to be known as the Langlands program.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:09.800]   And what it is about is connecting
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:11.560]   different fields of mathematics,
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:13.760]   which seem to be far away from each other.
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:16.000]   For example, number theory,
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.640]   which as the name suggests, deals with numbers,
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:23.600]   and various equations with, you know,
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.640]   like x squared plus y squared equals one.
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:31.680]   And on the other side, harmonic analysis,
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:37.000]   something that any music lover can appreciate
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.860]   because the sound of a symphony can be kind of decomposed
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:42.440]   into sounds of different instruments,
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:44.120]   and each of those sounds can be represented
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.640]   by a wave like this, like a sine function.
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:49.040]   Those are the harmonics.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:51.520]   They oscillate, the period of a harmonic,
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.240]   periods of different notes are different,
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.520]   they correspond to different notes,
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:58.800]   and different instruments, different semitones, if you will.
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:01.280]   But they all combine together into something,
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:04.340]   something special, which is not,
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:07.200]   cannot be reduced to any one of those.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:08.980]   So it's that, mathematically, it's the idea
[02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:13.120]   that you can decompose a signal into,
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.240]   as a collection, as a simultaneous oscillation
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:18.400]   of several elementary signals.
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.040]   That's called harmonic analysis.
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:24.380]   So what Langlands found is that some really difficult
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:27.780]   questions in number theory can be translated
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:31.740]   into much more easily tractable questions
[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:32.720]   in harmonic analysis.
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:35.020]   That was his initial idea.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:38.680]   But what happened next surprised everybody,
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:41.000]   that the kind of patterns that he was able to observe,
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.960]   the kind of regularities that he was able to observe,
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:44.760]   which were quite surprising,
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.740]   were subsequently found in other areas of mathematics.
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:50.480]   For example, in geometry.
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:53.000]   And eventually in quantum physics.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.560]   So in fact, Ed Witten, who is kind of a dean
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.600]   of modern theoretical physicists,
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:02.480]   professor at the Institute for Advanced Study as well,
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.880]   got interested in this subject.
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:06.000]   I describe in my book how it happened.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:11.880]   And he was instrumental in bridging the gap
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.120]   between these patterns found in physics and in geometry,
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:21.120]   finding kind of a superstratum, if you will,
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.600]   or a way to connect these two things,
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:26.600]   kind of a bridge between these two fields.
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.240]   So subsequently I collaborate with Witten on this,
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:33.160]   and this has been one of the major themes of my research.
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:40.000]   I always found it interesting to connect things,
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.120]   to unite things.
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:47.000]   When I was younger, I couldn't understand why,
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.660]   but I was always interested in,
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:53.540]   not in working in specific field,
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:55.800]   but kind of cutting across fields.
[02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:01.920]   And then I would discover that, for instance,
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:04.440]   I talked to some people who know what happens in this field,
[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:09.000]   but don't know what happens in that field, or conversely.
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:13.360]   And then I would find it imperative
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:16.480]   to go out and explain to them,
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:19.540]   to the different sides what this is all about,
[02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:22.640]   so that more people are aware of these hidden structures,
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:25.860]   of these hidden parallels, if you will.
[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:28.800]   So that has been sort of a theme in my research.
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:32.680]   And so I guess now I kind of understand more why
[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:37.120]   it's kind of a balance, like what we talked about earlier.
[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:40.840]   - So can you elucidate a little bit how,
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:43.080]   what are the mathematical tools that allow you
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:47.840]   to connect these different continents of mathematics?
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:51.640]   Is there something you can convert into words
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.800]   that Langlands was able to find,
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.640]   and you were able to explore further?
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:59.240]   - I would say what it suggests is that there is some
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:02.800]   hidden principles, which we still don't understand.
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:06.200]   My view is that we still don't know why.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:09.440]   That we can prove some instances of this,
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:12.900]   correspondences and connections,
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:16.880]   but we still don't know the real underlying reasons,
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:19.320]   which means that there is a certain layer
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:22.800]   beneath the surface that we see now.
[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:27.140]   It is like, so the way I see it now is like this,
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:30.580]   that there is something three-dimensional, like this bottle,
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:33.240]   but what we are seeing is this projection onto the table,
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:34.560]   and the projection onto a wall.
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:37.400]   And then we can map things from one projection to another,
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:39.880]   and you say, oh my God, that's incredible.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:42.120]   But the real explanation is that both of them
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:43.840]   are projections of the same thing,
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.520]   and that we haven't found yet.
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.560]   But that's what I want to find,
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:48.900]   so that's what motivates me, I would say.
[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:53.440]   - From number theory to geometry to quantum physics.
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:55.000]   - So there is this one thing,
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.640]   which has different projections,
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:58.960]   except it's not just the table and the wall,
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:02.720]   but there are like many different walls, if you will.
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.480]   - So what is the philosophical implication
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:08.280]   that there is commonalities like that
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:11.080]   across these very disparate fields?
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:13.020]   - It means that what we believe
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:17.160]   are the fundamental elements of mathematics
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:19.560]   are not fundamental, there is something beyond.
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:24.480]   It's like we previously thought that atoms were indivisible.
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:27.360]   Then we found out that there is a nucleus and electrons,
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.680]   and the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons.
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:30.640]   Then we thought, okay,
[02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:33.200]   protons and neutrons must be elementary.
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.840]   Now we know they consist of quarks.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.060]   So it's about kind of finding the quarks of mathematics.
[02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:40.440]   (Lex laughing)
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:42.680]   - Of course, beyond that, there's maybe even more.
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:44.180]   - Which was my initial motivation
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:46.280]   to study mathematics, by the way, right?
[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:49.180]   - Quarks was the first time you fell in love
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:50.800]   with understanding the nature of reality.
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:52.120]   - Yeah.
[02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:54.080]   - What was it like working with Ed Witten,
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:59.080]   who many people say is one of the smartest humans in history?
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:04.920]   Or at least mathematical physicist in history?
[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:07.320]   - Yes, fascinating.
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:08.600]   I enjoyed it very much.
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:11.640]   I also felt that I have to keep up, you know?
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:16.280]   And so we wrote this long paper in 2007,
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:19.180]   and we collaborated for about a year.
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:22.160]   I have known him before, and we talked before,
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:24.640]   and I've seen him since, and we talked.
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:27.200]   But it's very different to just meet somebody
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.200]   at conferences and have a conversation,
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:33.520]   as opposed to actually working on a project together.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.280]   So he's very, very serious, very focused.
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:40.480]   This is one thing which I have to say,
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:42.640]   I was really struck by this.
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:47.120]   - Why is he considered to be such a powerful intellect
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:49.820]   by many other powerful intellects?
[02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:56.240]   - He has had this unique vision of the subject.
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:59.280]   He was able to connect different things,
[02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:03.400]   especially find connections
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.780]   between quantum physics and mathematics.
[02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:08.160]   Almost unparalleled.
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:11.000]   I don't think anyone comes close, in some sense,
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.800]   in the last 50 years to him,
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:18.880]   in terms of finding just consistently, time after time,
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.360]   breaking ground, new ground, new ground.
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:25.360]   So he would basically, one way one could describe it is,
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:28.760]   he would take some idea in physics,
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:35.120]   and then find an interpretation of it in mathematics,
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:40.280]   and then say, distill it, present it in mathematical terms,
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:43.560]   and tell mathematicians, this should be like that.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.820]   Kind of like, one plus two plus three plus four
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:47.680]   is minus one over 12.
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.040]   And mathematicians would be like, no way.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:54.320]   And then it would pan out,
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.200]   and mathematicians would then,
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:58.480]   like a whole industry would be created
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:01.400]   of groups of mathematicians trying to prove
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.760]   his conjectures and his ideas,
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:06.640]   and he would always be proven right.
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:09.440]   So in other words, being able to glean
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:13.440]   some mathematical truths from physical theories.
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:14.640]   That's one side.
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:16.800]   On the other hand, conversely,
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:18.920]   applying sophisticated mathematics.
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:23.920]   He's probably the physicist who could learn
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:26.580]   mathematics the fastest, I don't think.
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:30.760]   Some younger physicists maybe could come close,
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:33.640]   but it's still quite, for them a long way to go
[02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:37.840]   to get, to be comparable to Witten.
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:40.840]   To take some of the most sophisticated mathematics,
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:44.640]   and not learn it to the point where
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:47.240]   he becomes a practitioner of the subject practically.
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:52.000]   And then use it to gain some new insights
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.720]   on the physics side.
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:56.120]   Now, of course the thing is that,
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:58.760]   the theories that physics, one could say,
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:00.580]   is in a sort of a crisis in some sense,
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.580]   because of a current gap between the sophisticated theories
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:11.020]   which came from applying sophisticated mathematics,
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:13.300]   and the actual universe.
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:14.800]   So we have theories, for instance,
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:17.360]   which describe 10 dimensional worlds,
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.360]   10 dimensional space time,
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.600]   coming from string theory, and things like that.
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:25.640]   But we don't know yet how to apply it
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:27.920]   to understanding our universe.
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:30.440]   A lot of progress has been made,
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.600]   but it's kind of at a kind of an impasse right now.
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:38.680]   And at the same time, our most realistic theories,
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:41.480]   most advanced theories of the four dimensional universe
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:44.840]   are in contradiction with each other.
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:48.640]   The standard model describing the three known forces
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:52.480]   of nature, electromagnetic, strong and weak,
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.120]   with great accuracy.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:55.240]   And Einstein's relativity,
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:58.200]   which describes the force called gravity.
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:00.000]   (laughing)
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.400]   Everybody above a certain age knows that one.
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:05.640]   (laughing)
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.480]   So these two theories are in contradiction at the moment.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:11.520]   And string theory was one of the,
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:13.000]   the promise of string theory was that
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.840]   it would unify those two.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:17.660]   And so far it has not happened.
[02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:20.600]   So we are kind of at a very interesting place right now.
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:24.720]   And I think that new ideas perhaps are needed.
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:27.120]   And I wouldn't be surprised if Witten
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:29.840]   is one of those people who come up with those ideas.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:33.400]   - Well he has been one of the people
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.520]   that added a lot of ideas under the flag of string theory.
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:40.040]   What do you think about this theory?
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:42.840]   What do you think is beautiful about it, string theory?
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.060]   - Well first of all, kind of,
[02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:49.400]   you remember we talked about Pythagoreans.
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.480]   And how for Pythagoreans,
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:54.560]   the whole world was this symphony
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:57.880]   where you have these different vibrations of all the humans.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.840]   Every human is a vibration, every animal,
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:02.880]   you know, every being, every tree,
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:05.400]   and every celestial body and so on.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.920]   So string theory is kind of like that
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:09.400]   because in string theory there is this fundamental object
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:10.800]   which is a vibrating string.
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:15.400]   And all particles are in a sense supposed to be
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:18.800]   different modulations or vibrations of that string.
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:20.800]   So that by itself is already interesting.
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:25.320]   That you kind of describe this diversity
[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:27.880]   of various particles and interactions between them
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:30.640]   using one guiding principle in some sense.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.380]   But also just the mathematical things that come out of it.
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:39.280]   It looks impossible to satisfy various constraints
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:42.320]   and then there is sort of like a unique way to do it.
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.760]   So that's sort of the,
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:47.840]   every time that happens when you have some system
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.040]   over, like over determined system.
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:53.960]   Let's suppose you have to do like five interviews
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:57.040]   in one day and you wake up in the morning
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.000]   and you're like, that's impossible.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.240]   Because then so many things have to align.
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:03.520]   For instance, let's suppose you have to go
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:05.940]   from one place to another, so then you have a commute
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:08.160]   and then who knows, maybe there is a traffic jam
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:09.400]   and stuff like that.
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:12.680]   And now suppose that it all works seamlessly
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:14.320]   and there were like a bunch of places
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.560]   where it could have gone hopelessly wrong and it didn't.
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:22.120]   And then in the evening you're like, wow, it worked.
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:23.680]   That's beautiful, right?
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:27.600]   That's kind of like great luck, you know, we would say.
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:30.880]   But in science this happens sometimes.
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:33.400]   That you have this theory which is not supposed to work
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:36.640]   because there's so many seemingly contradictory demands
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:39.520]   on it and yet there is a sweet spot
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:41.200]   where they balance each other.
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:43.720]   So string theory is kind of like this.
[02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:47.160]   The unfortunate aspect of it is that it balances itself
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:49.000]   in 10 dimensions and not in four.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.240]   So maybe there is another universe somewhere.
[02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:58.080]   But see, as a mathematician, for me,
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:29:59.760]   all spaces are created equal.
[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:02.340]   10 dimensional, four dimensional.
[02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:04.120]   So mathematicians love string theory
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:07.440]   because it has given us so much food for thought.
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:13.320]   - But do you think it's a correct or a wrong way
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:17.960]   or a incorrect theory for understanding this reality?
[02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:20.440]   So it might be a theory that explains
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:23.120]   some 10th dimensional reality in some other universe,
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:26.200]   but is it potentially, what do you think are the odds?
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:29.000]   Again, financial advice, you are to bet.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.480]   What do you think are the odds that it gets us closer
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:35.800]   to understanding this reality?
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:39.760]   - Well, in the form that it is now, that seems unlikely.
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:42.200]   But it could well be that based on these ideas
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:46.000]   with some modifications, with some essential new elements,
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.720]   it could work out.
[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:50.520]   So I would say right now it doesn't look so good
[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:53.940]   from the point of view of what we know.
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:57.280]   But maybe somebody will come and introduce
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.480]   square root of negative number.
[02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:00.560]   I mean, they already introduced,
[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:02.780]   but I mean kind of like as a metaphor.
[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:06.600]   Maybe somebody will come and say, what if we do this?
[02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:07.520]   It looks crazy.
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:11.600]   Speaking of Niels Bohr, he had this famous quote
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:12.940]   that he said to somebody,
[02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:16.680]   "There is no doubt that your theory is crazy.
[02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:19.960]   "The question is whether it's crazy enough
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.640]   "to describe reality."
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.560]   So that's where we are kind of.
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:26.360]   - Speaking of crazy and crazy enough,
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:31.360]   let me ask for therapy, for advice, for wisdom
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:36.880]   in returning to Eric Weinstein
[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:39.640]   and maybe give some guidance to understanding
[02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:45.360]   his view on his attempt at a theory of everything
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.160]   that he calls geometric unity,
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.160]   that he told me that you may have
[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:52.200]   some inkling of an understanding of.
[02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:54.700]   If you were to describe this theory
[02:31:54.700 --> 02:31:56.380]   to aliens that visited Earth,
[02:31:56.380 --> 02:32:00.460]   how would you do it?
[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:04.280]   Or you could try if it was just me visiting Earth,
[02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:08.320]   how would you describe it, your best understanding of it?
[02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:10.880]   - He shared with me some of it
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:13.860]   when I was in New York at Columbia, like 11 years ago.
[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:16.320]   We actually spent a lot of time where he explained to me,
[02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:17.580]   and I found it beautiful.
[02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:23.480]   He has a very original idea at the core of it,
[02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:25.380]   where you have this, instead of four-dimensional,
[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:29.080]   instead of 10-dimensional, he has 14-dimensional space.
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:32.200]   And I thought it was really original.
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:35.680]   And this exactly goes to the point I made earlier
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:36.980]   that we need new ideas.
[02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:40.880]   I feel that without some fundamentally new idea,
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:43.460]   we won't be able to get closer
[02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:45.960]   to understanding our universe.
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.940]   Now, I have a problem with the whole idea
[02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:49.140]   of theory of everything.
[02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:51.980]   I don't believe that one exists,
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:56.980]   nor that we should aim to construct one.
[02:32:56.980 --> 02:33:02.240]   And I think it's really, not to offend anybody,
[02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:04.980]   but it's ultimately a fault
[02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:07.480]   of education system of physicists.
[02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:10.800]   Like in mathematics, we're not brought up,
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:12.420]   we're not educated as mathematicians
[02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:15.580]   with the idea that one day we will come up
[02:33:15.580 --> 02:33:16.940]   with the theory of everything.
[02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:20.140]   Even though, as a joke, I said that Langlands program
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:22.200]   is mathematical theory of everything.
[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:25.460]   But I meant it as kind of a tongue-in-cheek.
[02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:28.260]   - But isn't it a little bit kind of that?
[02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:29.820]   - It's not really, because first of all,
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:32.060]   it doesn't cover all fields of mathematics,
[02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:33.980]   and it covers specific phenomena.
[02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:37.180]   - But isn't it spiritually striving
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:41.340]   towards the same platonic form of the theory of everything?
[02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:43.100]   Like connecting, connecting fields.
[02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:45.540]   - But connecting doesn't mean that it covers everything.
[02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:47.340]   So you could connect two things,
[02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:49.700]   and then you have infinitely many other things
[02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:53.180]   which are outside of the purview of this connection.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:56.520]   That's how it is in mathematics, I feel.
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:59.980]   And I would venture to say that
[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:01.780]   most mathematicians look at it this way.
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:03.100]   There's no idea that somehow,
[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:04.380]   I think it's actually impossible,
[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:06.380]   because we're not talking about such a thing
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:07.700]   as like one universe.
[02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:09.300]   We're talking about all possible universes
[02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:10.620]   of all possible dimensions and so on.
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:13.780]   It is just not feasible to have a unified,
[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:15.880]   unify everything in one equation.
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:19.380]   Now, physicists, on the other hand,
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:23.060]   have been brought up, educated for decades with this idea.
[02:34:23.060 --> 02:34:26.180]   And to me, and I am not sure I should say that,
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:29.540]   but I feel like it's kind of an ultimate ego trip.
[02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:32.260]   So that I have come up with the unified,
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:34.620]   I have found the theory of everything, it's me,
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:36.540]   and my name will be on it.
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:40.580]   I think a lot of physicists get educated this way,
[02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:43.020]   especially men take it seriously.
[02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:44.260]   And I've seen that happen,
[02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:46.160]   and I think it is counterproductive.
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:48.100]   I think that a lot of people agree
[02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:49.900]   that this debate is kind of,
[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:51.260]   I feel like it's kind of settled.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.780]   I think I hear it less and less.
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:57.260]   But I disagree with the whole premise.
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:00.100]   - So you, it's interesting,
[02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:02.500]   'cause both are interesting points you made,
[02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:04.540]   which is you don't think a theory of everything
[02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:08.380]   exists, and you don't think the pursuit
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:09.580]   of a theory of everything is good.
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:12.060]   So I think you spoke to the second thing,
[02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:15.620]   which is basically that the pursuit
[02:35:15.620 --> 02:35:17.500]   of a theory of everything becomes
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:19.300]   like a drug to the human ego.
[02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:21.740]   - That's right, so it's a huge motivating factor.
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:23.260]   I don't deny that.
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:26.340]   But I feel that there are better ways
[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:30.980]   to motivate people than like that, than this way, okay?
[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:33.980]   So I would say, for instance,
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:36.700]   if one, because then it's not a game
[02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:39.420]   of winner takes all in some sense.
[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:41.860]   And in fairness, when physicists say
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:44.620]   theory of everything, the grand unified theory,
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.060]   they mean something very specific,
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.580]   which is unifying the standard model
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:49.620]   and Einstein's relativity theory,
[02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:51.420]   which is a theory of gravity.
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:54.060]   So they don't necessarily, a lot of physicists
[02:35:54.060 --> 02:35:56.700]   may say these words, but they don't really mean them.
[02:35:56.700 --> 02:35:59.420]   I think it's important to realize that,
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:01.820]   that in my opinion, that's not productive,
[02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:03.580]   and it's not feasible anyway.
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:05.780]   So having said that, there are some theories
[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:06.940]   are better than others, obviously.
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:09.140]   So for instance, Eric's theory has,
[02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:12.260]   as far as I understand, does have a certain way
[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:15.300]   of producing some of the elementary particles
[02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:18.420]   that we see, and as well as the force of gravity.
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:20.700]   So it does have that promise.
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:23.460]   I feel that, at least from the place
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:26.900]   where I had seen it about 10 years ago,
[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:28.220]   it still required a lot of work
[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:30.340]   to get to the point of actually saying
[02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:34.220]   that it does work, because, you know,
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:35.780]   there are a lot of elements.
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:37.860]   It's a huge enterprise to have a theory,
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:41.340]   because you have, just to describe the fields,
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:43.980]   sort of the building blocks of the theory,
[02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:45.660]   it's already a tremendous undertaking,
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:48.020]   and he's trying to do it for curved spaces
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:50.340]   in greater generality, which is what makes it
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:52.300]   so unique and so beautiful.
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:54.540]   But then, on top of that, there are all these issues
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:56.820]   of quantization, of actually describing them
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:36:58.740]   as quantum field theory.
[02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:02.060]   And the quantum field theory, even as a language,
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:06.100]   as a framework, is currently incomplete, in my opinion.
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:08.500]   And not only my opinion, it's like everybody's,
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:10.220]   it's, everybody agrees on that,
[02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:15.220]   that it's a, it's a, it's a collection of tricks,
[02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:16.940]   so to speak, it's a collection of tools.
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:21.940]   It's a toolbox, but it is not a consistent,
[02:37:21.940 --> 02:37:26.420]   rigorous theory, like number theory in mathematics.
[02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:30.540]   Physicists have still been able to derive predictions
[02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:37.020]   from it, and confirm them to great accuracy,
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:41.100]   but the underpinnings, it doesn't have
[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:44.420]   the real rigorous foundation from mathematical perspective.
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:48.860]   So in that sense, even if, in that framework,
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:53.860]   a new theory could lead to an explanation of some,
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:57.300]   some new explanation of some phenomena,
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:58.980]   it would still be incomplete, in a sense,
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:00.540]   because it wouldn't be mathematically rigorous,
[02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:01.900]   you see what I mean?
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:04.220]   Because the whole framework is not yet
[02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:06.540]   on a firm foundation.
[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:07.980]   - So it's not consistent.
[02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:11.580]   Why is it that the universe should have,
[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:13.220]   so that's to your first point,
[02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:16.380]   do you think the universe has a beautiful, clean,
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:19.180]   when you show up and meet God,
[02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:21.900]   and there's one equation on the board,
[02:38:21.900 --> 02:38:23.900]   and the two of you just chuckle,
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:25.700]   do you think such equation exists?
[02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:29.980]   - Yeah, there are such equations, for instance,
[02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:34.100]   let's say I am interested in a particular question, right?
[02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:36.660]   So in the Langlands program,
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:39.780]   so moving away from physics, so let's talk about math.
[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:43.140]   So in the context of Langlands program,
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:46.980]   I have recently developed with my co-authors,
[02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:49.420]   Ettingoff and Kasdan, a kind of a new strength,
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.920]   a new flavor of the Langlands program, if you will.
[02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:57.660]   But so far, it's a vision, it's a set of conjectures,
[02:38:57.660 --> 02:38:59.180]   which we have proved in some cases,
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:01.340]   but not in full generality.
[02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:05.700]   So yes, I would like to use your framework,
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.940]   meet the creator, and ask her,
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:11.020]   (laughs)
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:13.180]   what is the explanation of this?
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:14.900]   And it may well be that she will answer
[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:16.940]   in a way that I will just burst out laughing,
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:19.380]   it's like, how could we not see it, you see?
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:21.300]   So that I totally see.
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:24.800]   But I don't see one equation governing,
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:26.980]   one equation governing them all.
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:29.780]   - Not one equation to govern them all,
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:32.920]   but it does seem that such equations exist,
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:34.400]   where she will tell you something,
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:37.140]   and you look back and say, how could I not see it?
[02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:40.580]   It seems like the truth at the end of the day is simple,
[02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:45.320]   that we're seeking, especially through mathematics.
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:47.220]   It seems somehow simple.
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:50.020]   The nature of reality, the thing that governs it
[02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:51.340]   seems to be simple.
[02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:52.460]   I wonder why that is.
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:56.300]   And I also wonder if it's not totally incorrect,
[02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:58.860]   and we're just craving the simplicity.
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:03.660]   And then, mixing into the whole conversation
[02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:07.500]   about how much the observer that craves simplicity
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:09.620]   is part of the answer.
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:13.020]   It's a whole big, giant mess.
[02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:18.900]   - Or a whole big, beautiful painting, or symphony.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.400]   You said of Eric Weinstein that,
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.320]   "I find it remarkable that Eric was able to come up
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:26.580]   "with such beautiful and original ideas,
[02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:29.460]   "even though he has been out of academia for so long,
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.120]   "doing wonderful things in other areas,
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:33.540]   "such as economics and finance."
[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:35.580]   I'd like to use that kind of quote
[02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:38.020]   as just a question to you about different places
[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:42.220]   where people of your level can operate,
[02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:45.460]   so inside academia and outside.
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:49.600]   What is the difference of doing mathematics
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:51.240]   inside academia and outside?
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:54.320]   Not even mathematics,
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:56.400]   but developing beautiful, original ideas.
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:03.000]   Where's the place that your imagination can flourish most?
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.720]   So the limitations of academia is,
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:11.120]   there's a community of people that take a set of axioms
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:14.360]   as gospel, so it's harder to take that leap
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:16.980]   into the unknown, but it's also,
[02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:18.420]   the nice thing about academia
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:21.860]   is some of the most brilliant people in the world are there.
[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:24.380]   It's that community, both the competition
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:25.940]   and the collaboration is there.
[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:29.380]   I wonder if there's something you could say
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:33.060]   sort of to further about this world
[02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:35.700]   that people might not be familiar with.
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:38.020]   - But I think you gave a very good description.
[02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:40.020]   I'm not sure I can improve on it,
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:42.500]   because I don't have an overarching theory of--
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:44.100]   - Academia. - Academia.
[02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:46.240]   I definitely have been part of it,
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:49.480]   and I'm grateful, because it gives you
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:51.020]   a great sense of security,
[02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:55.440]   which comes with its own downside, too,
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:57.400]   because you kind of get a little disconnected
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.900]   from the real world, because you get tenure,
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:01.960]   so you feel financially secure.
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:03.960]   You know, they don't pay you that much, so to speak,
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:05.080]   you know, relatively speaking,
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:08.680]   and it's comfortable, but it's not that much,
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:13.200]   but you can't be fired, so there is something about this
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:16.800]   which I definitely have benefit from it, you know,
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:20.480]   and it does, people are not even aware
[02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:23.080]   what it's like to live outside of,
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:26.320]   where you don't have this type of security.
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:29.400]   On the other hand, that also means
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:31.240]   that we're lacking certain skills
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:33.520]   that sort of real people in the real world
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:37.080]   have developed out of necessity
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:39.800]   to deal with that sort of insecurity.
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:41.720]   So it kind of always cuts both ways.
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:43.120]   You know, on the one hand, it gives,
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:45.160]   and on the other hand, it takes away,
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:47.120]   and it's a very interesting setup,
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:48.720]   and also, on the one hand,
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:51.840]   we are all supposed to be the truth seekers,
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:55.440]   but in reality, of course, it is a human activity,
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:57.400]   and it is a human community,
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:00.360]   and it was all kinds of good, bad, and ugly things
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:02.760]   that happen, a lot of them under the radar screen,
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:07.760]   so to speak, and so, but maybe there is something to it.
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:10.120]   There is definitely, there are definitely people
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:14.800]   who are upholding kind of that old tradition, definitely,
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:18.720]   and that is inspiring, and I aspire to be one of those,
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.640]   do my best, so whether this is a system
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:26.520]   that will stay or should stay, I don't know.
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:27.360]   I really don't know.
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:28.200]   - That's really fascinating.
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:31.360]   Yeah, it's fascinating what, especially with,
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:35.280]   just to introduce the bit of AI poison into the mix,
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:38.920]   as that changes the nature of education, perhaps, as well,
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:40.600]   what the role of the university is
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:43.960]   in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years, I wonder.
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:49.000]   I wonder, and I wonder that, you know,
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.840]   how do you make sense that Einstein was working,
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.360]   after attempting, I believe, to be a university professor,
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:57.840]   was, did most of-- - He was in the patent office.
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:43:59.960]   - Yeah, as a patent clerk.
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:01.720]   - But I have to say, to these days,
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:06.800]   the science has become so much faster.
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:09.720]   It is really hard to do it being outside.
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:12.520]   Now, Eric is unique in this way,
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:17.120]   even though he did go to great undergraduate
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:20.440]   and graduate schools,
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:24.140]   but, and then worked for a while in academia.
[02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:27.800]   There are very few examples like this.
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:29.320]   There's Yutong Zhang, who proved
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:32.800]   the important conjecture number theory about 10 years ago,
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:34.560]   and is now, as I understand,
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.960]   is a professor at UC Santa Barbara.
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:38.600]   He worked outside of academia
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:42.620]   and was able to make a tremendous advance on his own.
[02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:45.500]   This case is exceedingly rare,
[02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:49.400]   in part because academia is trying to protect its turf,
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:51.800]   and it's kind of, it's creating
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:55.200]   this sort of prohibitive cost of an outsider.
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:58.680]   That is true, but there is also something about
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.560]   how much concentration.
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:03.280]   In mathematics, I don't think people
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:06.120]   who are not in the field understand
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.040]   what kind of focus and concentration
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:12.560]   actually doing, like, mathematics
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:16.920]   at the top level these days requires,
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:18.600]   because we're not talking about something
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:20.800]   that is more or less good.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:22.440]   It is something which is unassailable.
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:25.020]   You know, it's finding this treasure
[02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:26.840]   at the bottom of the ocean, you know,
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:30.600]   without, you know, the aqualung, you know,
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:32.560]   without oxygen.
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:34.720]   And that's why, you know,
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:38.120]   it's not, people go crazy sometimes, you know?
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:39.200]   But there is a reason for that.
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:40.880]   - Well, let me ask about that,
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:42.560]   sort of just to linger on that,
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.640]   the amount of concentration required.
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:49.400]   Cal Newport wrote a book called Deep Work,
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.500]   and he's a theoretical computer scientist.
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:57.920]   He took quite seriously the task
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:45:59.600]   of allocating the hours in the day
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:01.220]   for that kind of deep thinking,
[02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:03.800]   and then the mathematician is theoretical
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.080]   computer scientist on steroids.
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:09.880]   So for your own life and what you've observed,
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:15.240]   let me ask the big question, how to think,
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:17.120]   how to think deeply,
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:19.580]   how to find the mental, psychological,
[02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:24.260]   pragmatic space to really sit there and think deeply.
[02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:26.800]   How do you do it?
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:28.120]   In the moments you remember
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:29.720]   where you really deeply thought,
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:34.840]   what, was it an accident, was it deliberate?
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:37.720]   - No, it's deliberate because, you know,
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:43.760]   first of all, my first years as a mathematician, you know,
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:50.760]   I worked every day, weekends, holidays, doesn't matter.
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:54.300]   I didn't even question that,
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:58.640]   so I would feel something's missing if I took a day off.
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:00.040]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:05.040]   - And, you know, so it was just a kind of a sustained effort.
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:08.880]   The point is that still the process is nonlinear,
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:11.480]   to go back to what we discussed earlier,
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:13.920]   that, in other words, the way I see it
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:18.920]   is you are making an effort to bring all the information
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:22.900]   into focus, what you believe is correct,
[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:27.900]   and you're playing with different ways of connecting things.
[02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:31.500]   But it is a total miracle
[02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:35.700]   when suddenly there is inside strikes.
[02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:38.020]   It is not something that, in my experience,
[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:41.820]   could be predicted or even anticipated,
[02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:44.060]   you know, or like brought closer.
[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:48.020]   There is a famous story about Einstein
[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:50.700]   that he used to, you know, go think, think, think,
[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:52.100]   and then go for a walk,
[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:53.860]   and like he would whistle sometimes.
[02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:56.740]   So I remember the first time I heard this story,
[02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:57.940]   I thought, "Mm, how interesting.
[02:47:57.940 --> 02:47:59.780]   "So what a coincidence that this came to him
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:01.260]   "when he was whistling."
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:02.180]   But in fact, it's not.
[02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:04.860]   This is how it works in some sense,
[02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:07.620]   that you have to prepare for it,
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:10.260]   but then it happens when you stop thinking, actually.
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:14.660]   So the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops,
[02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:19.660]   and you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking.
[02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:25.220]   But you cannot do it by will in some sense.
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:27.780]   It's kind of like, you know how in the Eastern tradition
[02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:29.340]   they have this concept of satori,
[02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:31.820]   like in Zen Buddhism you have this satori,
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:33.820]   which is enlightenment.
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:38.500]   And so there are various reports of Buddhist monks
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:41.380]   or Buddhist masters who have had experience satori.
[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:47.780]   But they say you can't do it by will.
[02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:49.940]   You cannot make it happen.
[02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:52.860]   If anything, you have to relax to let it come to you.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:54.100]   It's kind of like that.
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:54.940]   It's kind of like that.
[02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:59.940]   So I think that what matters,
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:01.580]   but you say how to think.
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:05.220]   The point is that we're talking about such an esoteric area.
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:07.060]   Mathematics is really an esoteric area.
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:08.900]   It's a really strange subject
[02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:12.500]   where you try to fit everything
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.380]   in this very, very stringent set of rules,
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:18.180]   to obey those rules.
[02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:20.740]   - Isn't it basically the pure,
[02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:23.180]   the hardest manifestation of a puzzle
[02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:25.100]   that we're all solving in different other disciplines,
[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:27.380]   but this is the hardest puzzle?
[02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:30.020]   - Yes and no, because there is just a different,
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:33.100]   for instance, there is a different criterion
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.360]   for what constitutes progress.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:38.540]   For instance, physics, a lot of arguments they make,
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:40.820]   they are not rigorous from mathematical perspective.
[02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:42.540]   It is kind of an intuitive argument.
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:43.820]   We think it is like this.
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:47.460]   And this is acceptable in the subject, for a good reason.
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:49.660]   And so there is some play.
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:53.140]   It's more like human activity, day-to-day activity.
[02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:55.460]   For instance, if you and I discuss something,
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:57.020]   you have an idea and I have an idea,
[02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.420]   and we argue about it,
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:00.780]   and something seems more plausible,
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:02.500]   something seems less plausible.
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:05.060]   And so we may decide to take this point of view
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:07.220]   or that point of view as a provisional
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:10.800]   sort of like point of view and go with it.
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:13.780]   In mathematics, it doesn't work this way.
[02:50:13.780 --> 02:50:15.620]   You either prove it or you don't.
[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:19.380]   And oftentimes, you get to the point
[02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:21.540]   where there is this much you need to prove,
[02:50:21.540 --> 02:50:25.060]   and it just wouldn't come to you.
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:26.660]   And you just don't see it.
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:29.000]   And it can go on for months.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.940]   Super frustrating.
[02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:35.740]   But without it, it is nothing, kind of.
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:37.820]   - I would love to hear your opinion,
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.980]   to the degree that you know it,
[02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:43.540]   of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles,
[02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:48.540]   which seems to have this element, perhaps for years.
[02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:49.740]   To the degree that you know,
[02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:52.620]   perhaps can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem
[02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:54.740]   and what your thoughts are in the process
[02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:57.140]   that Andrew Wiles took that seemed to,
[02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:59.220]   at least from my sort of romantic perspective,
[02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:01.220]   seemed to be very lonely.
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:03.480]   - Yes, it's a lonely profession.
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:05.380]   - And hopeless.
[02:51:05.380 --> 02:51:13.960]   You put it really nicely because it feels like
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:16.020]   there's a lot of moments where you feel like you're close.
[02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:17.340]   - You feel like 99% is done.
[02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:18.180]   - Yeah.
[02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:20.020]   - But there's one stubborn thing
[02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:23.660]   which just does not compute, you know, doesn't happen.
[02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:28.300]   And you're trying to find that push for this last link.
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:30.340]   And it could take,
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.100]   and nobody knows how long it's going to take.
[02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:34.700]   - Would it be useful to maybe try to explain
[02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:35.780]   Fermat's Last Theorem?
[02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:37.380]   - Sure, it's easy to do.
[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:39.140]   (laughing)
[02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:41.380]   I am an optimist, I am an optimist.
[02:51:41.380 --> 02:51:44.940]   I think, I always think that everything can be explained.
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:47.760]   Even though I say that not everything can be explained.
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:50.580]   But in mathematics, you know,
[02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:52.060]   within this particular framework,
[02:51:52.060 --> 02:51:54.620]   I think that I always feel optimistic
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:57.180]   when people ask me to explain something.
[02:51:57.180 --> 02:51:58.460]   I always start with the assumption
[02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:01.340]   that they will understand, you know?
[02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:03.140]   So, let's try.
[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:06.540]   Fermat's Last Theorem,
[02:52:06.540 --> 02:52:10.500]   one of the jewels sort of of mathematics of all time.
[02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:13.820]   A beautiful story also behind it.
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:16.760]   Pierre Fermat, a great French mathematician
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:18.580]   who lived in the beginning of,
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:22.820]   mostly worked at the beginning of, what, 17th century.
[02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:26.020]   And he actually has to his credit
[02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:28.620]   a number of important contributions.
[02:52:28.620 --> 02:52:31.260]   But the most famous is called Fermat's Last Theorem,
[02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:33.380]   or Fermat's Great Theorem.
[02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:35.900]   And the reason why it became so famous
[02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:38.580]   is in part because he actually claimed
[02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:40.860]   to have proved it himself.
[02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:44.420]   And he did it on the margin of a book that he was reading,
[02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:46.700]   which was actually an important book by Diophantus,
[02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:51.340]   about equations with coefficients in whole numbers.
[02:52:51.340 --> 02:52:53.460]   And he wrote on the margin, literally,
[02:52:53.460 --> 02:52:57.040]   this equation, this problem,
[02:52:57.040 --> 02:52:58.680]   which I will explain in a moment,
[02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:02.940]   I have solved it, I have found a proof,
[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:05.340]   but this margin is too small to contain it.
[02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:09.700]   At some point, I was giving a public talk about this,
[02:53:09.700 --> 02:53:12.480]   and I made, as a joke, I made a tweet
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:14.920]   in which I wrote that I have proved this theorem,
[02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:16.860]   but 280 characters are not enough,
[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:18.660]   and it kind of cuts me in mid-sentence.
[02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:22.980]   So this was 17th century Twitter-style proof, okay?
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:24.700]   But a lot of mathematicians took it seriously
[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:27.020]   because he had great credibility,
[02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:32.020]   he did make some major contributions.
[02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:33.380]   And the search was on.
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:37.300]   So for 350 years, about 350 years,
[02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:41.140]   it remained unproved,
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:44.700]   with many people trying and failing
[02:53:44.700 --> 02:53:49.500]   until in 1994, no, in 1993,
[02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:51.660]   Andrew Wiles announced,
[02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:53.980]   a mathematician from Princeton University,
[02:53:53.980 --> 02:53:56.420]   announced the proof, and it was very exciting
[02:53:56.420 --> 02:54:00.540]   because he was one of the top number theorists in the world.
[02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:04.260]   And unfortunately, about a year later, a gap was found.
[02:54:04.260 --> 02:54:06.540]   So this is exactly what we were talking about earlier.
[02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:07.980]   You have 99% of the proof,
[02:54:07.980 --> 02:54:11.040]   this one little thing does not quite connect,
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:12.760]   and this nullifies the whole thing.
[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:13.800]   Even though, well, you could say
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:15.040]   there are some interesting ideas,
[02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:18.540]   but it's not the same as actually having a proof.
[02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:20.320]   So he apparently was really frustrated,
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:22.840]   and he was really, a lot of people thought
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:26.060]   that it's going to be another 100 years or whatever.
[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:28.760]   And then luckily, he was able to enlist,
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:33.400]   with the help, assistance of his former student,
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:35.840]   also great number theorist, Richard Taylor,
[02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:38.920]   they were able to do that 1%, so to speak.
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:40.760]   Well, some people might say it may be not 1%,
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:41.780]   but 5% or whatever,
[02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:44.240]   but it definitely was an important ingredient,
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:48.560]   but it was not, he had a sort of like a big new set of ideas,
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:50.480]   and this one thing didn't pan out.
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:52.600]   They were able to close it with Taylor,
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:54.160]   and it finally was published,
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:57.360]   and I think was accepted and refereed in '95,
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:54:59.900]   and is believed to be correct.
[02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:06.840]   Now, what he proved actually was not Fermat's theorem itself,
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:09.360]   but a certain statement,
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:12.340]   which is called Shimura-Taniyama-Wei conjecture,
[02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:13.740]   named after three mathematicians,
[02:55:13.740 --> 02:55:17.380]   two Japanese mathematicians and one French-born mathematician
[02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:19.820]   who worked also at the Institute for Advanced Study
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:21.800]   in Princeton.
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:25.740]   And it was my colleague at UC Berkeley, Ken Ribbit,
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:28.520]   who in the '80s connected the two problems.
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:30.660]   So this is how it often works in mathematics.
[02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:32.740]   You want to prove statement A.
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:36.020]   Instead, you prove that A is equivalent to B.
[02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:37.620]   So after that, if you can prove B,
[02:55:37.620 --> 02:55:40.160]   this would automatically imply that A is correct.
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:41.640]   So this is what happened here.
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:42.880]   A was Fermat's last theorem,
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:44.960]   B was Shimura-Taniyama-Wei conjecture,
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:48.000]   and that's what Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:49.240]   really proved.
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:51.440]   So it requires, to get to Fermat's last theorem,
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:52.400]   it requires that bridge,
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:53.960]   which was established by my colleague,
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:56.400]   Ken Ribbit, at UC Berkeley.
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:59.100]   So now, what is the statement of Fermat's last theorem?
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:03.000]   Let me start with Pythagoras,
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:04.200]   since we already talked about it.
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:06.920]   Let me start with Pythagoras' theorem,
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.020]   which describes the right triangles.
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:11.260]   So what is the right triangle?
[02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:14.420]   It's a triangle in which one of the angles is 90 degrees,
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:15.900]   like this.
[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:17.420]   So it has three sides.
[02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:20.220]   The longer side is called hypotenuse,
[02:56:20.220 --> 02:56:21.680]   and then there's two other sides.
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:25.860]   So if we denote the lengths of hypotenuse by z,
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:28.540]   and the two other sides, x and y,
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:31.240]   then z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared.
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:34.060]   So that's the equation,
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:36.520]   or x squared plus y squared equals z squared.
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:41.160]   And it turns out that this equation
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:44.080]   has solutions in natural numbers.
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:47.840]   Many, actually infinitely many solutions in natural numbers.
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:50.980]   For example, if x is, you take x equals three,
[02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:54.360]   y equals four, and z equals five,
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:58.160]   then they solve this equation,
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:00.540]   because three squared is nine,
[02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:03.120]   four squared is 16.
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:06.340]   Nine plus 16, 25.
[02:57:06.340 --> 02:57:07.600]   And that's five squared.
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.880]   So x squared plus y squared equals z squared
[02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:15.880]   is solved by x equals three, y equals four, z equals five.
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:18.440]   And there are many other solutions of that nature.
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:19.960]   - And we should say that natural numbers
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:23.320]   are whole numbers that are non-negative.
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:24.160]   - That's right.
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:26.040]   One, two, three, four, five, six, and so on.
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:27.640]   Now, what's Fermat's last theorem?
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:29.840]   Fermat asked, what about,
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.560]   what will happen if we replace squares by cubes, for example?
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:36.920]   So x cubed plus y cubed equals z cubed.
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:41.160]   Are there any solutions in,
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:43.160]   what do you call, natural numbers?
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:46.720]   It turns out there are none.
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:48.000]   What about fourth powers?
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000]   Again, none.
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.800]   - Well, it seems like none, right?
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:53.960]   - So that was the statement.
[02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:57.200]   So this theorem says that the equation
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:57:59.860]   x cubed plus y cubed equals z cubed
[02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:01.900]   has no solutions in natural numbers.
[02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:06.900]   Remember, natural means positive whole numbers.
[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:09.100]   So of course there is a trivial solution, zero, zero, zero,
[02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:12.100]   so that this works, but you need all of them to be positive.
[02:58:12.100 --> 02:58:17.100]   X to the fourth plus y to the fourth equals z to the fourth
[02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:18.600]   also has no solutions.
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:23.940]   X to the fifth plus y to the fifth equals z to the fifth,
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:26.140]   no solutions, so you kind of see the trend.
[02:58:26.140 --> 02:58:30.740]   X to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.220]   If n is greater than two,
[02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:35.180]   has no solutions in natural numbers.
[02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:38.300]   That is a statement of Fermat's last theorem.
[02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:42.180]   Deceptively simple as far as famous theorems are concerned.
[02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:45.340]   You don't need to know anything beyond standard arithmetic,
[02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:48.240]   addition and multiplication of natural numbers.
[02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:49.580]   That's why a lot of people,
[02:58:49.580 --> 02:58:54.440]   both specialists and amateurs,
[02:58:54.440 --> 02:58:56.260]   try to prove it.
[02:58:56.260 --> 02:58:57.100]   - It's so tempting.
[02:58:57.100 --> 02:58:59.300]   - It's so tempting, it's so easy to formulate.
[02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:03.620]   So in fact I think Fermat proved the case of cubes.
[02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:05.900]   I think he did actually prove some elsewhere,
[02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:08.740]   the case of cubes, but so it remained like fourth.
[02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:10.020]   There are infinitely many cases, right?
[02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:11.700]   You have to, even if you prove it for cubes
[02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:12.900]   and for fourth power and fifth,
[02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:15.140]   then still there's sixth, seventh and so on.
[02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:18.140]   There are infinitely many cases in which it has to be proved.
[02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:24.460]   And so you see, the deceptively simple result
[02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:26.360]   took 350 years to prove.
[02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:30.500]   And, but in a sense it's like mathematicians,
[02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:33.100]   you would think mathematics is such a sterile profession.
[02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:35.140]   Everybody's so serious,
[02:59:35.140 --> 02:59:37.500]   almost like we're all wearing lab coats
[02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:42.500]   and take an elevator to the ivory tower.
[02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:45.560]   However, look at all this drama.
[02:59:45.560 --> 02:59:46.400]   Look at all this drama.
[02:59:46.400 --> 02:59:47.900]   It's like we also like drama.
[02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:49.420]   We also have narratives.
[02:59:49.420 --> 02:59:51.040]   We also have our myths.
[02:59:51.040 --> 02:59:54.880]   Here is a guy, he's a 16th century mathematician
[02:59:54.880 --> 02:59:56.380]   or 17th century mathematician
[02:59:56.380 --> 02:59:58.820]   who leaves a note on the margin
[02:59:58.820 --> 03:00:01.460]   and motivates others to find the proof.
[03:00:01.460 --> 03:00:03.900]   Then how many hearts were broken
[03:00:03.900 --> 03:00:05.700]   that they believe that they found the proof
[03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:09.540]   and then later it was realized that the proof was incorrect
[03:00:09.540 --> 03:00:12.460]   and so on and brings us to modern day.
[03:00:12.460 --> 03:00:14.900]   And one last attempt, Andrew Wiles,
[03:00:14.900 --> 03:00:16.940]   who is very serious and respected
[03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:19.120]   and esteemed mathematician announces the proof
[03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:21.380]   only to be faced with the same reality
[03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:24.140]   of his hopes dashed, seemingly dashed.
[03:00:24.140 --> 03:00:27.140]   And like there is a mistake, it doesn't work.
[03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:29.300]   And then to be able to recover a year later,
[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:31.780]   how much drama in this one story, huh?
[03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:32.620]   - It's amazing.
[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:36.040]   But from what you understand, from what you know,
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:37.940]   what was the process for him
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:40.860]   that is similar perhaps to your own life
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:47.220]   of walking along with the problem for months, not years?
[03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:49.820]   - Yes, so he worked,
[03:00:49.820 --> 03:00:52.780]   he has given interviews about it afterwards.
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:55.900]   So we know that he described his process,
[03:00:55.900 --> 03:00:58.940]   that number one, he did not want to tell anybody
[03:00:58.940 --> 03:01:02.180]   because he was afraid that people find out
[03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:03.380]   that he's working on it.
[03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:08.140]   Because he was such a top level mathematician,
[03:01:08.140 --> 03:01:10.540]   people would guess that he has some idea,
[03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:11.380]   that there is some idea.
[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:16.380]   So, you know, if you just know that somebody has an idea,
[03:01:16.380 --> 03:01:19.900]   this already gives you a great boost of confidence, right?
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:23.340]   So he didn't want people to have that information.
[03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:25.500]   So he didn't tell anybody that he was working on it,
[03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:27.140]   number one. - Must be lonely.
[03:01:27.140 --> 03:01:29.500]   - Number two, he worked on it for seven years,
[03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:32.660]   if I remember correctly, by himself.
[03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:37.660]   And then he thought he had it and he was elated.
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:40.700]   Obviously, he was, you know, very happy.
[03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:42.940]   And he announced it at a conference,
[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:44.460]   I think it was in Cambridge University
[03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:48.700]   or Oxford University in the UK in 1993, I believe.
[03:01:48.700 --> 03:01:53.700]   So, you know, this is really interesting
[03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:59.060]   because all of us, all mathematicians can relate to this
[03:01:59.060 --> 03:02:02.100]   because I remember very well my first problem,
[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:03.600]   how I solved my first problem.
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:07.860]   I describe it in "Love and Math" in my book.
[03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:12.340]   So it was, how old was I?
[03:02:12.340 --> 03:02:16.620]   I was 18 years old, I was a student in Moscow,
[03:02:16.620 --> 03:02:19.540]   and I just lucked out that I was introduced
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:21.180]   to this great mathematician.
[03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:24.540]   Since I was not studying at Moscow University
[03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:26.500]   because of antisemitism in the Soviet Union,
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:28.380]   so I was in this technical school,
[03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:30.660]   but I was lucky that I had a mathematician
[03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:32.020]   who took me under his wing,
[03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:38.900]   and Dmitry Fuchs, who actually later came to the US,
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:42.220]   and he's still a professor at UC Davis, actually.
[03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:44.560]   Not so far from me.
[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:50.140]   So he gave me this problem, and it was rather technical,
[03:02:50.140 --> 03:02:51.780]   so I will not try to describe it,
[03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:56.780]   but I do remember how much effort, that excitement,
[03:02:56.780 --> 03:02:58.580]   but also kind of a fear.
[03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:00.540]   What if I don't have what it takes?
[03:03:00.540 --> 03:03:01.380]   You know?
[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:04.500]   I lost sleep, so this was one consequence of this.
[03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:07.860]   For the first time in my life, I had trouble falling asleep,
[03:03:07.860 --> 03:03:11.140]   and this actually stayed for a couple years afterwards.
[03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:12.860]   So then it was kind of like a wake-up call
[03:03:12.860 --> 03:03:14.700]   that I should be, take care of myself,
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:16.180]   not work too late, and so on.
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:18.720]   So that was sort of like that experience.
[03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:21.340]   And I was lucky that I was able to find a solution,
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:24.040]   number one, within two months, maybe.
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:27.700]   And it was surprising, and it was beautiful.
[03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:29.900]   The answer was in terms of something
[03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:31.820]   which seemed to be from a different world,
[03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:34.180]   from a different area of mathematics.
[03:03:34.180 --> 03:03:35.860]   So I was very happy.
[03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:39.940]   But I do remember this moment when suddenly you see that.
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:43.380]   In this case, it was literally,
[03:03:43.380 --> 03:03:45.660]   I had to compile these diagrams
[03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:48.380]   with what mathematicians call cohomology groups
[03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:49.900]   and spectral sequences,
[03:03:49.900 --> 03:03:53.580]   and manually calculate some numbers,
[03:03:53.580 --> 03:03:55.860]   and trying to discern some system in it.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:57.380]   And suddenly I saw that,
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:01.260]   how they all were governed by this one force,
[03:04:01.260 --> 03:04:03.180]   so to speak, one pattern.
[03:04:03.180 --> 03:04:05.580]   And that was absolutely wow.
[03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:07.580]   So it's like. (laughs)
[03:04:07.580 --> 03:04:08.400]   - I mean, what was it?
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:10.460]   So you were sitting there at a desk.
[03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:13.060]   - Actually, you know, I lived in a town outside of Moscow,
[03:04:13.060 --> 03:04:15.780]   so I used to take, I would take a train to Moscow.
[03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:17.580]   So it's what we call in Russia, elektrichka,
[03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:20.420]   you know, like this electric train, which was super slow.
[03:04:20.420 --> 03:04:23.060]   It took more than two hours to cover that distance.
[03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:24.700]   And I think that the crucial insight came
[03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:26.640]   when I was in this.
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:29.220]   And I just, I had to contain myself
[03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:30.540]   so I don't start screaming, you know,
[03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:34.780]   because there were other passengers in the car.
[03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:39.060]   So I was sitting there and staring at this paper.
[03:04:39.060 --> 03:04:43.060]   So you know what I remember that what came to me?
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:47.180]   I have something now which nobody else in the world has.
[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:49.060]   I have a proof of, first of all, I did not,
[03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:50.180]   it was not just a proof.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:53.300]   Like in the case of Fermat, the statement is already made.
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:54.820]   That's why it's called conjecture, you know.
[03:04:54.820 --> 03:04:57.220]   You make a statement, you don't have a proof yet.
[03:04:57.220 --> 03:04:58.180]   Then you try to prove it.
[03:04:58.180 --> 03:05:00.420]   In my case, I did not know what the answer would be.
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:03.860]   There was a type of question where the answer was unknown.
[03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:06.420]   So I had to find the answer and prove it.
[03:05:06.420 --> 03:05:08.060]   And the answer was very nice.
[03:05:08.060 --> 03:05:09.980]   So nobody knew, as far as I could tell,
[03:05:09.980 --> 03:05:12.740]   nobody knew because my teacher told me
[03:05:12.740 --> 03:05:14.820]   that he explored all the literature.
[03:05:14.820 --> 03:05:15.820]   This was not known.
[03:05:15.820 --> 03:05:22.100]   Suddenly I felt that I was in possession of this.
[03:05:22.100 --> 03:05:24.980]   Now, it was a little thing.
[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:27.060]   It was not cure for cancer.
[03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:30.100]   It was not a large language model.
[03:05:30.100 --> 03:05:36.200]   But it was something undeniably real, meaningful,
[03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:37.540]   and it was mine, kind of.
[03:05:37.540 --> 03:05:38.980]   You know, like I had it, nobody else.
[03:05:38.980 --> 03:05:39.860]   I had not published it yet.
[03:05:39.860 --> 03:05:42.180]   I hadn't even told anybody.
[03:05:42.180 --> 03:05:45.340]   And it is a very strange feeling to have that.
[03:05:45.340 --> 03:05:48.780]   - Were you worried that this treasure could be stolen?
[03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:50.660]   - Not at the time, not at the time.
[03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:52.500]   So later on, there were situations
[03:05:52.500 --> 03:05:55.300]   where I was exposed to those type of experiences.
[03:05:55.300 --> 03:05:56.620]   By that time, I didn't think of that.
[03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:59.940]   I was still this starry-eyed kid
[03:05:59.940 --> 03:06:02.820]   who was just obsessed with mathematics,
[03:06:02.820 --> 03:06:06.740]   with this beauty and discovering those beautiful facts,
[03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:08.260]   beautiful results.
[03:06:08.260 --> 03:06:09.760]   So I didn't think about,
[03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:11.580]   I didn't even think that it could be possible
[03:06:11.580 --> 03:06:13.580]   that somebody could steal it or whatever.
[03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:15.860]   I just wanted to share it with my teacher
[03:06:15.860 --> 03:06:17.620]   as soon as possible, you know?
[03:06:17.620 --> 03:06:19.940]   And he understood quickly,
[03:06:19.940 --> 03:06:22.940]   and he's like, "Yeah, good job," you know?
[03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:26.260]   - Is there something you can give color to the drama?
[03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:30.860]   Eric Weinstein has spoken about some of the challenges,
[03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:34.740]   some of the triumphs and challenges of his time at Harvard.
[03:06:34.740 --> 03:06:39.740]   So is there something to that drama
[03:06:39.740 --> 03:06:42.900]   of people stealing each other's ideas
[03:06:42.900 --> 03:06:45.500]   or not allocating credit enough?
[03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:46.980]   - Oh, sure, yes.
[03:06:46.980 --> 03:06:50.020]   - All of that and creating psychological stresses
[03:06:50.020 --> 03:06:50.980]   because of that.
[03:06:50.980 --> 03:06:53.100]   - Happens all the time, yes, unfortunately.
[03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:54.900]   - On young minds and so on.
[03:06:54.900 --> 03:06:57.020]   - Could have a very bad effect.
[03:06:57.020 --> 03:06:59.300]   - Is that just the way of life, or is this?
[03:06:59.300 --> 03:07:02.980]   - I think we can definitely do better.
[03:07:02.980 --> 03:07:06.260]   And I think the first step is to kind of admit
[03:07:06.260 --> 03:07:10.740]   that we are not 100% seekers of truth,
[03:07:10.740 --> 03:07:12.020]   that we are human beings,
[03:07:12.020 --> 03:07:17.020]   and all the good and bad and the ugly qualities
[03:07:17.020 --> 03:07:20.300]   can be present,
[03:07:20.300 --> 03:07:24.660]   and to have some kind of dialogue in my subject,
[03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:26.220]   in mathematics.
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:27.620]   This has not happened yet.
[03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:28.980]   There have been some famous cases
[03:07:28.980 --> 03:07:30.380]   where people have been accused,
[03:07:30.420 --> 03:07:34.820]   which had been resolved or partially resolved or unresolved.
[03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:36.900]   And everybody knows it,
[03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:38.900]   but there isn't a systematic effort,
[03:07:38.900 --> 03:07:40.500]   as far as I can tell,
[03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:44.340]   of really trying to create some rules, some ethics rules.
[03:07:44.340 --> 03:07:47.260]   This is fair game, this is not fair game.
[03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:50.780]   So that as a community, we strive to get better.
[03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:52.580]   I think that for most people,
[03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:55.180]   it's more like keeping your head in the sand
[03:07:55.180 --> 03:07:57.500]   and kind of pretending that it doesn't happen.
[03:07:57.500 --> 03:07:59.660]   Or it happens, some isolated incidents.
[03:07:59.660 --> 03:08:02.500]   Well, my experience is not like that at all.
[03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:05.860]   I think it does happen much more often than it should.
[03:08:05.860 --> 03:08:07.460]   That's my opinion.
[03:08:07.460 --> 03:08:10.780]   - So there's the pool of academia is fascinating.
[03:08:10.780 --> 03:08:12.300]   One of the reasons I really love it
[03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:16.580]   is you have young minds with fresh ideas.
[03:08:16.580 --> 03:08:18.220]   And that same innocence you had
[03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:19.500]   with when you first on the train
[03:08:19.500 --> 03:08:21.420]   have that brilliant breakthrough.
[03:08:21.420 --> 03:08:23.260]   And then you throw that in together
[03:08:23.260 --> 03:08:27.580]   with senior exceptional world-class scientists
[03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:30.220]   who have, first of all, are getting older.
[03:08:30.220 --> 03:08:35.700]   Second of all, maybe they have partaken
[03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:40.380]   in the drug of fame and money and status and recognition.
[03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:43.100]   So that starts to a little bit corrupt
[03:08:43.100 --> 03:08:45.340]   all of our human minds.
[03:08:45.340 --> 03:08:47.420]   And you throw that mix in together.
[03:08:47.420 --> 03:08:48.620]   - Yeah.
[03:08:48.620 --> 03:08:50.200]   - Mostly without rules.
[03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:55.620]   And it's beautiful because that's where the ideas of old
[03:08:56.980 --> 03:09:00.380]   contend with the new wild-eyed crazy ideas.
[03:09:00.380 --> 03:09:02.740]   And they clash and there's a tension
[03:09:02.740 --> 03:09:04.840]   and there's a dance to it.
[03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:06.780]   But then there's the old human corruption
[03:09:06.780 --> 03:09:09.360]   that can take advantage of the young minds.
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:12.620]   It's unclear what to do with that.
[03:09:12.620 --> 03:09:14.180]   I mean, part of that is just the way of life
[03:09:14.180 --> 03:09:15.320]   and there's tragedies.
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:19.260]   And oftentimes when you look at who wins the Nobel Prize,
[03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:24.260]   it's also tragic because sometimes so many minds are,
[03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:28.140]   the trajectory to the breakthrough idea
[03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:30.900]   involves so many different minds, young and old.
[03:09:30.900 --> 03:09:35.900]   - Yeah, I mean, you're right.
[03:09:35.900 --> 03:09:38.520]   I think it's like with everything else.
[03:09:38.520 --> 03:09:42.900]   The path is to more self-awareness.
[03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:46.440]   And it's like owning up your own stuff
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:48.380]   and not blaming other people,
[03:09:48.380 --> 03:09:50.020]   not projecting onto other people,
[03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:52.100]   but taking responsibility.
[03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:53.820]   And that's true for everything.
[03:09:53.820 --> 03:09:58.220]   And the problem here, unique problem for mathematics,
[03:09:58.220 --> 03:10:00.660]   I would say physicists and chemists are better.
[03:10:00.660 --> 03:10:03.820]   They actually have better sort of ethical rules and so on,
[03:10:03.820 --> 03:10:05.060]   especially biologists.
[03:10:05.060 --> 03:10:06.780]   Because I think in part it's because
[03:10:06.780 --> 03:10:08.460]   there is much more money involved,
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:09.900]   because they have to get grants and so on.
[03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:11.460]   So for them, the question of priority,
[03:10:11.460 --> 03:10:13.820]   who discovered what first, is much more serious
[03:10:13.820 --> 03:10:15.780]   because there's really some serious money.
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:16.820]   Mathematics, who cares?
[03:10:16.820 --> 03:10:18.860]   You know, the Fermat's last theorem was proved.
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:20.460]   Did Andrew Wiles become a millionaire?
[03:10:20.460 --> 03:10:21.300]   No.
[03:10:21.300 --> 03:10:22.460]   - But I think he got a prize.
[03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:25.900]   - He won a prize, but those prizes are not--
[03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:26.740]   (laughing)
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:27.900]   - I think that one was a big prize,
[03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:30.300]   but in general, there's not going to be--
[03:10:30.300 --> 03:10:31.700]   - I think he won the Nobel Prize,
[03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:34.220]   eventually, which is about a million dollars.
[03:10:34.220 --> 03:10:38.220]   So, but, you know, sometimes I joke about this,
[03:10:38.220 --> 03:10:40.860]   that this is the hardest way to win a million dollars.
[03:10:40.860 --> 03:10:42.620]   (laughing)
[03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:47.260]   So, you know, but amongst mathematicians,
[03:10:47.260 --> 03:10:51.300]   I think the trouble is that we are so insulated
[03:10:52.300 --> 03:10:56.700]   from society, because it's such a pure subject.
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:11:01.620]   It draws in very specific psychological types.
[03:11:01.620 --> 03:11:03.220]   And I can speak about myself.
[03:11:03.220 --> 03:11:04.740]   I did not realize it at the time,
[03:11:04.740 --> 03:11:07.140]   but later on, I definitely saw,
[03:11:07.140 --> 03:11:08.860]   I mentioned some of it earlier,
[03:11:08.860 --> 03:11:11.300]   that for me, mathematics was a refuge
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:13.140]   from the cruelty of the life I experienced,
[03:11:13.140 --> 03:11:15.420]   from discrimination that I experienced
[03:11:15.420 --> 03:11:17.380]   when I applied to Moscow University at 16,
[03:11:17.380 --> 03:11:19.540]   being failed at the exam and stuff like that,
[03:11:19.540 --> 03:11:21.100]   which I describe in my book as well.
[03:11:21.100 --> 03:11:24.420]   But that was my way.
[03:11:24.420 --> 03:11:27.140]   I was like, I don't trust this world.
[03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:29.060]   I don't want to deal with it.
[03:11:29.060 --> 03:11:33.860]   I want to hide in this platonic reality of pure forms.
[03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:36.840]   This is where I know how to operate.
[03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:40.460]   I love this, and I couldn't be bothered, in some sense,
[03:11:40.460 --> 03:11:42.420]   for a while, up to a point.
[03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:45.060]   As I was getting older and more mature,
[03:11:45.060 --> 03:11:47.820]   I was becoming more and more interested in other things.
[03:11:47.820 --> 03:11:50.600]   But I think that's one of the reasons.
[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:55.600]   And one of the reasons why I wrote "Love and Math"
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:58.560]   was precisely to break that cycle,
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:02.940]   that it's the quiet guy in the corner that goes into math,
[03:12:02.940 --> 03:12:07.940]   and not the flamboyant jock or DJ.
[03:12:07.940 --> 03:12:14.140]   I wanted to show how beautiful the subject is,
[03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:16.160]   to attract this new blood,
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:17.660]   so that different psychological types,
[03:12:17.660 --> 03:12:22.660]   and more women would join.
[03:12:22.660 --> 03:12:26.240]   Because then they would have students
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:29.560]   who would look at them, whom they will inspire.
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:32.620]   And then it would be, instead of a vicious circle,
[03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:34.600]   it would be a virtuous circle.
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:36.440]   And I have to say, I think it's happening,
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:38.520]   not because of my efforts alone.
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:40.000]   Obviously, there are many other mathematicians
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:41.760]   who are, around the same time,
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:42.960]   started to put more effort.
[03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:46.800]   Because see, if the old stereotype of mathematician,
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:48.700]   you're so enclosed, you're not interested
[03:12:48.700 --> 03:12:52.860]   in even exposing the beauty of your subject to other people.
[03:12:52.860 --> 03:12:55.300]   And then it becomes this vicious circle.
[03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.080]   But you know, this one day,
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:00.520]   not one day, all the time I meet the students who say,
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:04.940]   your book is the reason why I chose math as my major.
[03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:07.140]   And I am proud, especially when it's women
[03:13:07.140 --> 03:13:08.180]   who tell me this.
[03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:11.840]   And they are cool, they are DJs at the same time,
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:14.860]   and they are social, and they have friends,
[03:13:14.860 --> 03:13:16.340]   and they go out, and so on.
[03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:18.980]   You see, so then they carry the torch.
[03:13:18.980 --> 03:13:20.940]   Because then they will be more likely
[03:13:20.940 --> 03:13:26.720]   to share this beauty with others,
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:28.300]   to attract more students, and so on.
[03:13:28.300 --> 03:13:30.500]   So I think this kind of, this dam was broken.
[03:13:30.500 --> 03:13:32.320]   So now you have more influx.
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:35.460]   And once we have people who are more able to connect
[03:13:35.460 --> 03:13:38.260]   at the personal level, that's when we also become
[03:13:38.260 --> 03:13:40.700]   more self-aware as a community, I think.
[03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:44.180]   And that's when we should be able to have a chance
[03:13:44.180 --> 03:13:46.660]   to improve in terms of our ethical rules
[03:13:46.660 --> 03:13:48.140]   and stuff like that.
[03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:51.600]   - So let me return to our friend, Eric Weinstein,
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:53.860]   for a question that I would ask anyway.
[03:13:53.860 --> 03:13:57.900]   But let's have a non-Russian ask the Russian question.
[03:13:57.900 --> 03:14:03.220]   Ask him about the Russian concepts of friendship,
[03:14:03.220 --> 03:14:06.060]   science, gender, and love versus the American.
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:09.660]   (laughing)
[03:14:09.660 --> 03:14:14.660]   You can, so there is a deep romanticism that you have
[03:14:14.660 --> 03:14:19.460]   that runs through your book, Love and Math.
[03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:24.540]   Is part of that something you've picked up
[03:14:24.540 --> 03:14:26.060]   from the Russian culture?
[03:14:26.060 --> 03:14:31.640]   What can you speak to that fueled both your fascination
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:33.740]   with math and your fascination, no,
[03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:38.740]   your prioritization of the human experience of love?
[03:14:39.660 --> 03:14:41.780]   - Hmm, good question.
[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:46.220]   Definitely there is some influence of the Russian culture,
[03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:48.080]   Russian literature, perhaps.
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:52.220]   But also, there's so many things.
[03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:54.740]   How do we develop certain sensibilities?
[03:14:54.740 --> 03:14:57.300]   Like, why do we care about this and not that?
[03:14:57.300 --> 03:15:00.460]   Like, why do I care, for instance, about, like you said,
[03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:04.460]   about this romantic ideal, so to speak, of mathematics?
[03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:07.460]   That's certainly not something that is automatic.
[03:15:07.460 --> 03:15:09.140]   Some people care about it, some people don't.
[03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:11.420]   And I'm not saying it is superior or inferior.
[03:15:11.420 --> 03:15:13.220]   It's just how my composition,
[03:15:13.220 --> 03:15:16.420]   my psychological composition is like that.
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:20.140]   And it's an interesting question, like,
[03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:21.780]   what is the cause of it?
[03:15:21.780 --> 03:15:25.220]   So I think that we cannot really know,
[03:15:25.220 --> 03:15:27.260]   but there are some aspects of it, of course.
[03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:32.260]   The experiences, life experiences are bringing family.
[03:15:34.260 --> 03:15:38.380]   Like, I was surrounded by love, by my parents,
[03:15:38.380 --> 03:15:41.780]   on the one hand, but on the other side,
[03:15:41.780 --> 03:15:44.420]   perhaps they were a little overprotective of me.
[03:15:44.420 --> 03:15:47.020]   So I was kind of like, you know,
[03:15:47.020 --> 03:15:51.100]   too much kind of like taken care of.
[03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:53.740]   So then when I, on one hand,
[03:15:53.740 --> 03:15:55.220]   it developed certain sensitivity,
[03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:58.620]   but I was kind of not ready for the challenges.
[03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:00.300]   - Of the real world. - Of the real world.
[03:16:00.300 --> 03:16:04.740]   So then that struggle, and then being lost,
[03:16:04.740 --> 03:16:07.420]   and then being able to overcome and to learn.
[03:16:07.420 --> 03:16:10.540]   And then if you do, in other words,
[03:16:10.540 --> 03:16:13.900]   if you don't lose, you don't appreciate maybe.
[03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:18.100]   But sometimes when we lose something and then regain it,
[03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:19.620]   then we cherish it, we appreciate it,
[03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:21.180]   and then it becomes something important.
[03:16:21.180 --> 03:16:25.940]   Also, various difficulties, you know,
[03:16:25.940 --> 03:16:28.420]   the upsetting experiences,
[03:16:28.420 --> 03:16:31.260]   or one could say traumatic experiences.
[03:16:31.260 --> 03:16:33.020]   Growing up in the Soviet Union,
[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:36.260]   that was not a walk in the park.
[03:16:36.260 --> 03:16:38.140]   There were a lot of issues there
[03:16:38.140 --> 03:16:40.860]   that I had to go through.
[03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:45.860]   And then it doesn't break you, makes you stronger.
[03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:51.460]   But in my case, what happened was that,
[03:16:51.460 --> 03:16:55.060]   for some of it, it took me 30 years
[03:16:55.060 --> 03:16:56.500]   to really come to terms with it
[03:16:56.500 --> 03:16:58.500]   and to really understand what happened.
[03:16:58.500 --> 03:17:01.420]   It gave me this motivation
[03:17:01.420 --> 03:17:06.660]   to strive to become a mathematician,
[03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:08.100]   which maybe I wouldn't have otherwise.
[03:17:08.100 --> 03:17:10.300]   It charged me, supercharged me.
[03:17:10.300 --> 03:17:11.460]   I'm talking about, for instance,
[03:17:11.460 --> 03:17:14.700]   the experience with exam at Moscow University.
[03:17:14.700 --> 03:17:16.460]   - Can you take me through that experience?
[03:17:16.460 --> 03:17:21.460]   - So this is 1984, we spoke about Orwell earlier.
[03:17:21.460 --> 03:17:25.540]   And I was applying to Moscow University.
[03:17:26.540 --> 03:17:30.380]   Mathematics department, it's called Mehmat.
[03:17:30.380 --> 03:17:32.860]   - Which is like, for people who don't know,
[03:17:32.860 --> 03:17:33.980]   like the place--
[03:17:33.980 --> 03:17:35.780]   - Was the only place to study pure mathematics
[03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:36.740]   in Moscow, period.
[03:17:36.740 --> 03:17:37.780]   - But also--
[03:17:37.780 --> 03:17:38.620]   - But also--
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:40.860]   - Considered to be one of the great places on Earth.
[03:17:40.860 --> 03:17:42.540]   - And it's like a huge building,
[03:17:42.540 --> 03:17:47.420]   this monolith of a building of Moscow University.
[03:17:47.420 --> 03:17:53.380]   So, because, as I said, a year earlier,
[03:17:53.380 --> 03:17:56.100]   Yevgeny Yevgenyevich converted me into math,
[03:17:56.100 --> 03:17:59.060]   capitalizing on my love for quantum physics.
[03:17:59.060 --> 03:18:01.620]   And so I spent a whole year studying with him
[03:18:01.620 --> 03:18:03.700]   and I was already kind of at the level of,
[03:18:03.700 --> 03:18:10.420]   in some subjects, a level of early graduate studies.
[03:18:10.420 --> 03:18:12.740]   So it seemed like it would be a breeze
[03:18:12.740 --> 03:18:14.940]   to get into Moscow University.
[03:18:14.940 --> 03:18:20.140]   But in fact, little did I know that there was
[03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:25.860]   a policy of antisemitism where students like me
[03:18:25.860 --> 03:18:29.180]   would be failed by special examiners,
[03:18:29.180 --> 03:18:32.060]   mostly during the oral exam with mathematics,
[03:18:32.060 --> 03:18:36.460]   but occasionally there would be written tests and stuff.
[03:18:36.460 --> 03:18:41.540]   Now, my father is Jewish by blood.
[03:18:41.540 --> 03:18:43.740]   It was not religious, his family was not religious.
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:44.780]   My mom is Russian.
[03:18:44.780 --> 03:18:49.020]   But since my last name was my father's name,
[03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:54.020]   so it was very easy to read what my nationality was.
[03:18:54.020 --> 03:18:57.340]   And so, can you imagine, there were special people
[03:18:57.340 --> 03:18:58.940]   who would screen up applicants,
[03:18:58.940 --> 03:19:03.500]   who would put aside the files of the undesirables.
[03:19:03.500 --> 03:19:04.860]   There would be special examiners
[03:19:04.860 --> 03:19:07.740]   who were actually professors at this university,
[03:19:07.740 --> 03:19:12.740]   who would be designated as those who would take the exam
[03:19:12.740 --> 03:19:15.020]   from those undesirables.
[03:19:15.020 --> 03:19:17.660]   It's almost comical when you look back now.
[03:19:17.660 --> 03:19:19.820]   And also, questions of why.
[03:19:19.820 --> 03:19:22.780]   There was no reason other than just hatred of the other.
[03:19:22.780 --> 03:19:23.620]   That's how I see it.
[03:19:23.620 --> 03:19:25.740]   - And just to give a little bit more color,
[03:19:25.740 --> 03:19:29.420]   because you mentioned nationality,
[03:19:29.420 --> 03:19:32.580]   it's a little quirk that perhaps gives an insight
[03:19:32.580 --> 03:19:35.100]   to the bigger system, that the nationality
[03:19:35.100 --> 03:19:37.220]   listed on your birth certificate when you're Jewish
[03:19:37.220 --> 03:19:40.860]   is Jewish, and when you're non-Jewish, it lists as Russian.
[03:19:40.860 --> 03:19:42.140]   - For me, it was Russian.
[03:19:42.140 --> 03:19:43.980]   So first of all, in the inner part,
[03:19:43.980 --> 03:19:46.220]   everybody has an internal passport.
[03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:50.900]   And there, you have first name, patronymic name,
[03:19:50.900 --> 03:19:54.140]   last name, date of birth, so there's four.
[03:19:54.140 --> 03:19:57.460]   And the fifth colon is nationality,
[03:19:57.460 --> 03:20:01.820]   which comes from the nationality of the parents and so on.
[03:20:01.820 --> 03:20:02.860]   In my case, it was written Russian
[03:20:02.860 --> 03:20:05.340]   because my mom was Russian, but it didn't save me.
[03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:07.980]   (both laughing)
[03:20:07.980 --> 03:20:10.380]   'Cause that was my dad's last name.
[03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:15.060]   And so anyway, this was the toughest experience
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:17.660]   that I had up until that point.
[03:20:17.660 --> 03:20:22.060]   And there was these two people who came into the room
[03:20:22.060 --> 03:20:24.340]   where I was the only undesirable.
[03:20:24.340 --> 03:20:27.300]   All other kids were being questioned by other examiners,
[03:20:27.300 --> 03:20:30.540]   but they told me that we cannot question you.
[03:20:30.540 --> 03:20:32.900]   We are waiting for special examiners.
[03:20:32.900 --> 03:20:36.420]   So I was like, uh-oh, something is afoot.
[03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:39.420]   And so these two guys came, and it was for four hours,
[03:20:39.420 --> 03:20:41.060]   basically, and were asking me questions
[03:20:41.060 --> 03:20:42.580]   which were not in the program and so on.
[03:20:42.580 --> 03:20:44.220]   But I was a kid, I was 16 years old.
[03:20:44.220 --> 03:20:46.860]   I tried to answer the best I can, but it was a setup.
[03:20:46.860 --> 03:20:50.060]   It's been documented since then.
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:52.820]   There are even lists of problems
[03:20:52.820 --> 03:20:55.980]   that were given to undesirables in those days.
[03:20:55.980 --> 03:21:00.380]   In my year, no Jewish applicants, as far as I know.
[03:21:00.380 --> 03:21:04.140]   Jewish, by this metric, were accepted.
[03:21:04.140 --> 03:21:05.580]   So then I had to go to this,
[03:21:05.580 --> 03:21:10.580]   there was one school, technical school in Moscow,
[03:21:10.580 --> 03:21:13.380]   which was the Institute for Oil and Gas Exploration,
[03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:16.780]   which had an applied mathematics program.
[03:21:16.780 --> 03:21:21.500]   And that's where many of the kids
[03:21:21.500 --> 03:21:24.420]   who were not accepted to Moscow University ended up.
[03:21:24.420 --> 03:21:28.820]   And so, but the point is, so,
[03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:31.860]   and then I was so motivated by this,
[03:21:31.860 --> 03:21:36.780]   because I wanted to show those guys, you know,
[03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:39.860]   that within five years, less than five years,
[03:21:39.860 --> 03:21:43.180]   I got a letter from the president of Harvard University
[03:21:43.180 --> 03:21:45.580]   inviting me as a visiting professor to Harvard.
[03:21:45.580 --> 03:21:47.860]   I was 21, I was barely 21,
[03:21:47.860 --> 03:21:51.180]   because I already did some research in the meantime.
[03:21:51.180 --> 03:21:54.340]   That's how motivated I was, you know.
[03:21:54.340 --> 03:21:57.420]   So, but the interesting aspect of it is that
[03:21:57.420 --> 03:22:01.820]   for the longest time afterwards,
[03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:05.020]   I was telling myself a story that nothing really happened.
[03:22:05.020 --> 03:22:07.340]   It wasn't so bad.
[03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:08.340]   Okay, so I was failed,
[03:22:08.340 --> 03:22:12.420]   but I knew that I was going to succeed.
[03:22:13.260 --> 03:22:18.260]   It was 30 years later that I finally got to meet that boy,
[03:22:18.260 --> 03:22:24.180]   that 16-year-old, that I neglected at this time.
[03:22:24.180 --> 03:22:25.900]   And I realized that he died,
[03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:28.580]   that it was a crushing blow.
[03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:29.940]   - The innocence?
[03:22:29.940 --> 03:22:32.820]   - Not just the innocence, because there was no way,
[03:22:32.820 --> 03:22:33.980]   it looked like there was no way
[03:22:33.980 --> 03:22:35.300]   I could become a mathematician.
[03:22:35.300 --> 03:22:40.220]   Because if they don't accept me there, it's over.
[03:22:40.220 --> 03:22:44.620]   I didn't know that I could actually find this striving
[03:22:44.620 --> 03:22:46.300]   applied math program,
[03:22:46.300 --> 03:22:48.620]   and then eventually somebody would take me under his wing
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:51.300]   and so on, and then could move to the United States.
[03:22:51.300 --> 03:22:54.300]   This was not in the realm of possibilities.
[03:22:54.300 --> 03:22:57.380]   So in other words, there was nothing to look forward to.
[03:22:57.380 --> 03:22:59.140]   It was clear that it's over.
[03:22:59.140 --> 03:23:03.300]   I cannot, I cannot do what I love.
[03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:07.020]   And so when I finally,
[03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:12.900]   when I finally connected to that boy, oh my God,
[03:23:12.900 --> 03:23:14.260]   that was a totally different experience.
[03:23:14.260 --> 03:23:19.020]   All the pain and all the trauma came to the surface,
[03:23:19.020 --> 03:23:22.740]   and it was a kind of a tsunami.
[03:23:22.740 --> 03:23:24.940]   I wasn't sure I would survive this.
[03:23:24.940 --> 03:23:26.980]   It was so hard.
[03:23:26.980 --> 03:23:28.820]   And what happened was I was invited
[03:23:28.820 --> 03:23:32.060]   to give a talk about this in New York.
[03:23:32.060 --> 03:23:37.380]   It was kind of a spoken word event about science,
[03:23:37.380 --> 03:23:39.780]   but like personal experiences related to science.
[03:23:39.780 --> 03:23:43.820]   This was almost a year after my book came out.
[03:23:43.820 --> 03:23:46.460]   In my book, one of the first chapters
[03:23:46.460 --> 03:23:48.820]   is a chapter about this experience.
[03:23:48.820 --> 03:23:51.980]   But what I realize now is that I wrote it
[03:23:51.980 --> 03:23:54.140]   from the third-person perspective.
[03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:55.180]   I knew the facts,
[03:23:55.180 --> 03:23:58.140]   but I was not emotionally connected to that experience.
[03:23:58.140 --> 03:24:00.700]   However, since I wanted to write the book
[03:24:00.700 --> 03:24:04.780]   and to connect to my readers, I allowed the boy to write it.
[03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:07.780]   So a lot of people were touched by it,
[03:24:07.780 --> 03:24:09.180]   and they would, people would say,
[03:24:09.180 --> 03:24:12.300]   "Wow, that chapter, it really got a lot of resonance.
[03:24:12.300 --> 03:24:13.740]   "It was translated into other language
[03:24:13.740 --> 03:24:16.380]   "even before the book was published."
[03:24:16.380 --> 03:24:19.380]   I was surprised by this because I didn't know yet.
[03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:22.540]   So the adult Edward was not yet in touch,
[03:24:22.540 --> 03:24:26.780]   but the book gave the outlet to the child.
[03:24:26.780 --> 03:24:32.380]   And that kind of started the process.
[03:24:32.380 --> 03:24:36.620]   So finally, almost a year later,
[03:24:36.620 --> 03:24:40.340]   I'm in New York in this event,
[03:24:40.340 --> 03:24:43.980]   and the night before, I'm in my hotel room,
[03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:46.500]   and I was like, "Okay, what am I going to talk about tomorrow?"
[03:24:46.500 --> 03:24:48.180]   And I take a piece of paper just to,
[03:24:48.180 --> 03:24:50.980]   you know, my usual preparation for things.
[03:24:50.980 --> 03:24:53.420]   And then suddenly I have this vision
[03:24:53.420 --> 03:24:55.900]   that I will walk up to the microphone tomorrow,
[03:24:55.900 --> 03:24:58.780]   and I will just start crying.
[03:25:00.820 --> 03:25:05.820]   And I was like, by that time, I already had an insight
[03:25:05.820 --> 03:25:09.980]   that it's possible to have that kind of a splitting,
[03:25:09.980 --> 03:25:11.100]   kind of dissociation.
[03:25:11.100 --> 03:25:14.900]   But things were happening quickly.
[03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:16.980]   There was someone in my life who explained to me this idea
[03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:20.980]   that some things are under the radar of awareness,
[03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:23.260]   but they may still influence you,
[03:25:23.260 --> 03:25:25.900]   and a lot of that could be connected
[03:25:25.900 --> 03:25:29.420]   to some experiences in your childhood.
[03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:32.860]   So I was kind of ready for it from different angles,
[03:25:32.860 --> 03:25:35.420]   but I was so surprised because I was like,
[03:25:35.420 --> 03:25:36.420]   "What is there to remember?
[03:25:36.420 --> 03:25:38.500]   "I know, I know everything."
[03:25:38.500 --> 03:25:39.980]   So then my inner voice says,
[03:25:39.980 --> 03:25:42.460]   "All right, then, you have nothing to worry about.
[03:25:42.460 --> 03:25:46.220]   "We'll go tomorrow, and you will speak about this.
[03:25:46.220 --> 03:25:48.700]   "And if you start crying, it's not a problem."
[03:25:48.700 --> 03:25:51.980]   And I was like, "No, I don't want to cry in front of people.
[03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:54.900]   "I want to find out what it is, what happened."
[03:25:54.900 --> 03:25:58.700]   And I sat on my bed, closed my eyes, and it came.
[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:03.140]   So it's hard to describe.
[03:26:03.140 --> 03:26:07.940]   So this is what, and the sheer energy of it,
[03:26:07.940 --> 03:26:10.700]   and how much effort it took to suppress it, actually,
[03:26:10.700 --> 03:26:13.300]   for all these years, how much effort it took
[03:26:13.300 --> 03:26:17.020]   to build that panzer, I want to say in Russian,
[03:26:17.020 --> 03:26:20.380]   you know, that hardcore around myself.
[03:26:20.380 --> 03:26:23.500]   So that, and the thing, later I realized
[03:26:23.500 --> 03:26:26.420]   there were moments when it could come out.
[03:26:26.420 --> 03:26:31.020]   And for instance, I developed this fear of public speaking.
[03:26:31.020 --> 03:26:35.140]   All kinds of little things that I now feel were connected.
[03:26:35.140 --> 03:26:37.940]   So anyway, I saw what happened now
[03:26:37.940 --> 03:26:39.860]   through the eyes of that child.
[03:26:39.860 --> 03:26:43.020]   I saw how difficult it was, how crushed he was.
[03:26:43.020 --> 03:26:46.020]   And it looked completely hopeless.
[03:26:46.020 --> 03:26:48.660]   And I felt like, what's the point of living now for me,
[03:26:48.660 --> 03:26:52.300]   now that I know how cruel this world is,
[03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:53.460]   which I didn't realize before,
[03:26:53.460 --> 03:26:55.980]   because I prefer to wear this pink,
[03:26:55.980 --> 03:26:59.180]   you know, the rose-colored glasses.
[03:26:59.180 --> 03:27:03.300]   But then something happened, it's so strange.
[03:27:03.300 --> 03:27:05.900]   It's like you feel that inside of you
[03:27:05.900 --> 03:27:07.660]   there is this dead child.
[03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:09.500]   And it is incredibly sad.
[03:27:09.500 --> 03:27:13.780]   I mean, it's like, I can't even describe it.
[03:27:13.780 --> 03:27:15.620]   But suddenly he comes alive.
[03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:19.140]   And suddenly it's like, oh, he's here.
[03:27:19.140 --> 03:27:20.820]   And I had a little talk with him,
[03:27:20.820 --> 03:27:23.380]   and I said, "Look, I know, and now I thank you.
[03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:27.300]   "I'm so sorry that I neglected you for so long.
[03:27:27.300 --> 03:27:29.100]   "I didn't know.
[03:27:29.100 --> 03:27:32.060]   "I thank you for doing this."
[03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:35.380]   And it's almost like, I felt like the image came to mind
[03:27:35.380 --> 03:27:36.620]   is like a fallen soldier,
[03:27:36.620 --> 03:27:39.300]   like you leave a fallen soldier on the battlefield,
[03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:40.580]   a wounded soldier,
[03:27:40.580 --> 03:27:44.500]   and then you come back to take him with you.
[03:27:44.500 --> 03:27:47.940]   And I said, "But look, look what we have done.
[03:27:47.940 --> 03:27:49.500]   "Look at us now."
[03:27:49.500 --> 03:27:51.020]   It was not in vain.
[03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:52.260]   We are doing okay.
[03:27:52.260 --> 03:27:56.420]   And it's kind of almost just like holding,
[03:27:56.420 --> 03:28:00.420]   holding, holding that child
[03:28:00.420 --> 03:28:05.140]   and that sense of who I am, you know,
[03:28:05.140 --> 03:28:06.700]   and feeling it.
[03:28:06.700 --> 03:28:11.100]   So the next day I went to the microphone
[03:28:11.100 --> 03:28:12.940]   and I let him speak for the first time
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:17.060]   about his experience in his own voice.
[03:28:17.060 --> 03:28:17.980]   It was incredible.
[03:28:17.980 --> 03:28:21.180]   People were crying and afterwards came up to me
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:22.980]   and started sharing stories and so on.
[03:28:22.980 --> 03:28:25.300]   Because it is a story, it's a universal story.
[03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:27.260]   It's archetypal story.
[03:28:27.260 --> 03:28:32.260]   It's the story of rejection and being treated unfairly.
[03:28:32.260 --> 03:28:35.140]   We all know it.
[03:28:35.140 --> 03:28:38.060]   And I think it's so important to realize
[03:28:38.060 --> 03:28:41.980]   that it's possible to revisit those moments.
[03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:44.780]   It's possible to reconnect to our little ones.
[03:28:44.780 --> 03:28:46.420]   It's possible to bring them back.
[03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:49.580]   And we are better for it
[03:28:49.580 --> 03:28:53.060]   because this changed my life, this experience.
[03:28:53.060 --> 03:28:55.340]   Then suddenly it's like a floodgates.
[03:28:55.340 --> 03:28:58.100]   There were many other things that came.
[03:28:58.100 --> 03:29:00.940]   That's when I became interested
[03:29:00.940 --> 03:29:04.300]   in the dimensions of imagination and intuition and so on.
[03:29:04.300 --> 03:29:07.140]   Because suddenly I realized that I was deprived
[03:29:07.140 --> 03:29:09.500]   of that possibility of looking at the world
[03:29:09.500 --> 03:29:10.340]   through the eyes of a child
[03:29:10.340 --> 03:29:13.220]   because that child was frozen in time.
[03:29:13.220 --> 03:29:15.180]   I was not connected to him.
[03:29:15.180 --> 03:29:17.140]   But suddenly he's with me
[03:29:17.140 --> 03:29:20.740]   and he's like, almost like opens his doors
[03:29:20.740 --> 03:29:24.380]   and he says, "Look at this, look at this."
[03:29:24.380 --> 03:29:29.980]   So.
[03:29:29.980 --> 03:29:36.140]   - If I could ask you about, there's a difficult idea here.
[03:29:36.140 --> 03:29:37.460]   There's a tension.
[03:29:37.460 --> 03:29:41.060]   I've interacted with a few folks in my personal life
[03:29:41.060 --> 03:29:45.020]   and in general that have lived through this experience
[03:29:45.020 --> 03:29:50.020]   of unfairness and cruelty in the world as young people.
[03:29:50.020 --> 03:29:56.980]   And what wisdom do you draw from the action you took
[03:29:56.980 --> 03:30:04.140]   of not acknowledging that you're a victim to cruelty
[03:30:04.140 --> 03:30:07.040]   but instead just working your ass off, working harder?
[03:30:07.040 --> 03:30:12.180]   And then the flip side of that
[03:30:12.180 --> 03:30:14.500]   is you eventually reconnecting
[03:30:14.500 --> 03:30:16.500]   with the cruelty that you experienced.
[03:30:16.500 --> 03:30:18.580]   Because if you did that early on--
[03:30:18.580 --> 03:30:19.420]   - I was not ready for it.
[03:30:19.420 --> 03:30:21.020]   It is a defense mechanism.
[03:30:21.020 --> 03:30:24.420]   You know, there were kids who commit suicide
[03:30:24.420 --> 03:30:25.580]   after this experience.
[03:30:25.580 --> 03:30:28.180]   I could have committed suicide because it's too much.
[03:30:28.180 --> 03:30:31.020]   And it is well known afterwards, of course,
[03:30:31.020 --> 03:30:32.820]   I became aware of all the literature
[03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:36.340]   about childhood trauma and so on.
[03:30:36.340 --> 03:30:40.940]   And I've been speaking publicly about it since then too.
[03:30:40.940 --> 03:30:44.500]   And so, it is a well-known issue
[03:30:44.500 --> 03:30:49.500]   and a well-known kind of a universal phenomenon.
[03:30:49.500 --> 03:30:53.220]   I think that, interestingly enough,
[03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:56.780]   even though now I see a lot of discussion of it,
[03:30:56.780 --> 03:30:58.380]   now that my eyes are open,
[03:30:58.380 --> 03:31:01.220]   but somehow before I didn't see it.
[03:31:01.220 --> 03:31:04.020]   Which also shows you how our confirmation bias,
[03:31:04.020 --> 03:31:06.140]   kind of like how we screen ourselves,
[03:31:06.140 --> 03:31:07.760]   how we turn a blind eye to things
[03:31:07.760 --> 03:31:09.060]   which do not confirm our views
[03:31:09.060 --> 03:31:10.540]   or for which we are not yet ready.
[03:31:10.540 --> 03:31:13.620]   And by the way, nobody should push to do it too soon.
[03:31:13.620 --> 03:31:18.620]   I'm glad I developed certain strength.
[03:31:18.620 --> 03:31:20.820]   I was confident.
[03:31:20.820 --> 03:31:25.140]   I was strong to withstand this.
[03:31:25.140 --> 03:31:28.420]   And if I weren't, who knows how it could turn out.
[03:31:28.420 --> 03:31:31.900]   So it is a very subtle kind of alchemical process,
[03:31:31.900 --> 03:31:35.380]   which I don't think there is a recipe, there's a formula.
[03:31:35.380 --> 03:31:38.180]   The reason I'm talking about this
[03:31:38.180 --> 03:31:40.340]   is just to share this experience
[03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:43.180]   because I think that the only thing we can do in this,
[03:31:43.180 --> 03:31:45.440]   in some sense, is to share with each other.
[03:31:45.440 --> 03:31:49.300]   Because then we can find, for instance,
[03:31:49.300 --> 03:31:52.740]   if somebody shared with me,
[03:31:52.740 --> 03:31:55.580]   it would naturally lead me maybe to get closer to that,
[03:31:55.580 --> 03:31:57.180]   to kind of understanding.
[03:31:57.180 --> 03:31:59.220]   It's really just personal stories.
[03:31:59.220 --> 03:32:04.220]   It's not, obviously there is a component
[03:32:04.220 --> 03:32:06.740]   where professionals could be involved,
[03:32:06.740 --> 03:32:08.540]   professional therapists and so on.
[03:32:08.540 --> 03:32:11.540]   In my case, it somehow happened miraculously.
[03:32:11.540 --> 03:32:12.940]   Well, I did have support,
[03:32:12.940 --> 03:32:15.380]   but not from professional therapists,
[03:32:15.380 --> 03:32:17.340]   but from dear friends.
[03:32:17.340 --> 03:32:19.340]   So I did have, you do need,
[03:32:19.340 --> 03:32:22.500]   I had somebody at the time who basically held my hand
[03:32:22.500 --> 03:32:25.220]   and through this experience, yes, it was invaluable
[03:32:25.220 --> 03:32:26.980]   and it could not be done otherwise.
[03:32:26.980 --> 03:32:30.580]   So I think it's very common.
[03:32:30.580 --> 03:32:32.380]   And here's the thing.
[03:32:35.620 --> 03:32:39.700]   I would not do it any other way.
[03:32:39.700 --> 03:32:44.700]   When I reconnected and I saw all the horrors and so on,
[03:32:44.700 --> 03:32:49.060]   but I also was able to see that my examiners
[03:32:49.060 --> 03:32:54.060]   were victims of their own situation,
[03:32:54.060 --> 03:32:58.420]   that they fell for this bogus theories,
[03:32:58.420 --> 03:33:00.340]   or maybe it was more of an issue
[03:33:00.340 --> 03:33:02.540]   of career advancement or something.
[03:33:02.540 --> 03:33:05.520]   And I also realized they must have suffered,
[03:33:05.520 --> 03:33:07.500]   as well, because they must have had
[03:33:07.500 --> 03:33:10.420]   some kind of consciousness about it,
[03:33:10.420 --> 03:33:14.600]   that acting this way towards sort of basically kids.
[03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:17.900]   So it wasn't pretty from their point of view.
[03:33:17.900 --> 03:33:19.340]   So I could forgive them.
[03:33:19.340 --> 03:33:23.020]   And I could also appreciate
[03:33:23.020 --> 03:33:27.140]   what a boost of energy it gave me.
[03:33:27.140 --> 03:33:29.820]   If I was accepted and I was just where,
[03:33:29.820 --> 03:33:31.500]   I was a first year student,
[03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:33.980]   I would live in a dorm because I was in,
[03:33:33.980 --> 03:33:36.440]   you know, I'd be probably partying and drinking,
[03:33:36.440 --> 03:33:37.580]   and who knows what,
[03:33:37.580 --> 03:33:40.020]   maybe I wouldn't even become a mathematician.
[03:33:40.020 --> 03:33:43.800]   But this focused me like a laser
[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:45.460]   without me even thinking about it.
[03:33:45.460 --> 03:33:46.500]   It just happened.
[03:33:46.500 --> 03:33:50.100]   I didn't care about anything but doing mathematics.
[03:33:50.100 --> 03:33:51.180]   And it paid off.
[03:33:51.180 --> 03:33:52.540]   You know, it changed my life.
[03:33:52.540 --> 03:33:54.180]   So was it good or bad?
[03:33:54.180 --> 03:33:56.500]   Paradox.
[03:33:56.500 --> 03:33:57.860]   (laughing)
[03:33:57.860 --> 03:33:59.560]   - Seems like life is full of those.
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:03.620]   You said you lost your father four years ago.
[03:34:03.620 --> 03:34:04.980]   - Yeah.
[03:34:04.980 --> 03:34:08.380]   - What have you learned about life from your dad?
[03:34:08.380 --> 03:34:10.140]   - That's another big one.
[03:34:10.140 --> 03:34:12.100]   Yeah, because I was very close to him.
[03:34:12.100 --> 03:34:15.860]   And it was tough, it was tough.
[03:34:15.860 --> 03:34:17.660]   And I was not,
[03:34:17.660 --> 03:34:21.980]   I was sort of not ready for it
[03:34:21.980 --> 03:34:23.500]   because up until that point,
[03:34:23.500 --> 03:34:26.100]   I lived pretending that death does not exist.
[03:34:26.100 --> 03:34:29.060]   When my grandparents died,
[03:34:29.060 --> 03:34:31.260]   I was already in the US.
[03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:32.660]   So it was very convenient.
[03:34:32.660 --> 03:34:35.460]   And I couldn't go back, so I grieved.
[03:34:35.460 --> 03:34:38.300]   But it kind of was a bit abstract for me.
[03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:39.940]   I didn't see their dead bodies, you know?
[03:34:39.940 --> 03:34:43.580]   I didn't bury them and so on.
[03:34:43.580 --> 03:34:46.380]   So I waited till the,
[03:34:46.380 --> 03:34:49.500]   so the first death in my life was my father,
[03:34:49.500 --> 03:34:52.220]   like of really close loved ones.
[03:34:52.220 --> 03:34:53.860]   And I was absolutely devastated.
[03:34:53.860 --> 03:34:58.020]   You know, he was such an amazing creature,
[03:34:58.020 --> 03:34:59.220]   such an amazing human being.
[03:34:59.220 --> 03:35:01.820]   He was the kindest, the smartest,
[03:35:01.820 --> 03:35:05.140]   the most funny, just really funny.
[03:35:05.140 --> 03:35:07.780]   And just really fun to be with, you know?
[03:35:07.780 --> 03:35:09.220]   This is what I miss, obviously.
[03:35:09.220 --> 03:35:12.380]   I mean, I would just love to hang out with him.
[03:35:12.380 --> 03:35:15.580]   So, and then suddenly he's not there.
[03:35:15.580 --> 03:35:19.260]   So it was tough, but it kind of changed my perspective.
[03:35:19.260 --> 03:35:20.540]   - You miss him?
[03:35:20.540 --> 03:35:21.860]   - I miss him tremendously.
[03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:25.060]   I miss him tremendously.
[03:35:25.060 --> 03:35:28.660]   But in a way, I learned that he never left me.
[03:35:28.660 --> 03:35:30.580]   I mean, it sounds so,
[03:35:30.580 --> 03:35:32.420]   the words are so, you know, like,
[03:35:32.420 --> 03:35:33.260]   they are,
[03:35:33.260 --> 03:35:37.020]   you cannot express in words this,
[03:35:37.020 --> 03:35:38.860]   what I'm trying to say.
[03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:40.380]   But--
[03:35:40.380 --> 03:35:42.860]   - Do you carry him with you?
[03:35:42.860 --> 03:35:43.980]   - Yeah.
[03:35:43.980 --> 03:35:45.740]   And in some sense, I always did.
[03:35:45.740 --> 03:35:51.380]   I saw that, that it's always been,
[03:35:51.380 --> 03:35:56.740]   it was really, we were one in some sense, you know?
[03:35:56.740 --> 03:35:58.460]   But there was this experience of,
[03:35:59.140 --> 03:36:04.540]   two people being together,
[03:36:04.540 --> 03:36:06.540]   and that I miss tremendously.
[03:36:06.540 --> 03:36:09.740]   But he gave me so much.
[03:36:09.740 --> 03:36:12.820]   And, you know, let me tell you one aspect of it,
[03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:13.660]   for instance.
[03:36:13.660 --> 03:36:17.780]   When he was a kid, his father was sent to Gulag
[03:36:17.780 --> 03:36:19.300]   on bogus pretenses, right?
[03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:22.860]   So he, when he was 16, he applied to a university.
[03:36:22.860 --> 03:36:25.180]   He wanted to become a theoretical physicist.
[03:36:25.180 --> 03:36:26.780]   By the way, my love for theoretical physics
[03:36:26.780 --> 03:36:30.420]   was to a large extent because of that.
[03:36:30.420 --> 03:36:33.180]   And he was not accepted, even though he was brilliant,
[03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:35.700]   because he was the son of the enemy of the people.
[03:36:35.700 --> 03:36:37.940]   And he,
[03:36:37.940 --> 03:36:41.380]   it kind of broke him, this experience,
[03:36:41.380 --> 03:36:44.940]   that he didn't care when he was,
[03:36:44.940 --> 03:36:46.100]   he went to a technical school,
[03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:47.180]   and he didn't really care.
[03:36:47.180 --> 03:36:48.540]   That's my take on it.
[03:36:48.540 --> 03:36:53.460]   And then he ended up in this little provincial town,
[03:36:53.460 --> 03:36:55.580]   and he thought he would escape from it as soon as possible.
[03:36:55.580 --> 03:36:57.980]   And then he met my mother, and they fell in love.
[03:36:57.980 --> 03:37:00.060]   (laughs)
[03:37:00.060 --> 03:37:04.380]   And so I am sort of the product of that, you know?
[03:37:04.380 --> 03:37:05.220]   - Of physics.
[03:37:05.220 --> 03:37:07.620]   - But then what I learned is that
[03:37:07.620 --> 03:37:11.140]   because he was not able to overcome
[03:37:11.140 --> 03:37:13.620]   that specific experience,
[03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:15.260]   it fell to me to do it.
[03:37:15.260 --> 03:37:18.580]   And if I didn't, my son or my daughter would have.
[03:37:18.580 --> 03:37:21.300]   I think that that was one of the things I learned,
[03:37:21.300 --> 03:37:22.580]   that it was not by chance,
[03:37:22.580 --> 03:37:27.020]   that about the same age, for slightly different reasons,
[03:37:27.020 --> 03:37:30.380]   I was subjected to the same kind of unfairness and cruelty.
[03:37:30.380 --> 03:37:35.060]   And in some ways, I feel like I did it for him also.
[03:37:35.060 --> 03:37:38.420]   Because he was also always so proud of me,
[03:37:38.420 --> 03:37:39.740]   and was so happy.
[03:37:39.740 --> 03:37:42.700]   And I had this tremendous gift.
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:46.260]   Twice, I was invited by American Mathematical Society
[03:37:46.260 --> 03:37:48.380]   to give these big lectures, twice.
[03:37:48.380 --> 03:37:51.180]   It was in 2012 and in 2018.
[03:37:52.420 --> 03:37:54.620]   And both times, they were in Boston.
[03:37:54.620 --> 03:37:56.340]   It could be anywhere in the US.
[03:37:56.340 --> 03:37:58.260]   Both times, it was in Boston,
[03:37:58.260 --> 03:38:00.860]   walking distance from my parents' place.
[03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:02.900]   So he could be there, and my mom as well.
[03:38:02.900 --> 03:38:06.660]   And that was such a gift, that he was beaming,
[03:38:06.660 --> 03:38:08.900]   you know, like seeing me on the stage.
[03:38:08.900 --> 03:38:10.420]   Like, "Ah!"
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:12.860]   So, you know.
[03:38:12.860 --> 03:38:17.980]   - Now that he's no longer here, and it's just you.
[03:38:17.980 --> 03:38:19.980]   - Well, I still have my mom, I still have my sister.
[03:38:19.980 --> 03:38:21.820]   - Yeah, but as a man,
[03:38:21.820 --> 03:38:23.700]   there's some aspect that it's,
[03:38:23.700 --> 03:38:29.060]   that it does hit you hard.
[03:38:29.060 --> 03:38:30.780]   Are you afraid of your own death?
[03:38:30.780 --> 03:38:32.940]   Do you think about your death?
[03:38:32.940 --> 03:38:34.740]   Are you afraid of it?
[03:38:34.740 --> 03:38:38.820]   - I have a certain conceptual view of life and death today,
[03:38:38.820 --> 03:38:40.380]   which is informed by my experiences.
[03:38:40.380 --> 03:38:43.100]   In particular, going through my father's death.
[03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:48.100]   And that is something which cannot be conceptualized.
[03:38:48.260 --> 03:38:51.580]   That experience, like you cannot give it to somebody.
[03:38:51.580 --> 03:38:56.620]   One thing I will say is that I felt that what it was,
[03:38:56.620 --> 03:39:00.620]   it was actually love totally exposed, like naked.
[03:39:00.620 --> 03:39:04.620]   And you try to throw, it is so acute.
[03:39:04.620 --> 03:39:07.980]   So being, facing that love is incredibly painful,
[03:39:07.980 --> 03:39:09.940]   because it's so intense.
[03:39:09.940 --> 03:39:14.340]   When a person is alive, we have conversation,
[03:39:14.340 --> 03:39:16.100]   we have words, we have some actions,
[03:39:16.100 --> 03:39:17.700]   we have some stuff is going on.
[03:39:17.700 --> 03:39:19.020]   And it puts a filter.
[03:39:19.020 --> 03:39:22.460]   So we rarely actually feel love
[03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:26.820]   in this totally, completely pure, unadulterated state.
[03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:28.940]   But when a person dies, it's there.
[03:39:28.940 --> 03:39:30.260]   And it's staring at you,
[03:39:30.260 --> 03:39:32.220]   and no matter what you do, you cannot turn away.
[03:39:32.220 --> 03:39:33.780]   Like, I tried to, it's like,
[03:39:33.780 --> 03:39:36.380]   almost I felt like I wanna throw a blanket over it.
[03:39:36.380 --> 03:39:37.220]   - Yeah.
[03:39:37.220 --> 03:39:39.540]   - It burns, like, immediately.
[03:39:39.540 --> 03:39:41.140]   Like, boom, gone.
[03:39:41.140 --> 03:39:41.980]   It's there.
[03:39:41.980 --> 03:39:44.460]   Live through it.
[03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.220]   And I kept saying to myself,
[03:39:46.220 --> 03:39:47.980]   live through it, live through it.
[03:39:47.980 --> 03:39:49.580]   That's how you, and that's how you know,
[03:39:49.580 --> 03:39:52.020]   also learn what is love, for example.
[03:39:52.020 --> 03:39:53.660]   What is it really?
[03:39:53.660 --> 03:39:54.500]   What is love?
[03:39:54.500 --> 03:39:55.660]   What is life, also?
[03:39:55.660 --> 03:39:59.300]   Because I was completely, I had no idea.
[03:39:59.300 --> 03:40:02.500]   And then you kind of learn that, okay,
[03:40:02.500 --> 03:40:05.900]   so maybe it's not quite,
[03:40:05.900 --> 03:40:08.940]   there's more to it.
[03:40:08.940 --> 03:40:09.940]   There is more to it.
[03:40:09.940 --> 03:40:11.740]   There's more to this experience
[03:40:11.740 --> 03:40:14.380]   than what can be put in a concept
[03:40:14.380 --> 03:40:18.380]   or in a sentence, in a,
[03:40:18.380 --> 03:40:22.620]   maybe poetry or music can do some justice to it.
[03:40:22.620 --> 03:40:26.060]   But if so, then my own life has that component,
[03:40:26.060 --> 03:40:27.740]   has that dimension,
[03:40:27.740 --> 03:40:31.060]   which is beyond anything I can say about it, you know?
[03:40:31.060 --> 03:40:35.300]   And even though I love this, being this, playing this role,
[03:40:35.300 --> 03:40:36.140]   I love it.
[03:40:36.140 --> 03:40:40.820]   And I kind of, it kind of makes me feel different
[03:40:40.820 --> 03:40:43.140]   about all kinds of difficulties that arise,
[03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:46.060]   because it's almost like I want to enjoy it,
[03:40:46.060 --> 03:40:48.220]   because that's what being human is.
[03:40:48.220 --> 03:40:51.020]   It's being terrified.
[03:40:51.020 --> 03:40:52.980]   It's being frustrated.
[03:40:52.980 --> 03:40:55.900]   It's being self-loathing sometimes.
[03:40:55.900 --> 03:40:59.700]   It's not knowing, but also being joyful
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:04.700]   and just like, ah, let's just enjoy it, kind of all of it.
[03:41:04.700 --> 03:41:08.940]   That's why you came here for, in some sense, you know?
[03:41:08.940 --> 03:41:12.140]   It's like not trying to run away from things,
[03:41:12.140 --> 03:41:15.740]   but kind of trying to just live through them and appreciate.
[03:41:15.740 --> 03:41:17.940]   So the biggest thing is gratitude, in some sense.
[03:41:17.940 --> 03:41:18.780]   It's just gratitude.
[03:41:18.780 --> 03:41:20.740]   So thank you for letting me play.
[03:41:20.740 --> 03:41:22.380]   - It's gratitude for every single moment,
[03:41:22.380 --> 03:41:23.740]   even if it's dark, even if it's lost.
[03:41:23.740 --> 03:41:25.900]   - Yes, and that's why I am so,
[03:41:25.900 --> 03:41:28.420]   people around me, they all say that it's total doom
[03:41:28.420 --> 03:41:30.820]   and gloom and the world is ending.
[03:41:30.820 --> 03:41:33.300]   And I'm like, first of all,
[03:41:33.300 --> 03:41:36.060]   that's how you see it, okay?
[03:41:36.060 --> 03:41:37.860]   That's not the only point of view.
[03:41:37.860 --> 03:41:40.660]   But also, even if it is, that's your challenge.
[03:41:40.660 --> 03:41:41.860]   What are you going to do about it?
[03:41:41.860 --> 03:41:43.940]   Stop complaining about other people.
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:45.020]   Do something yourself.
[03:41:45.020 --> 03:41:48.220]   How can you make it a better world, you know?
[03:41:48.220 --> 03:41:51.340]   - And I think all of that starts with just a gratitude
[03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:54.140]   for the moment, to be able to play this game.
[03:41:54.140 --> 03:41:56.380]   - Yeah, how beautiful it is.
[03:41:56.380 --> 03:42:00.740]   - We've talked about love, but let me ask,
[03:42:00.740 --> 03:42:03.580]   what role does love play in this whole game,
[03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:04.820]   in the human condition?
[03:42:04.820 --> 03:42:06.500]   - It's like the glue, you know?
[03:42:06.500 --> 03:42:07.900]   It's like, for me, it's like that.
[03:42:07.900 --> 03:42:10.180]   (both laughing)
[03:42:10.180 --> 03:42:12.940]   And it's not because people say love is like,
[03:42:12.940 --> 03:42:14.980]   for a human being, like a romantic love,
[03:42:14.980 --> 03:42:17.220]   which is a huge component of it, obviously,
[03:42:17.220 --> 03:42:19.540]   because it's so, so beautiful to be able
[03:42:19.540 --> 03:42:21.900]   to express it in this way.
[03:42:21.900 --> 03:42:24.700]   But it could be love for what you do,
[03:42:24.700 --> 03:42:27.500]   for your passion for something, you know?
[03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:32.500]   And, or love for your friends, for instance,
[03:42:32.500 --> 03:42:36.260]   or love, it doesn't have to be.
[03:42:36.260 --> 03:42:41.060]   And so, in some sense, that's what it's all about,
[03:42:41.060 --> 03:42:44.700]   in the ultimate, because living without love,
[03:42:44.700 --> 03:42:49.420]   it's kind of bland, boring, and so--
[03:42:49.420 --> 03:42:51.140]   - And I don't think it's possible for science
[03:42:51.140 --> 03:42:53.820]   to explain exactly what it is.
[03:42:53.820 --> 03:42:56.860]   You can do a evolutionary biology perspective,
[03:42:56.860 --> 03:42:59.980]   you can talk about some kind of sociology perspective,
[03:42:59.980 --> 03:43:02.420]   psychology perspective, but the experience,
[03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:03.580]   the intensity-- - The experience itself.
[03:43:03.580 --> 03:43:05.740]   - Where you forget, where time,
[03:43:05.740 --> 03:43:07.780]   where reminded becomes an illusion,
[03:43:07.780 --> 03:43:10.700]   and everything just freezes. - Oh my God.
[03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:13.660]   - And then, it's kind of beautiful and painful
[03:43:13.660 --> 03:43:16.660]   to hear you say that, when you've experienced love,
[03:43:16.660 --> 03:43:19.080]   the deepest is when you lost it.
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:21.220]   - Yes, but in a sense, you can say that
[03:43:21.220 --> 03:43:23.980]   you could not have one without the other.
[03:43:23.980 --> 03:43:27.060]   I could not have that deep connection with my father,
[03:43:27.060 --> 03:43:30.020]   like, really, on so, so many levels,
[03:43:30.020 --> 03:43:32.780]   if there weren't a moment, that's how I see it,
[03:43:32.780 --> 03:43:34.940]   and I'm not trying to say that's how everybody should see.
[03:43:34.940 --> 03:43:37.060]   For instance, I respect Ray Kurzweil,
[03:43:37.060 --> 03:43:39.180]   I respect, and I feel, and I almost like,
[03:43:39.180 --> 03:43:41.100]   I feel good bumps right now.
[03:43:41.100 --> 03:43:45.860]   I feel that desire to reconnect,
[03:43:45.860 --> 03:43:51.220]   even if it is in the form of a computer program,
[03:43:51.220 --> 03:43:52.940]   let's be honest about it.
[03:43:52.940 --> 03:43:56.460]   I find it to be very moving, I find it very moving,
[03:43:56.460 --> 03:43:58.460]   and I understand, because he actually didn't have a chance
[03:43:58.460 --> 03:44:01.620]   to spend much time, I think he was 16 or 17,
[03:44:01.620 --> 03:44:03.100]   he was a teenager when his dad died.
[03:44:03.100 --> 03:44:05.660]   I was lucky, because my father died, I was much older.
[03:44:05.660 --> 03:44:08.660]   I've had so many moments with him, but that's not my thing.
[03:44:08.660 --> 03:44:12.140]   I think it is a feature, it's not a bug,
[03:44:12.140 --> 03:44:13.940]   and it sounds crazy, like, I would love,
[03:44:13.940 --> 03:44:16.540]   I would give anything to have him here right now.
[03:44:16.540 --> 03:44:19.700]   Right now, everything I have, I give it away, right now.
[03:44:19.700 --> 03:44:20.740]   Where do I sign?
[03:44:20.740 --> 03:44:24.500]   Just see him for one hour, I promise you, I will.
[03:44:24.500 --> 03:44:29.500]   But I also know that then I'll still lose him,
[03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:32.700]   or I will die, or whatever, you know, so that thing.
[03:44:32.700 --> 03:44:36.740]   So why is it so worth to just hold on to it?
[03:44:36.740 --> 03:44:39.060]   Why, why are we holding on to this?
[03:44:39.060 --> 03:44:41.560]   And I am the first sucker, I'm the first one to hold on,
[03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:43.020]   but I'm questioning it now.
[03:44:43.020 --> 03:44:46.020]   I'm like, is there another way to approach life
[03:44:46.020 --> 03:44:48.220]   where you just, you know how Buddha is like,
[03:44:48.220 --> 03:44:50.140]   (exhaling)
[03:44:50.140 --> 03:44:53.460]   just let it go, enjoy, and let it go,
[03:44:53.460 --> 03:44:56.400]   enjoy, and let it go, is it possible?
[03:44:56.400 --> 03:44:59.260]   - Accept the paradox of it.
[03:44:59.260 --> 03:45:01.420]   - Well, ask me in a couple of years, you know,
[03:45:01.420 --> 03:45:02.660]   I will report.
[03:45:02.660 --> 03:45:06.100]   But I think that, but to my mathematical mind,
[03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:09.680]   it sounds like a very interesting idea, to be honest.
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:14.180]   Because to me, the idea of holding sounds like an impasse.
[03:45:14.180 --> 03:45:16.180]   Because no matter, in all my experience,
[03:45:16.180 --> 03:45:19.940]   and if you look in history, every time somebody's holding,
[03:45:19.940 --> 03:45:21.420]   you know, it's how they said in the Matrix,
[03:45:21.420 --> 03:45:22.980]   whatever has a beginning has an end.
[03:45:22.980 --> 03:45:24.900]   It's like, you cannot go around it.
[03:45:24.900 --> 03:45:27.180]   If you have a beginning, you will have an end.
[03:45:27.180 --> 03:45:29.820]   So then, might as well just enjoy it
[03:45:29.820 --> 03:45:32.940]   and not worry too much about extending it longer.
[03:45:32.940 --> 03:45:34.940]   That's how I see it now,
[03:45:34.940 --> 03:45:36.820]   but maybe tomorrow will be something else, you know?
[03:45:36.820 --> 03:45:38.500]   (laughing)
[03:45:38.500 --> 03:45:41.060]   - Yeah, the rollercoaster of life, the paradox of life.
[03:45:41.060 --> 03:45:41.900]   - Right.
[03:45:41.900 --> 03:45:43.060]   - Edward, you're an incredible human being.
[03:45:43.060 --> 03:45:44.220]   I've been a fan for a long time.
[03:45:44.220 --> 03:45:45.620]   Thank you for writing Love and Math.
[03:45:45.620 --> 03:45:48.480]   Thank you, thank you for being who you are,
[03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:52.060]   being both one of the greatest living mathematicians
[03:45:52.060 --> 03:45:57.060]   and still childlike wanderer of the exploring world.
[03:45:57.060 --> 03:45:59.820]   Exploring how this whole world works,
[03:45:59.820 --> 03:46:01.260]   the nature of the universe.
[03:46:01.260 --> 03:46:03.660]   And thank you so much for speaking with me today.
[03:46:03.660 --> 03:46:04.540]   This is amazing.
[03:46:04.540 --> 03:46:08.040]   - It's been a pleasure, thank you.
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:09.460]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:46:09.460 --> 03:46:10.620]   with Edward Frenkel.

[03:46:16.460 --> 03:46:20.940]   from Sofia Kovalevskaya, a Russian mathematician.
[03:46:20.940 --> 03:46:23.520]   "It is impossible to be a mathematician
[03:46:23.520 --> 03:46:27.040]   "without being a poet in the soul.
[03:46:27.040 --> 03:46:30.140]   "Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time."
[03:46:30.140 --> 03:46:32.720]   (upbeat music)
[03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:35.300]   (upbeat music)
