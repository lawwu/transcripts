[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   The thing that worries me about Gen Z, and I think they'll snap out of it, hopefully,
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.140]   is just the financial nihilism, just the nothing matters. So I'm just going to take these crazy
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.280]   risks and hope something works out because the old nine to five, put it in the 401k,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.060]   build wealth slowly. That's for a prior generation. And this isn't everyone there,
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.540]   obviously, but I think there is a little bit of that nothing matters. So let's just put it on
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.100]   red or black and see what happens. And I think people do graduate from that mindset eventually.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.840]   But again, I think the fact that generation has technology and a risk mindset, I think most of
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.120]   them will be okay. And I think a lot of them are starting to invest earlier and get experience.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.000]   And so even if they blow themselves up trading triple levered ETFs or options, same day options,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.660]   wherever it is, if they're doing it with less money before they start saving and putting stuff away,
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.900]   eventually those habits change and they realize, okay, maybe I need more of a slow and steady approach.
