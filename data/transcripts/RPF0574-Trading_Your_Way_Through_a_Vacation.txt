[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.600]   My name is Joshua, I am your host.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   And today I wanna talk with you briefly
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.960]   about taking a vacation.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.120]   And I'm gonna share an article with you
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   that I recently read that I really enjoyed.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760]   But the impetus for this particular show
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040]   comes from a conversation I overheard
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.000]   in a restaurant last night.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.020]   I was sitting in a restaurant having a little bit of food
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.780]   and I was by myself.
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.640]   And while I was there, I was listening to the couple
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.260]   or to two people at the table next to me talk.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.080]   And there were two ladies
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.040]   and one of the ladies was a single mom.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.720]   And she was sharing with her friend
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   about what she's doing this summer.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.840]   And right now she's working four jobs.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   She's a single mom.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.480]   Her daughter is with her daughter's grandmother
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.520]   right now for the summer.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.840]   And the mom is using this time
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.600]   where she doesn't have to engage in childcare
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.160]   to basically work four jobs
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   and save as much money as she can.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.840]   And she's working hard to save money.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.120]   And her goal for that money
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.060]   is to take her daughter on a vacation.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.620]   Now, I of course applaud that,
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.800]   but my heart went out to this mother
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   because she's stuck in the American rut
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.820]   of spending crazy amounts of money on vacation
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.800]   because of not being able to think creatively
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.000]   about how to do it.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.320]   US Americans, as a general rule
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.600]   and a very strongly applicable stereotype,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080]   vacation very differently
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.280]   than much of the rest of the world.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120]   Now, you can vacation however you want,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.760]   but I don't personally fit in very well
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.620]   to the US American stereotype.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.880]   I first learned this number of years ago.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.380]   I was in college and I was working in,
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.200]   I was living and studying in Costa Rica.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.240]   And I was working with a company
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.400]   that did ecotourism in Costa Rica.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.380]   Ecotourism in Costa Rica is a strong deal.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.000]   We prepared for one of our business school projects.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.040]   We prepared an analysis of ecotourists
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.000]   and we focused on three countries,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.960]   United States of America, Great Britain,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.760]   and Germany, German, German people.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.240]   And the amazing thing between it,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   the amazing reality that we found
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   was that there were strong and clear differences
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.320]   between these three particular cultures.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   Now, I don't remember the exact numbers
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.200]   of how much they would spend,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.920]   but I'll tell you, I'll give you a broad brush
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.600]   that I think is pretty close.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.680]   US Americans will go on vacation in that time.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.700]   They'll go on vacation for one week.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.160]   They'll spend $10,000 on a one week vacation
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.500]   and they'll schedule every single hour of their day
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.600]   with something to do,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.520]   especially something to do that costs money.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.980]   The Brits will go on vacation for a month.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.920]   They'll spend $6,000
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.560]   and they'll have a much more relaxed time.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   And the Germans would go on vacation for two months
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.200]   and spend $5,000 and have a much more relaxed time.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.440]   And it's just interesting because in my own experience,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.200]   I could think back and see exactly that
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.520]   happening again and again,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.000]   where you see that US Americans spend so much money
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.480]   in such a short amount of time
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.200]   and they almost don't know how to do it otherwise.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.120]   And so in conversations I've had with people similar
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.240]   to this mother that I was listening to last night,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.540]   their concept of vacation only involves spending money.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.320]   And it frequently involves spending money
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.000]   at things that are designed to spend money.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   Whether it's go to Disney World
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.680]   or go in the hotel system, et cetera.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.520]   And there are other ways.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.680]   Now, maybe sometime I'll give you my ideas on other ways,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.640]   but I recently read this article
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.960]   in a Mother and Earth News compendium of articles
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.840]   back from the early, mid 1980s.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.640]   And this book was super interesting to me.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.440]   And I really enjoyed this particular story
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   called "Trading Your Way Through a Vacation."
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.720]   I'm gonna share it with you
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.760]   because it shows how one family
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.780]   took a different approach to their vacation.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.800]   Now you might hear this story and you might think,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.200]   oh, I can't even imagine, that is not for me.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.720]   You're entitled to hear that and to think that.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.900]   You can live as you want to live,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.800]   but take this and use it as a creative fodder
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.120]   that will, and design for yourself an appropriate solution
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.780]   for an appropriate vacation methodology
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.660]   that will really help you in the future.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.120]   And enjoy this particular story.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.000]   I thought it was quite fun.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.480]   "Trading Your Way Through a Vacation."
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.400]   We all need a respite now and then,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.320]   but taking a vacation most often means
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.760]   scrimping and saving to meet the expenses
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.340]   of being away from home.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.240]   However, by negotiating trades
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.400]   and turning a vacation into an adventure,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.080]   it's entirely possible to make that break from routine,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.840]   not only pay for itself,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.720]   but be profitable and fun as well.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.440]   One Canadian couple who liked to get away from the city
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.120]   to the Okanagan and Silmalkin Valleys
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.800]   of British Columbia for the summer,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.600]   managed to exchange enough labor and produce
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.740]   to support themselves and their children
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.520]   for an entire three months away from home.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.160]   The couple had previously made friends
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.480]   with an organic farmer
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.400]   and had arranged to help him with his work
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.180]   in return for a reduced price on produce
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.940]   when harvest time came.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.120]   They'd also agreed to bring him some seaweed for fertilizer
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.880]   when they came from their home on the coast,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.120]   where it was freely available to anyone
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   willing to take the time to gather it.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.360]   Foraging for seaweed was one of their
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760]   favorite occupations anyway,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.620]   so the couple didn't mind at all.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.880]   They proceeded to harvest a two-ton truckload
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.760]   of storm-shredded kelp, eelgrass, rockweed,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.620]   and dozens of other varieties of giant algae,
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.860]   all of it seasoned, so to speak,
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.660]   with sand, shell particles, and fine wood debris.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.480]   After collecting this vegetation,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.200]   they spread it out to be washed by the rain.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.000]   Fresh seaweed is too salty for use as fertilizer,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.840]   and dried by the sun.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.080]   Tending and tending it like hay,
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.640]   they eventually had a third of a truckload of choice,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.520]   dry, nutrient-rich fertilizer
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   to take to their farming friend.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.260]   When the couple, their six-year-old son
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.240]   and three-year-old daughter,
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.320]   arrived at the farm in mid-July,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.180]   they found their friend way behind in his hoeing.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.880]   The grass, pigweed, and nightshade
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.000]   were choking his soybeans, squash, corn, and tomatoes
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.800]   so badly that he couldn't keep up with it by himself.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.540]   He immediately offered them a credit of $4 per hour
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.420]   to hoe his fields for him.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.840]   This was all the excuse they needed
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.120]   to pick up their tools and get to work.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.360]   After gently prodding their friend with,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   "How long have we been hoeing so far?"
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.960]   and "What do you think the kids' work is worth?"
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.760]   the couple came right out and asked
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.720]   whether they could swap the whole family's efforts
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.660]   for produce.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:09.920]   Further discussion, further bargaining,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.840]   resulted in a deal that was satisfactory
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.160]   all the way around.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.660]   The family would hoe a certain part of their friend's fields
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.320]   in early summer and be paid in September
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.740]   with 20, 40-pound boxes of tomatoes.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.720]   Then came the question of the seaweed.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.520]   "What do you figure all that fertilizer's worth?"
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.840]   the farmer asked.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.360]   "Well, Hank," said the husband,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.840]   "we've put so much love and labor into the weed
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.080]   that it's beyond price,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.420]   so we'll just have to give it to you."
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.560]   The farmer pulled his beard and chuckled.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.700]   "You know, that's exactly how I feel about my vegetables.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.540]   So while you're here,
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.160]   you just take all the fresh vegetables you can eat."
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.780]   In this way, the land tiller got quality fertilizer
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.260]   for the farm, and the couple wound up
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.180]   with as many onions, new red potatoes, cucumbers,
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.260]   kohlrabi, and ears of sweet corn as they could eat.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.440]   Next, while they were camped out at their friend's,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.600]   they discovered eight damaged fruit ladders,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.860]   ranging from eight to 18 feet,
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.560]   just lying in the grass,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.380]   left over from the time when the farm had been an orchard.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.900]   After a quick huddle with the farmer,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.780]   they had another deal on their hands.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.940]   Using the tools, scraps of lumber,
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.300]   and other odd hardware that they had on hand,
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.580]   it took the couple only a day
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.300]   to put all the ladders back into prime condition.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.580]   Then the farmer selected four for himself,
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.240]   and the couple got the others.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.660]   They were most useful, too, for that from that day on,
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.900]   whenever they negotiated deals
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.660]   with orchard owners to pick fruit,
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.560]   they could always say,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.660]   "We have our own ladders and buckets,"
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.340]   and they'd get the job.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.220]   Both families liked to dry fruits and vegetables,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.420]   and just so happened that the farmer
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.140]   had a plastic-covered dome that warmed up fast
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.780]   when it was set out in the sun.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.300]   So the vacationers arranged a third deal.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.100]   Their friend would provide screening, a staple gun,
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.820]   and free access to his private junk lumber pile,
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.900]   and they would construct eight drying racks
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.460]   covered with fine fiberglass screening.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.380]   Then everyone would share the use of these frames.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.160]   Well, they built the racks and dried some cherries on them,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.620]   but when all was said and done,
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.280]   the couple didn't feel that they really came out even
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.540]   on the exchange.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.460]   As luck would have it,
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.120]   this imbalance was corrected on a later date.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.180]   The couple and their children stayed at the farm
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.140]   for another week before moving on,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.000]   but their swapping experiences didn't end then.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.740]   After untold hours of work in the different orchards,
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.860]   they ended up with 1,200 pounds of cherries
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.860]   and 1,000 pounds of apricots and peaches to take home
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.020]   as a supplement to the cash wages that they were paid.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.480]   Another time, as they were uneventfully driving along
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.000]   at three o'clock in the morning,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.820]   the tractor-trailer truck just ahead
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.060]   began to rain 50-pound sacks of chicken feed
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.460]   along the freeway.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.620]   They salvaged $20 worth of the sacks
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.540]   and finally located a homesteading family
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.980]   that could use the feed.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.540]   However, the homesteader's hens weren't laying many eggs
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.940]   at the time and their goats weren't giving much milk,
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.780]   so the travelers gave them the feed anyway
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.380]   with the promise of something interesting
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.420]   in return at a later date.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.300]   After a summer of traveling and trading,
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.060]   the family returned in mid-September to their friend's farm,
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.660]   only to find him in a bit of a quandary.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.260]   He was burdened with a field of luscious, ripe,
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.340]   organically grown tomatoes for which he had no buyers.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.140]   The local market was glutted,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.540]   and those tomatoes wouldn't sell
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.340]   at even a few cents a pound.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.780]   Yet, 200 miles away over the mountains
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.860]   lay the city of Vancouver, British Columbia,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.540]   where people were paying 10 times as much per pound
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.980]   for tomatoes of poor quality
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.140]   shipped all the way from Mexico.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.980]   The couple's two-ton truck was just sitting idle,
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.120]   and both they and the farmer were interested
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.020]   in turning a handsome profit.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.020]   So, after they all spent the next three days
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.740]   picking and packing tomatoes,
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.180]   the husband started for the coast
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.780]   with nearly 4,000 pounds of perfect fruit
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.860]   and high expectations.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.780]   10 days later, he returned.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.820]   It had been one of those disastrous treks
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.940]   where people don't keep all of their promises
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.340]   and containers unaccountably collapse,
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.660]   where opening hours and ferry ticket takers
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.180]   and food co-op buyers all seem to conspire against you,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.460]   where nothing goes as planned.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.940]   The husband had sold tomatoes, traded tomatoes,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.460]   dumped them on friends' doorsteps,
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.580]   thrown away rotten ones,
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.660]   and he had even taken the time to return home
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.980]   and can 400 pounds of the pulpy fruit.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.980]   When he returned, he gave the farmer enough cash
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.220]   to cover the value of the goods
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.860]   that had survived the journey.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.860]   Still, the family had not only failed
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.980]   to make wages on the deal,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.700]   they'd actually lost money.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.740]   Their friend had accepted the risk of this venture
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.820]   along with them, however,
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.900]   and he compensated them for their loss
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.260]   with 800 pounds of acorn squash on the vine.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.620]   During the husband's absence,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.100]   the wife and children had begun drying and bottling
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.300]   the 20, 40-pound crates of tomatoes
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.320]   they received as part of their July hoeing swap.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.940]   So, they all continued to work on the fruit
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.980]   for more than a week,
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.420]   cutting off tops and bottoms
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.020]   of the juice-filled tomatoes to cook
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.260]   and bottle as sauce,
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.500]   and slicing the meaty centers into thin wheels,
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.080]   which, after four days on the drying racks,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.780]   became tissue-thin slivers of potent flavor.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.580]   It was then that the drying rack swap
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.660]   finally balanced out.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.500]   By the time they'd finished with the tomatoes,
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.480]   it was early October and grape-picking season.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.760]   So, they bade farewell again to their friend on the farm
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.220]   and headed for a vineyard.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.340]   They found a promising one,
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.420]   and the owner allowed them to camp on his property
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.820]   in exchange for helping them harvest grapes.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.940]   In addition, they were allowed to keep a pound of grapes
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.400]   for every 15 pounds they harvested.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.220]   Grape-picking is interesting work.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.660]   You get to eat a lot of the sugary, tart little fruits,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.980]   which slows you down.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.500]   You quickly develop purple hands,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.580]   and occasionally you snip your fingers with the shears
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.440]   or get bitten by one of the mice
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.320]   that seems to savor grapes, too.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.100]   The vacationers continued to barter for things they needed.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.620]   They discovered that the vineyard owner
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.740]   had quite a number of large, sturdy plastic crates
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.260]   designed to either stack or nest,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.700]   and invaluable for shipping wine grapes.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.080]   They were now cracked and useless.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.620]   But the husband mended 10 of them with an electric drill
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.380]   and scraps of thin wire.
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.300]   The owner was so pleased that he gave them
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.300]   five of the handy containers as payment for the work.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.760]   About this time, they decided
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.600]   that they'd picked more than enough.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.460]   They already had more squash, bottled tomatoes,
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.460]   fresh tomatoes, corn, onions,
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.660]   cull plums, and cull apples than they knew what to do with.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.780]   And some of the grapes they'd harvested for themselves
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.940]   were wilting.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.420]   So they borrowed the owner's great press.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.220]   The family pressed 500 pounds of muskets and gave the mash,
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.140]   the pulp left over from the pressing,
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.820]   to the vineyard owner for second wine.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.420]   In the meantime, though, the family found
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.420]   that they had picked $9 worth of grapes,
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.940]   more than they'd earned, and they couldn't pay for them.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.140]   The owner at first agreed
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.140]   that they could make this up the following year.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.100]   But before the group left, he came beaming to their truck
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.060]   to say that the musket mash they'd given him
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.980]   was well worth the overrun.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.540]   Thus, the accounts were balanced after all.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   As the family departed the Similkameen Valley
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.920]   in their weary and heavily burdened truck,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.380]   they found it necessary to make another swap.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.600]   A friend had driven their car out to the valley for them,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.020]   but he was no longer around to drive it back.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.660]   This meant they had two vehicles,
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.320]   the car and the two-ton truck to take home.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.340]   But since the wife didn't drive, they had just one driver.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.380]   Fortunately, they soon met a lady hitchhiker
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.000]   who readily agreed to drive the auto back and return
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.880]   for the free transportation.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.180]   Yet another exchange occurred
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.220]   when they stopped overnight at a hostel.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.260]   There, they happily traded plums, tomatoes,
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.100]   and one crate of grapes for their supper and breakfast.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.000]   And finally, upon arriving home,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.140]   they still had an abundance of grapes and squash
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.700]   that could be traded for other produce,
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.020]   magazines and books,
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.220]   or any number of other items or services.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.520]   "What a summer of hard work," their friends exclaimed
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.220]   when told about the trip.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.700]   Well, it was hard,
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.900]   but it was also a fun-filled adventure.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.660]   They returned healthy and fit,
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.380]   and they had their children right there with them
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.780]   all that time.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.580]   The whole family had made many friends
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.140]   and had experienced firsthand the tremendous effort
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.100]   and care that it took to produce the food they enjoyed
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.280]   in such abundance.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.460]   Now you take that story, do with it what you will,
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.780]   but don't think that in order to take your family
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.460]   on vacation that you have to drive 1,000 miles away,
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.420]   spending $100 a night at a hotel along the way
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.820]   in order to buy tickets to Disney World for 100 bucks a day
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.820]   in order to have a vacation.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.620]   There are other options,
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.500]   and I'll leave it to you to come up
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.700]   with the creative options that will help you.
