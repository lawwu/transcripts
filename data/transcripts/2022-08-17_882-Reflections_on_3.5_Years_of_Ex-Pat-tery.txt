[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.200]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800]   your host, and today I'm going to do a show that I've frankly put off doing for quite
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.880]   a while. We're going to call this Reflections and Comments on Three Years of Expattery,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.860]   but in reality I could also title this episode My Updated Thoughts and Perspectives on My
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.080]   Native Country of the United States of America. Long-time listeners know that I have been
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.680]   an expat from the United States for more than three years now, about three and a half years,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.880]   and along the way I've shared some of the lessons learned with you here on this podcast.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.200]   But I struggle sometimes to want to talk publicly about my personal life for various reasons,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.840]   and so sometimes I don't update my perspectives and opinions very frequently in public, unless
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.040]   someone calls me on a Q&A show. That's usually where you can get me to spill the beans, but
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.160]   I don't eagerly run towards these particular shows. Recently I've spoken to a couple of
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.200]   listeners who basically said, "Oh, well, you think such and such," and I said, "Well, no,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.320]   I don't think such and such," and I realized that I have a duty to you to speak clearly
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.200]   and honestly on things that I have learned along the way. And so I want to share with
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.080]   you some reflections from my own journey of three years of expattery, having lived as
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   an expat for, again, three and a half years now. And I'm doing this because I know that
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880]   this is something that many people consider. It's not something that many people do, but
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.240]   it's something that many people consider. There's been a significant uptick. I hang
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.220]   out on Reddit a decent amount and look around and poke around in some of the expat forums
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.040]   and other places online where people hang out, and I use that as a good way to listen
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.520]   to people. And there's been a significant uptick of Americans over the last months saying,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   "Well, I'm going to leave the United States and go elsewhere," and I read their reasons
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.120]   and listen to what they have to say, and I encourage it to some degree. But I also frequently
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.760]   speak to people who are thinking about leaving the United States, and I myself wind up telling
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.320]   them I don't think it's a good idea, and I explain why. And so today's show is going
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.800]   to be an extended discussion of these topics. At the beginning, I want to lead with the
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.320]   lead, which is simply I believe that the primary reason you should consider leaving your home
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:08.600]   country, be it any country in the world, or including the United States, is based on culture
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.520]   and opportunity. What I mean is, if you like the culture where you are from, I think you
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.320]   should stay there. If you don't like the culture where you're from, I think that's a very good
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.400]   reason for you to leave. And as with most things, I don't think that you should generally
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.980]   be trying to run away from something, but rather I think you should be running to something.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.200]   This is my very best effort to encapsulate what I have learned over the last three and
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.680]   a half years of living the international lifestyle. When I see people successfully expatriate
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.600]   from their home country, move to another country, and be there happily, I think they do that
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:08.380]   most effectively when they find a good cultural fit. I myself will, in my best guess, probably
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.020]   wind up moving my family back to the United States in the coming years. And the reason
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.540]   I think I will wind up doing that has to do with culture, the fact that I'm comfortable
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:27.820]   in the American culture, that culturally I reflect in my own being many American values.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.420]   Now if the American culture continues to change and that culture doesn't reflect who I am,
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:41.060]   then I probably won't do that. But this issue of culture at its core is, I think, one of
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:49.060]   the most important things to consider. Years ago I asked Andrew Henderson, the host of
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.540]   the Nomad Capitalist platform and business, and I asked Andrew, I said, because he talks
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.740]   about leaving the United States. And if you listen closely to his story, his story, grew
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.260]   up in the United States, lived there, went abroad, traveled for many years, and eventually
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.860]   wound up fully expatriating to the point of even renouncing his US citizenship. And I'm
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.820]   using him because he's a public figure and he talks openly about his experience. But
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.460]   if you listen to him, Andrew didn't leave the United States to save money on taxes.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.220]   Andrew didn't renounce his citizenship to have a simpler life. Those are ancillary benefits.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.100]   Andrew's primary motivation for leaving the United States and eventually for renouncing
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.780]   his citizenship is simply that he never felt comfortable as an American. He never felt
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:39.900]   culturally American. So because he never felt comfortably culturally American, for him to
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.380]   leave the United States and eventually end even his citizenship provided him with a greater
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.100]   feeling of freedom. And there have been times, and the times that I've been most happy to
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.100]   not be in the United States has been when I've seen things in the culture that don't
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.420]   reflect me or my values. But the times when I most want to be in the United States are
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.700]   when I feel a sense of cultural longing for the things that do reflect me and my values.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.940]   So I think that culture is the driving force for most people. And then I think that if
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.180]   you're going to leave, you want to be going to something. You want to go into something
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.020]   that you think might be better for you. And that may be a temporary job posting in another
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.820]   place. That might be a tremendous opportunity. It might be going to a land of opportunity
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.060]   or going to pursue something. It might just be wanting to have a cultural adventure for
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.140]   a time and enjoy something different. But you want to be clear that you're not really
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.260]   running away. You're going to something. And again, these things are applicable to
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.780]   people from any country, but I'm very heavily speaking to Americans. As I'll talk later
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.700]   in the show, I believe that most of the things that people are looking for, especially Americans,
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.460]   most of the things that Americans are looking for from another country, are better answered
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:09.060]   by another region, another state, or another city. This is when I think about the questions
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.660]   that people ask. I read Reddit posts, or I read blogs from people who are leaving, or
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.180]   I work with consulting clients who are leaving the country. In many cases, my answer is not
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.340]   you should move to another country. It's simply move to another state. Move to another
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:32.620]   city. And the United States especially is so large and has such diversity of culture.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.980]   Your experience of life will be very different depending on which corner of the country you
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.540]   happen to be in. And it'll be much simpler and almost certainly better for you to simply
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:48.180]   relocate within the country than to try to move to an entirely new country. More on that
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:56.260]   later. As I begin my story, I want you to also adopt this framework for yourself. And
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:03.420]   it's the Plan A, Plan B framework. What I mean is, when people think about expatriating,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:11.300]   they often think about that in terms of a permanent thing. But it doesn't have to be
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.940]   that way. And I think the best language for this is what's commonly used in the international
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:22.460]   industry of Plan A versus Plan B. Let me define the terms. Plan A is a complete and total
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:29.460]   change from one thing to another thing with the idea that this is a permanent change going
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:36.940]   forward. So I live in Miami, Florida. I have decided to move to London, England. And so
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.700]   I get a residence permit for London, England. I pick up my family and I move to London,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.580]   England. And my plan is to be in London for the rest of my life. That's a Plan A change.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.500]   Plan B is I want to have a backup plan to be able to go somewhere if I want to. So using
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.580]   those same countries, perhaps I live in Miami, Florida, but I'd like to have the option
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.220]   to go to London, England in the future if I wanted to. It just so happens that my grandmother
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.260]   is British. And so I'm going to make sure that we go ahead and file for our British
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.380]   citizenship all down the line. Now I hold a British passport and now I have the opportunity
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.880]   in the future if I want to move from Miami to London. I can do that at any point in time
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:26.840]   as a British citizen. Or a Plan B could be, again, we usually come down to passports and
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.860]   residency documents because that's often the necessary thing, but Plan B could be something
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.100]   like this. I live in New York. I love my life in upstate New York. It's a wonderful fit
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.640]   for me. But you know what? I'd like to have a backup plan in case New York weren't a good
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.580]   fit for me for any number of reasons, things that could happen to me. There could be reasons
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:52.420]   why I find myself facing persecution, why I find myself facing prosecution, some issue
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.860]   in my life and I decide it's better. So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and I'll purchase
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.440]   a second citizenship for myself. I'll go to a Caribbean island and purchase a citizenship
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.420]   from one of the Caribbean nations that will sell it to me. It costs about $150,000 for
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.620]   an individual. And then I'll go ahead and set up, you know, I might not necessarily
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.220]   want to live in the Caribbean, so I might set up a residence permit in Europe. There
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.840]   are many countries in Europe that will give me a residence permit for buying property.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.780]   And so I'll go to Europe, I'll purchase property and they'll give me a residence permit. So
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:29.180]   now, if at any point in the future I had to, or I chose to, or I wanted to leave New York
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.740]   and go abroad, I have everything set up. That's a good Plan B.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.460]   When you think about these as Plan A versus Plan B, you'll immediately notice that there's
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:45.980]   not an obvious demarcation between them. What is today a Plan B can become a Plan A, and
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:52.740]   what is today a Plan A can become a Plan B. You can go back and forth between these. But
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.620]   when I'm talking about my comments, you'll hear me talking primarily about the idea of
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.900]   people choosing to leave as a Plan A, meaning I'm just done living in the United States,
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.200]   I'm going to go live somewhere else and I'm never coming back. That is a big commitment
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.820]   and I think it's a commitment that's ill-suited for most people. Not all, but most.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:20.780]   However, establishing a Plan B for yourself, which is largely what I have done, is, I think,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:27.380]   a wonderful plan and strongly recommended. And so as I talk about the lessons that I
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.620]   have learned, recognize that this may all be well and good and true, but you may still
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:37.460]   choose to pursue a Plan B. You may still choose to go and live abroad for two or three years,
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.740]   set up a Plan B, maybe get a second citizenship somewhere, establish a residence permit, learn
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.740]   a new language, travel the world, expose your family to some interesting experiences, and
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.120]   then you may go back to your home country with a much greater appreciation of that home
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:59.200]   country. And that's largely what I have experienced with my time being gone from the United States.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.500]   In some ways, well, in many ways, I appreciate the United States more than I ever did. And
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.020]   I'm going to elaborate some of those things that I appreciate towards the back half of
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.500]   the show. In some ways, I've never felt better than being gone in the United States. And
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.580]   it's that mixture of emotions that I think is common to most expatriates, that you can
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.600]   see things with a little bit more clarity, and you can appreciate the good things that
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.100]   each place has to offer. Let me share now, with that line of thinking, a little bit of
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:36.700]   my backstory and tell you why I myself left the United States. Originally, I simply wanted
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:43.740]   a Plan B. And there were two aspects of my desire for a Plan B that were important. They
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.180]   were avoiding negative outcomes, of which there were three basic outcomes that I was
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:55.500]   worried about, and also preparing for positive outcomes. There were some things that I really
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.660]   wanted that I felt could be well positioned for on the positive side. Let me begin with
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:08.980]   the negative outcomes. And as I elaborate on these three issues, you'll hear me say
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.060]   in a moment that on most of these issues, I'm not nearly as worried as I once was. And
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.700]   so while I would do it over again, because I could be wrong, it's actually, I've become
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.940]   much more optimistic about each of these three factors. Let me go over them. The number one
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:30.140]   reason or the number one negative outcome that I was seeking to solve for myself and
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:36.060]   my family by leaving the United States and establishing a Plan B was the potential negative
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:45.460]   impacts of excessive government debt. I looked around and I observed for many years that
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:53.060]   the United States government continues to in debt itself to a staggering degree, and
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:14:02.380]   there is no real plan for any reasonable way to minimize that debt or to make any measurable
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:09.060]   progress towards paying it off. And since I don't know what the long-term consequences
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:15.140]   of that might be, I worry that I'd like to have a plan to insulate myself and my children
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:22.140]   from any negative long-term consequences. People, when talking about government debt,
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.900]   many responsible people say, "We are indebting our grandchildren. We're borrowing money that
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.340]   we're going to expect our grandchildren to pay back." After many years of hearing that
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.180]   and thinking about it, I thought to myself, "Why should my grandchildren have to pay back
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.020]   money that their grandparents borrowed? That doesn't make any sense." And what if that
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:46.380]   were significant? As a financial planner, clients have expressed to me their concern
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:52.580]   about the risk of increasing tax rates due to this high level of government indebtedness.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.740]   And they've basically, almost unanimously said, "I think tax rates are going to go up
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.220]   because we're borrowing money and at some point it's going to have to be paid back."
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.340]   And so if you think about that, wouldn't you like to have an option to not have to pay
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.820]   high tax rates if you didn't want to? Well, as an American, you have to do some extra
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:19.660]   planning in order to get yourself that option. And I wanted to have in place a system where
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:27.620]   I and my children could be free of any future encumbrances if we wanted to or if we chose
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.100]   to. I didn't feel it was fair for my children that they would be obligated to a lifetime
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.740]   of servitude for the foolish decisions that their grandparents and their great-grandparents
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:42.620]   made. And so I wanted a plan B. I wanted a second citizenship. I wanted the chance for
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.660]   them to live abroad, be citizens of other nations, so that if they didn't want to have
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.300]   anything to do with the United States, they could make that choice in the future.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   Now on this issue, let me talk about it for a moment. I don't think, you might share this
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:05.140]   concern but you might not be willing to actually go through and set up a plan B. And I don't
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:11.940]   think it would be foolish of you to ignore this issue. Let me explain. At this point
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.820]   in time, it's my opinion that the debt will never be paid back. The operating assumption
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.940]   of those who believe that taxes are going to be raised to pay back the debt is that
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.940]   the debt will be paid back. And I now don't believe that the debt will be paid back. I
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:34.540]   could be wrong, but let me explain why. First, all of my experience in life has shown me
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.900]   that paying back national debt or running a budget surplus is simply not a priority
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.140]   for government. There's only one time in my entire lifetime that I'm aware of where there
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.700]   has actually been a government surplus, and I believe it was one year under President
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.260]   Bill Clinton in the mid to late 90s. I remember it because that was a time where I was starting
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.700]   to get involved in politics and I would read US News and World Report every week and listen
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.540]   to NPR every day on my way to school. I remember all the stories about what are we going to
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.620]   do with this budget surplus? How are we going to spend the money? And nobody in that conversation
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:14.020]   seriously said we should use the money to pay down the national debt. It just wasn't
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.620]   really a thing. It was all about how could we spend the money otherwise. And my entire
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:24.060]   lifetime the government has run in the red and they borrow the money, borrow more money.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.140]   And those numbers just increase and increase and increase. So there are a couple of outcomes
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:36.100]   that are possible. One outcome that is possible is what many of the modern monetary theorists
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:42.660]   believe that government, because of its unique role, can basically do this forever. You get
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.260]   the, what's her name, the girl that wrote that book, Stephanie Kelton. She wrote the
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:54.820]   book The Deficit Myth. And basically those proponents would argue that hey, the government
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.020]   can just borrow money indefinitely. Maybe they're right. I always wonder if they're
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:04.180]   right then why do they think we need to raise taxes? And so basically nobody believes in
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.380]   the extreme form because they somehow think we still need to have tax revenue. So there's
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.620]   a balance somewhere, but who knows what that balance is. Nobody predicts a specific number.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.220]   Nobody predicts a certain thing. We just don't know exactly what the number is. Maybe it
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.940]   can happen. It can go on indefinitely. On the other hand, maybe the catastrophists are
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:29.100]   correct. Maybe the catastrophists are correct that everything's going to implode. The massive
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:35.140]   national debt is going to lead to untold money printing and economic collapse. And basically
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:41.100]   our entire modern economy is going to collapse and we're going to return to horse and buggy
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.740]   and plowing in the field with a single bottom plow to feed our families and basically shooting
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.140]   each other in the streets. It's possible. It has happened, meaning civilizations have
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:58.060]   collapsed. It's hard to imagine a civilization collapsing quite so spectacularly, but it
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.700]   has happened and very well could happen. So those are two extreme cases.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.660]   Are there some moderate cases? Well, I think the moderate cases are, we of course have
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:15.380]   the example of Japan, which has had the great economic malaise going on three decades now,
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.260]   two decades, three decades. And so we could have a situation of just massive economic
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:26.740]   malaise due to plummeting population figures, due to an upside down economy. Maybe that's
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:33.620]   a figure, that's something that could happen. What I think is probable, in my opinion, if
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:42.380]   I had to put money on it, is what now deceased economist Gary North calls the "Great Default."
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.220]   And basically that the obligations are so large that eventually the government will
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.280]   default on those obligations. So we can call this the "Great Default." Basically a form
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.620]   of bankruptcy. To me this seems probable. And so I expect the government of the United
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.100]   States and the government of many countries around the world to simply default on their
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:10.140]   obligations. I don't think that will be a sudden thing of one day we're just going to
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.820]   stroke a pen and ignore all of our obligations. I think that's unlikely. I think it's more
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:25.460]   likely that that will look like a multi-year, who knows, multi-decade process of basically
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:31.340]   government entities simply not following through on their promises. And I think that there's
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:37.380]   good historical precedent for this position. If we look back we see, for example, Social
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.260]   Security. Social Security has been bankrupt multiple times. And the Social Security organizers
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.740]   have defaulted multiple times on their promises. They said, "We're going to start this at 62."
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.180]   Then they changed the ages. "Then we're going to give this money to you tax-free." Then
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.860]   they start taxing a portion of it. And so these are examples of defaults. But they're
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.460]   not sudden precipitous things. They're things that everyone looks at and says, "Oh, that's
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.780]   a reasonable normal thing. Obviously we don't have the money, so we're going to go ahead
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.780]   and change these benefits." And so if you look at the entitlement programs of the United
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.500]   States, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, then this is likely to happen. And some of
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.220]   that default is public. "Well, we're going to institute means testing on Social Security
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.060]   now." Well, it's public. "Now you're not going to get the money that was promised to
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.180]   you. That saves us some money. Helps us to milk things along for a few more years." Some
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:29.460]   of the default is circumstantial. Several years ago I did an essay, or did a podcast,
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.180]   highlighting a news story from Maine. And it was an example of the broken Medicaid system
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.540]   in Maine. The news report profiled how there are many residents of Maine who are fully
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:45.620]   entitled to Medicaid benefits, things like home health care, but that they simply aren't
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.460]   able to collect on those benefits because there are no workers who are willing to provide
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:57.060]   the services at the rates promised by the government. And so effectively those people
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.180]   can't collect their Medicaid benefits because they're choosing to live in the state of Maine
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:07.380]   and the system is broken. Even though the government will write the checks, the whole
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:13.180]   labor supply is simply non-existent. And so that's a form of default. I think if you look
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:21.300]   across the economy, that's a very likely outcome, especially for the unfunded liabilities. Now
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:27.380]   for the on-budget liabilities, who knows what will happen. The reality is sovereign governments
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:34.700]   default on their debt frequently. Usually it's not the United States. Usually it's Argentina,
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:40.300]   perhaps Russia in coming weeks and months. But it's not usually the United States. But
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.900]   there's no fundamental reason why it couldn't be the United States. And so if we look at
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   inflation as a form of default, if we look at rebasement of currency as a form of default,
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.300]   you go back and you look at how the US has handled its money supply, if you look at how
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.660]   the currency has changed several times, you have the first national banks in the late
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:03.660]   1700s that collapsed, and then you have all of this. We look at it and when you live in
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:09.340]   a time of stability, it seems hard to imagine. But if you look at history, you recognize
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.340]   this default has happened many times before, it can happen again. And what exact form it
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:21.180]   will take, I don't know, but it's happened quite a lot. What about raising taxes? Well,
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.020]   it's certainly possible that taxes could be raised, but here is my observation. First,
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:33.180]   since World War II, tax revenues in the United States have never gone above 25% of GDP. They're
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.220]   actually, they have actually been remarkably stable. You can go through history and you
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:44.540]   can find some periods at which the marginal tax rates were truly astounding. Go back to
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:51.580]   the 60s, 70s, you find 90% marginal tax rates, it's astounding. But realistically, those
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:24:00.140]   tax rates were never levied as directly as it would seem by the number itself. Because
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.700]   there were far more loopholes, there were far more exceptions, etc. So the trend of
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:11.900]   the last several decades has been generally declining tax rates mixed with generally closing
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:18.620]   out any loopholes or exceptions. It's very difficult to find any truly spectacular tax
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:24.620]   loophole in the US tax code today. My whole life, I've pretty much been looking for them
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.420]   as a financial planner. What are they? There just aren't that many. There really aren't.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:35.580]   There used to be a lot more, but they've been steadily closed by legislation. And so,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:43.500]   if you look back over the last 10 to 20 years, you see a striking stability of overall tax rates
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:50.380]   and tax collections. And it's been my observation that politicians talk about changing taxes,
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:58.300]   in order, tax rates, in order to curry political favor. But when elected, they don't actually
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:05.100]   change much. Republicans generally seem to talk about lowering taxes. They gain in office,
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:10.860]   well, they lower it 3%. We go from a marginal bracket of 39.5% to 37%, top marginal bracket.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:17.340]   Okay, big deal. Democrat comes into office, we go from 37% to 39%. Whatever, big deal.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:25.340]   They're just generally small changes on the margin. And I have also observed that during
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:35.820]   times of economic uncertainty, there is a strong bipartisan willingness to not raise taxes and
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:43.740]   often to cut taxes. So this shows me that regardless of what they say, politicians understand
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:51.820]   that heavy tax rates tend to minimize economic activity. So I think that the United States,
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:58.060]   being one of the most sophisticated governments in the world, from the perspective of good,
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:05.820]   reliable data, good understanding of the numbers, the trends, etc., I think the United States is
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:14.220]   pretty well locked in its ideal position on the Laffer curve. The Laffer curve is an idea
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:21.660]   expressed by economist, Art Laffer, I think, that basically argues that if you raise tax rates too
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:27.020]   much, people minimize their economic activity and your tax collections go down. If you lower tax
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.540]   rates too much, then the government doesn't get the maximum amount of tax revenue that it could get
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.500]   by charging a higher rate. And I think that the United States has pretty well optimized its Laffer
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:44.140]   curve. And I say that largely from simply personal experience, meaning you very rarely meet an
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:49.740]   American who will actually follow through on leaving the country in order to change tax rates,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:56.860]   in order to eliminate taxes or lower them. The US taxes are not low, but they're also not
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:03.820]   excessively high. It's kind of that really awkward, lukewarm middle ground where getting
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.700]   out is not really worth it, but staying in and really going is not really worth it. And so
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:16.540]   it's hard for Americans to give up on the United States just to save on some taxes. And on a global
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.620]   basis, the United States is pretty competitive. And so I think that's an expression, a natural,
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.980]   practical expression of the Laffer curve, that we've pretty well dialed in where we need to be.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:32.220]   And the United States has maximized, government is maximizing its revenue, while trying not to
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:40.860]   overplay its hand and suppress economic activity too much. So all of that said, that I don't,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:46.460]   I'm not that worried about the situation that my children will face. I'm very happy that I built a
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:52.940]   plan B for them, but I'm not that worried about it economically. And I think that if we bring into
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.020]   the conversation other macroeconomic trends, which I will talk about in the back half of the show,
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:04.300]   I think there are good reasons to believe strongly in the economic future of the United States,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:10.700]   and not to be excessively pessimistic. So the first reason I wanted a plan B was to avoid
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:18.220]   the negative outcome of excessive government debt. The second reason I wanted a plan B
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:26.780]   was to avoid having to pay immoral taxes for myself. I had a strong desire to be able to
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   legally avoid paying immoral taxes without running the risk of imprisonment. Let me explain, because
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:40.140]   here I'm not arguing from the perspective of, "I don't want to pay taxes," as meaning selfish,
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.420]   I want to keep my money. It's perfectly fine. Tax avoidance is a perfectly reasonable activity.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:50.460]   Rather, I was very concerned about being able to look myself in the mirror and feel proud about
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:56.780]   the man staring back at me, simply based upon what the money is used for. And there were two issues
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:03.580]   that have bothered me for years. The first is simply war taxes. I'm not a pacifist,
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:13.020]   but I do believe that warfare should only be waged in moral circumstances, which is self-defense.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:20.940]   I do not believe that military power should be used to try to make more money or expand empire.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.700]   I believe that's dangerous and immoral. And since that's something that my own native country has
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:36.780]   done repeatedly and regularly for a very long time, I've often felt very guilty of participating
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.580]   in that system in any way. If you've never thought about this, let me give a modern example.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:51.580]   I think sentiment is pretty, not universal, but pretty strongly united that the actions of the
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:59.340]   state of Russia invading its neighbor, Ukraine, are immoral, that it's an immoral invasion from
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:06.220]   one nation state to another. I want you to imagine yourself as a Russian citizen, living in Russia,
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:12.300]   paying taxes to the Russian government. I want you to imagine that you believe
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:21.020]   that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is immoral. And now ask yourself how you feel supporting
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.980]   that government and sending tax money that is being used to murder innocent people in a
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:36.700]   neighboring country. How would you feel about that? If you can imagine yourself in that situation as a
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:42.220]   Russian and then bring that back to your home country, you can see some of the discomfort that
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:48.140]   some people have. Now, there are a lot of Americans who don't reflect on the behavior of their
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.780]   government in that way, and there are a lot of good arguments to look at where you say, "Well,
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:59.820]   maybe it's different." For example, a Russian could look at the situation and say, "The only
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:06.300]   way that my country can be protected from foreign invaders is for us to control a significant amount
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:13.180]   of territory so that we can have defense through depth. After all, we as Mother Russia, we have
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.980]   been invaded how many times? I mean, five times, something like that. We've lost hundreds of
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:23.500]   millions of people in these vicious wars, and we've learned that the only possible way for us
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:29.820]   to protect ourselves is to basically keep our nation with borders that it had when the Soviet
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.860]   Union was intact." It's my understanding, I'm no expert on Russian history, but it's my understanding
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:40.700]   that basically the Soviet Union was the first time where Russia could actually control and protect
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.820]   itself from external invasion because of controlling all of the strategic geography.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:55.500]   So you could argue that Russia's actions are a result, or excuse me, you could argue that
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:02.460]   Russia's actions are morally defensible by providing for the defense of Russia. This is
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:09.260]   where you go and you say, "Look, NATO has aggressed upon us. NATO is expanding at our flank, and the
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:13.900]   United States and its allies and all the NATO allies are messing around, and they're meddling
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.060]   in our elections and all kinds of things." And that's basically what people have pointed to,
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.860]   to say that this was inevitable. And you could look at that and you could believe it, but you
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.500]   could also pull back and you could say, "But what's the actual effect of this? Like, the actual effect
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.540]   here is this is not right." And thus, should you pay taxes to your government that are being used
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:39.020]   to support that war effort? As I record this in mid-August 2022, it's basically the one-year
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:45.980]   anniversary of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. As perhaps a very good recent example, I want you
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:53.420]   to think about what happened in that withdrawal. Think about, especially, the lives of the 10
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:33:00.220]   innocent people that were lost when a US drone fired a missile at their car and at their compound.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:10.780]   If you or I go out and kill 10 innocent people and then say, "Oh, it's a mistake," you or I are
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.420]   held morally accountable for it and legally accountable for it. Saying it was a mistake
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.020]   doesn't mean we won't be held accountable. But look at what happened. Look at what the US
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.260]   government did with impunity a year ago. Killed 10 innocent people, most of them children,
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:30.140]   and said, "Well, it was bad intelligence. We got bad intelligence." And some random officer in the
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:36.540]   army comes out, makes an apology, but that's it. Nobody faced any legal problems, nobody was
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.500]   prosecuted for war crimes, nobody was held accountable for the innocent loss of life of 10
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:48.140]   innocent people. So you can argue against it, say, "That's the fog of war," and it is, right?
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:54.700]   That's what happens. But why was there the war in the first place? So that's the war tax issue,
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:01.100]   and I've always felt uncomfortable with supporting the violence and contributing in any way to the
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.820]   death of millions and millions of people around the world. But that's never been a big, huge
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.380]   motivation for me to actually act, because although what I've said is true, it's just kind of the way
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.300]   it always has been, right? I've never not grown up and I've never not lived in the empire, I've never
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.740]   not lived in a situation where it could happen all around the world. And for every issue that you look
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:28.140]   at, you can argue your way through it. You could say, "Well, those people, the reason those 10
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.980]   innocent people in Afghanistan were killed was because all of the American soldiers were
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:41.660]   attacked the day before, and there was a soldier killed, and so that was fair and just arguing
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.700]   back." And you say, "Well, why were the soldiers there in the first place?" Well, the reason the
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:48.540]   American soldiers were there was because — nobody even remembers, right? There were weapons of mass
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.180]   destruction. Oh, no, there weren't. Oh, they're harboring Osama bin Laden. And so you can argue
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.740]   your way back through, but at the end of the day, you basically get to a utilitarian view,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.860]   ethical view, that says, "The reason the soldiers are there is because we felt it was better to
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.940]   fight a war on the other side of the world than to worry about people sending soldiers to our
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:13.020]   borders." So the war taxes thing is a big deal for some people, but it's just not — it's always been
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:18.460]   that way, and it's really hard to say, "I'm going to change things significantly." What finally
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:28.620]   caused me to act, however, was the 2015 political season. Specifically, prior to the 2016 presidential
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:36.220]   election, then frontrunners Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunners for
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.620]   the candidacy. Eventually, it was Hillary Clinton that won the Democratic nomination.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:47.580]   Both of them pledged that if elected president, they would end something called the Hyde Amendment.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:53.420]   And the Hyde Amendment is an amendment that happens in — I think it's the budget, annual budget,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:59.900]   that basically, ostensibly, prohibits the use of federal taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:06.780]   For me, abortion is a very, very serious and important moral issue.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:17.900]   I understand abortion to be the intentional killing of an innocent baby, which is murder.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:27.740]   And when I look at that, and I think about my money being used to pay for the murder of the
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:34.380]   most innocent and the most helpless among us, the people who have genuinely never done anything
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:43.340]   wrong, that makes my blood run cold, to think that I would be complicit in that financially.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.940]   Now, in many ways, I'm complicit by allowing it to happen, but it's very hard to know what to do
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:56.460]   and how to keep this from happening. But to say that I'm now actively supporting this
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:02.860]   with my taxpayer tax dollars is utterly repulsive to me personally.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:11.740]   And I thought, "How on earth could I live in a country where I'm using my taxpayer dollars to
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:17.020]   support this? This is awful. How do I look at my children and be proud of their father
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:23.340]   for doing that?" And so it seemed inevitable to me, and I had no idea what to do.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:29.580]   It's a great, great moral crisis for many people. I'll explain the moral crisis in a moment.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:38.700]   So in 2016, when the presidential election happened and Donald Trump won an upset victory,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:45.580]   an unexpected victory, I felt like I had gotten a major reprieve. I felt just this incredible load
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:51.980]   go off of my shoulders, where I thought, "Wow, I was just released from this incredible moral
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.300]   quandary." And I made myself a promise on election night 2016. I promised. I said,
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:03.660]   "By the time the next election happens, I will not be so
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:16.940]   exposed to the vagaries of modern politics. I will not be so vulnerable to this."
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:22.300]   Because I felt such an intense wave of relief. I didn't expect President Trump to win.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   I expected Hillary Clinton to become president. And so I felt this intense wave of relief wash
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.100]   over me that I had gotten a reprieve. And I promised myself that I would never be as vulnerable
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:39.260]   again on the outcome of a political election as I felt I was in 2016. I didn't have a clear plan
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.540]   of exactly what to do, but it was a strong personal commitment. And I felt that way because
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:52.060]   I didn't see how... I didn't think that... I never trusted Donald Trump. I thought he was a liar
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:57.980]   through and through and a man of low moral character. And as such, I felt, I believed that...
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.660]   I was shocked that he won the presidency, and I thought that his presidency would be a disaster.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.900]   And I didn't see how he could win again. And so I felt like I had been given four years,
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:12.220]   and that I shouldn't presume upon anything after that. And so that was a big influence for me.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.460]   Let me explain why I said I wanted to be legally able to avoid immoral taxes without running the
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:24.620]   risk of imprisonment. When you look at tax resistance or tax protesting, not paying taxes
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:29.340]   because you're upset about the tax collection, it takes many forms, right? If you go back in
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:34.460]   Radical Personal Finance, I probably first talked about this when I interviewed David Gross of the
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.940]   Pickett Line back in the first couple dozen episodes of Radical Personal Finance. There's
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:44.620]   nothing new here to the show. But if you look at it, you have basically a couple of roads that you
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:50.380]   can go down. Let's assume that you don't want to pay taxes for whatever reason. Let's assume,
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.140]   though... No, I can't say for whatever reason. Let's assume that you don't want to pay taxes
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:59.660]   because you feel like the payment of taxes is morally abhorrent to you for some reason.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:07.420]   You have two directions you can go. You can go down the illegal tax protesting direction,
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:13.100]   where you're consciously breaking the law, or you can go down the legal path of tax protesting.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:18.540]   Let's start with the illegal path first. This is the thing that most people think of first.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.580]   Government shows up, says, "Here's a tax bill. You owe us this money." And you say,
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:27.340]   "I ain't gonna pay it. Stuff it. I'm not gonna pay it." That's illegal tax protesting.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:34.060]   There are many people who have done it, do it, and have done it. It's happened all around the
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:40.140]   world. You see these revolts where people come in. I remember a few years ago, I loved it. My
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.940]   family and I were driving through Mexico. We passed through a toll plaza. All the farmers were there.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.620]   They had shut down the toll plaza. They'd opened things up, and they were just staging a protest at
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:53.260]   the toll plaza. Basically, the central federal government of Mexico City wasn't listening to them.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:58.380]   They regularly go in. They storm the toll plaza. They open it up to try to get the government to
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.020]   pay attention by the government losing revenue. All around the world, there are examples of this,
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:07.900]   and there have been many examples throughout history. Read David Gross's book called "The
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.620]   99 Lessons from Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns," or something like that. You can
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:19.580]   find all kinds of examples of this in history. The challenge with this line of tax protesting
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:24.300]   is that it's very hard for Christians to argue that they should participate.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.900]   One of the things that is unique about the teachings in the New Testament, the teachings
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:35.900]   of Jesus, the teachings of the early apostles, is that there is a unanimous agreement that
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:41.340]   Christians should pay their taxes. Jesus said, "Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:46.860]   Give unto God the things that are God's." When there were various tax issues, Jesus specifically
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.180]   at one point made a coin appear out of a fish's mouth so that his disciples could pay the temple
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:59.740]   tax. Paul, Peter spoke very, very clearly about taxes, paying taxes. And so it's very, very hard
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:05.980]   for a Christian to argue from a biblical basis that he shouldn't pay his taxes. You say, "Well,
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:12.140]   maybe the government that they were under was not as wicked as the government of our day."
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:18.780]   And I've just always found that risible. Think about this. Jesus said, "Give unto Caesar the
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.740]   things that are Caesar's. Give unto God the things that are God's," knowing full well that he was
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:30.540]   going to be murdered as an entirely innocent man by the government of his day, to which he was
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:39.900]   saying, "Pay taxes." You think about Peter and Paul saying, "Pay taxes." Their compatriots were
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:45.900]   being dunked in oil and stuck on sticks to be used as human torches in Nero's garden,
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:54.540]   and they still said, "Pay taxes." So you say, it's just hard. You can't argue that the government
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:43:00.140]   was any better than today, and you can argue in many ways it was significantly worse. So it's just
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:05.420]   hard to make that argument. Then the practical effects of not paying taxes is imprisonment. If
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.260]   you care about freedom, you've got to avoid imprisonment. Imprisonment always comes with
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:15.500]   all kinds of knock-on effects. I just imagine myself with my children, and I'm stuck in prison
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.300]   for being a tax protester. And, "Mommy, why is Daddy not here?" "Well, Daddy's in prison." "Why
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:25.020]   is Daddy in prison?" "Because he didn't want to pay taxes that funded foreign wars and abortion."
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:32.060]   "Well, Dad, but what about me? Do I not have an obligation to try to stay out of prison for my
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:37.820]   children? If I'm put there through no fault of my own, if I'm unjustly imprisoned and I've done
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:43.660]   nothing wrong, okay, but don't I have an obligation to try to care for my wife and care for my
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:49.900]   children and care for my community by following the law?" To me, it seems you do. So I can't,
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:55.580]   in good conscience, go down the illegal side of tax protesting. What about the legal side of tax
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:02.380]   protesting? So you can be a tax protester by simply changing behavior and following the law.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:07.900]   You don't want to pay the toll on the toll road? You can go on the other road. You don't want to
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:14.860]   pay the gas tax? You can not drive a car. You don't want to pay the war tax? You can lower your
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:21.180]   income below the taxable threshold and simply not owe any taxes. And in the United States, you can
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:28.060]   do this and still live a very agreeable lifestyle, depending on the personal deductions and credits
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:34.140]   to which you're entitled. The number of children I have, I could earn about $100,000 a year and not
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:41.180]   pay any federal income taxes. So I could do fine and not pay federal income taxes if I run a
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.340]   business. Perhaps I put together a couple of good businesses. I take the appropriate business
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:49.820]   deductions. I make contributions to a retirement account. I take my child tax credits. I can take
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.300]   any deductions to which I'm entitled by law, and I just intentionally keep my wages below the tax
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:01.900]   threshold. I can do that, and I can wind up paying a zero dollar tax line for many, many years. So
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:08.940]   that's one form of tax protesting. The problem for me is also back to that, I imagine, my children.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.020]   "Daddy, why are we poor?" You know, like, "Well, we're poor because I don't want to pay taxes."
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.340]   "Why don't you want to pay taxes?" You know, blah, blah, blah, because of these reasons. "But,
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.020]   Daddy, aren't you supposed to be a financial advisor? Why are we poor? Like, aren't you
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.700]   supposed to know what you're talking about?" And that's just always bothered me. So along the way,
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:33.100]   I realized at one point in time that there was a solution to my moral quandary, and the solution
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:42.380]   was to change who had taxing authority over me. I don't believe that I'm obligated, morally
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:48.380]   obligated, as a free man in a free condition, not living under slavery, not living under a system
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:54.540]   where I have to make the choice to stay put, not morally obligated to remain in the United States
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:02.540]   and to remain as a U.S. citizen. And I realized I could solve my moral quandary by leaving,
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:09.260]   and that by doing so, I would be behaving uprightly and righteously in my actions,
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:14.140]   haven't broken any laws, I would be able to maintain my integrity,
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:20.940]   but I would also not be burdened by this idea that I couldn't live up to my potential.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:31.900]   Very simple. I could leave the United States, go to St. Kitts and Nevis, buy a citizenship from St.
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:37.660]   Kitts and Nevis. I don't even need one for my whole family, I just need one for me. $150,000.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:44.300]   I could purchase a home and set up a lifestyle on the island of St. Kitts and Nevis. I can earn
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:50.540]   $100 million a year and pay $0 of income taxes. St. Kitts and Nevis taxes based upon
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:58.620]   import fees and duties, they don't tax wages, profits, etc. And I could live legally,
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.580]   completely tax-free. I could even go back to the United States as a tourist, go back for three,
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:08.940]   maybe three months a year, sometimes up to four months per year, be a tourist,
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:15.100]   have no tax obligations, visit my family, visit my loved ones, and have resolved the moral quandary.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:22.540]   And I thought, I don't know that I want to do that, but I want to have the ability to do that
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:30.060]   if I want to. So let me put this in place. Because I imagined, I thought, you know,
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.620]   President Trump probably president for four years, Republicans wound up doing what they always do,
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:42.460]   lose the Congress, lose the Senate, etc. But I thought, after President Trump, what if it's
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:47.980]   Hillary Clinton again, or Bernie Sanders, or in this case, Joe Biden? I don't want to be dependent
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:56.220]   on the government and them removing this law and my facing this moral conundrum. So I started taking
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:01.180]   action to make sure that I wasn't in that situation, to where if the day that a new president
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:06.860]   was elected, or the day that a new Congress proposed a law that I disagreed with, I could
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:13.420]   renounce my citizenship and be completely free. That was a huge deal for me. May not be for you,
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:20.140]   but it was a huge deal for me because it resolved my problem in what I saw as an honorable way.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:26.220]   Number three is simply that I was concerned about my potential loss of
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:33.580]   personal and physical freedom. One of the court cases in years that really hit me hard was
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:40.380]   when Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to two life sentences plus 40 years for building a website
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:48.780]   that enabled commerce among unknown individuals. That court case struck me to the core.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:57.340]   And I had grown up believing in the legitimacy of the court system, believing in fair jury trials
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:03.820]   and all that. I still hold out hope that that is the best provider for freedom. I believe a jury
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:13.820]   trial is the ultimate bulwark against tyranny, because any juror on a jury trial can exercise
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:21.020]   his discretion to rule on the guilt of the subject and also on the validity of the law.
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:30.140]   That's jury nullification. And so you can nullify as a juror, you can nullify any law that you think
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:36.700]   is immoral. So I believe that that is helpful, but it's really frustrating when you see great
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:45.420]   injustices like Ross Ulbricht being done. It's just a scandalous, scandalous scenario.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.780]   And on the one hand, I generally try to stay optimistic about the future of the United States,
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:56.940]   and I genuinely am optimistic. What I mean is, let me slow down and explain some background.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:05.180]   If you were to go back in the history of the United States, you have a very stark difference
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:10.780]   between what I'll speak widely as the first hundred years versus the second hundred years.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.980]   Now, of course, I know that the nation has been around for more, but just want to highlight this
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:23.420]   hundred-year distance. Go back just over a hundred years ago. Go back to just before World War I,
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:30.620]   U.S. involvement in World War I, 1914 to 1918. Go back to the year before World War I, 1913,
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:36.140]   just over a century ago. The average citizen in the United States
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:45.980]   had no contact in any way, shape, or form with the federal government of the United States
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:53.900]   on a daily, weekly, monthly, annual basis except for the Postal Service.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:01.100]   It was literally the only federal agency or federal body that the average citizen had any
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:10.460]   contact with. No income taxes, no EPA, no Department of Education, no anything except
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:19.740]   the Federal Postal Service. That was it. Since that time, and even like travel restrictions,
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:28.220]   I often get accused by my Republican conservative friends of being a liberal Democrat because I
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.180]   support open borders. I don't believe that the United States or any country should have
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:38.940]   restrictions on who can and can't enter the country for non-criminal persons. I say, "Well,
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:44.780]   you liberal. I just want to go back to the world that existed up till World War II. Prior to World
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:50.940]   War II, with the exception of a very short time in the Civil War and World War I, prior to World
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.340]   War II, the United States never had passport controls. Anybody could come into the country,
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.580]   anybody could leave the country, no passport controls, no restrictions on immigration,
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:07.100]   anybody could come. Since then, what do you have? You have the growth of the welfare state
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:13.020]   and you have the growth of tyranny. So you didn't have to have a passport to come and live in the
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:19.820]   United States or anything prior to that point in time. And so I consider that to be, in many cases,
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:27.180]   an ideal situation, is that we should have freedom. But if you look back in the last 100
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:33.340]   years and you reflect on what I just described, no income tax, no giant federal government invading
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:39.100]   every aspect of your life, various state and local governments engaging in the principles
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:43.900]   of federalism to run their societies how they believed, people able to access and influence
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.980]   those governments because they were more to a human scale. But you compare that to the last
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:53.820]   100 years, the trend is, in many cases, at least legislatively, universally bad for freedom.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:59.740]   Today, you and I commit on estimate three felonies a day in the United States, we just have no idea
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:06.780]   what they are. And you have this ever-growing body of laws that just grows and grows and grows,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.380]   what, 60,000 pages a year, something like that, of new laws to which we're subject and we don't
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:15.900]   even know what they are. It's so bad that when Congress passes laws, which is rare enough,
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:22.060]   they pass laws they don't even read, multi-thousand page laws, the legislators have a couple days to
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:27.740]   read them. And so it's just a farce, it's a joke. So that's the negative view. And I am concerned
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:34.380]   about the negative view because those laws do have long-range impact. On the other hand,
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:43.500]   the positive view that I do subscribe to is that on a practical basis, an individual today
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:52.220]   has far more ability to live freely than really ever before in human history. But this is not due
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:58.700]   to a increasingly free government, this is due to increasingly free technological connectedness,
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:04.940]   increasing technology of transportation, technology of communication, etc. And so on a
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:10.220]   practical basis, any one individual can be more free today than the freest person out there 100
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:18.460]   years ago. But there's two separate trends, so I choose to focus on that. But I get really concerned
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:23.740]   about some of the trends. And right now, I think the United States is one of the best in the world
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:27.660]   for some of the things that matter to me, but that's not to say that it will still be that way
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:33.100]   15 years from now. I think about educational freedom, the freedom to educate your children
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:38.460]   as you desire. I think about medical freedom. We've seen that collapse around the world over
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:44.940]   the last few years. You see laws passed in Canada as horrific with some of the recent laws they've
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:49.820]   passed related to parents and parental rights with their children, etc. And so that could happen in
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:55.180]   the United States as well, and so I was concerned about that. I thought I needed a solution. Those
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:00.300]   were the negative outcomes that I was seeking to avoid by building a Plan B. What about positive
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:05.820]   outcomes? I don't think that negative planning is ideal. There may be times in which it's relevant,
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:12.700]   but I don't think it's ideal. There were some positive outcomes that I wanted from going
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:18.620]   abroad. One was just simply the fun and the adventure, right? I enjoy being able to thrive
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:25.260]   in an increasingly interconnected, international, multicultural lifestyle. I enjoy that very much.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:33.100]   I'm not, you know, it's funny. I think that there are people who have xenophobia, where they
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:46.140]   have a strange and unwarranted fear or hatred or dislike of foreign cultures, foreign persons, etc.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:51.180]   I think there are also people that have unreasonable xenophilia, where they have a
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:59.020]   strange and weird aversion to their own culture, their own like-minded people, the people of their
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:06.460]   race, their ethnicity, their culture, and they have this strange love of foreign cultures. But
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.860]   I find that there's, at least for me, maybe I'm deluding myself, but I think there's a happy
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:17.500]   medium where I enjoy the fun and the variety and the spice of life that comes with international
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:22.140]   living, international exposure. It's fun to be in places that are different and to experience
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:28.220]   some of those things. The other big positive thing, though, was as someone who cares about freedom,
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:35.020]   I want the ability to live freely in an increasingly unfree world for myself. And
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:43.420]   along the way I came across the theory of what is now usually called flag theory,
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:50.860]   was formerly called PT theory, which stands for any number of acronyms, but it could be perpetual
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:57.660]   travel or permanent tourist theory. And as someone who enjoys pretty much being left alone,
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:02.300]   I looked at some of the trends that I outlined over the last hundred years in not only the United
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.980]   States, but many governments around the world, and I realized that if you're somebody who cares
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:11.660]   about personal liberty, it's pretty hard to fight those trends. But you may not need to fight,
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:19.740]   just choose to live freely. Harry Brown's book, How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World,
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:26.220]   is a fantastic book, well appreciated by people like me who appreciate individual liberty.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:32.220]   And yet it was Harry Brown and some of his friends who came up with the more powerful theory of PT
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:38.860]   theory. And so when I started to understand it, I realized that this is the closest that I think
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:45.340]   it's possible to come in our current day and age to maximum levels of personal liberty.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:50.860]   For the uninitiated, let me discuss what the theory is. This was developed back in the 1980s by
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:56.940]   basically a handful of rich international libertarian playboys who were looking around
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.700]   at the world and trying to figure out how do we do what we want to do and live how we want to live.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:08.940]   And what they realized was simply you can, if you leave one place where your actions are not
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:14.300]   appreciated or allowed, and go to a place where your lifestyle is appreciated and allowed,
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:22.300]   you can live how you want to live. So if gambling is illegal where you live,
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:28.700]   and you want to gamble, you can just simply leave where you are and go to a place where
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:34.940]   gambling is allowed and gamble your heart out. This is why in the United States you have this
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.620]   patchwork of laws where certain places you can do certain kinds of gambling. Sometimes you have to
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:42.380]   go to Las Vegas, you have to go to an Indian reservation. It's just a different place where
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.260]   they have different rules, and then you can follow the law. If prostitution is illegal where you live
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.580]   but you want to engage the services of a prostitute, go to a place where prostitution is legal.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:56.620]   If drugs are illegal where you want to live but you want to engage in that activity, go to a place
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:01.900]   where it's legal. Don't run the legal risk of being tossed in prison, just go. And I think about
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:06.940]   this, the old example of prohibition in the United States when the United States outlawed consumption
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:13.980]   of alcohol. There were a handful of Americans who just picked up their bags and went to Europe,
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:18.700]   went somewhere else. Maybe you want to have multiple wives, go to a place where polygamy
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:23.740]   is legal. Maybe you want to run a certain kind of business. You see this right now where there are
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.100]   certain businesses that are simply not acceptable in certain places, you can go to another place
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:31.980]   where they accept that kind of business. And this strategy of "go where you're treated best" as
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:41.580]   Andrew Henderson has trademarked it, is a pretty effective strategy because it doesn't rely upon
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:47.340]   your forcing anyone else to change. It just relies upon you making the individual choice to change
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:53.420]   yourself. And it's one of the most effective things you can do. If you're living in a place
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:59.900]   where they don't have laws that you like, you can spend your life arguing for the changing of those
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:05.180]   laws. And if you feel that that's an effective use of your time, I honor you for that. But you might
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:10.140]   also just spend 20 years of your life and make no impact when you could have just picked up and left
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:15.340]   and gone somewhere else where they have laws that you like. And so this was the basic concept of PT
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:20.380]   theory. Now they took it to another extreme by using internationalization. And originally you
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.300]   had the three flag theory, then you had the five flag theory that was eventually developed. Now
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:29.500]   people are calling it seven and eight flag theory. But the idea is choose each government for what
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:37.180]   each government does best. So the five flags are these. Number one, you want to have a citizenship
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:43.740]   from a country that will give you a good travel document. So you can travel the world, right? If
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:48.780]   you reflect upon the fact that nowhere in the world basically has open borders at this point
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:55.260]   in time, the whole passport regime is a necessity. So you need some kind of passport document in
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.900]   order to travel with. And ideally you would get one that allows you to go the places that you want
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:04.700]   to go with minimal hassle and minimal problems. And so you want to get a citizenship from a country
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.340]   that gives you a good travel document. You also want ideally a country that leaves you alone and
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:15.820]   that doesn't impose undue burdens on you. So you want a country that doesn't tax you on your foreign
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:21.580]   income, income earned abroad. You want a country that doesn't impose military service on you or
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:27.500]   your children. You want a country that doesn't impose onerous reporting requirements and make
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:33.420]   you file a form every year of how much Bitcoin do you own or what kind of money did you earn or did
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:40.140]   you do something somewhere in the world etc. So that's your first flag is your citizenship flag
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:47.100]   and related to citizenship of course your passport flag. The second flag is your residency flag. So
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:52.140]   ideally you would have a place where you have a residence, a personal residence. And in a perfect
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:59.820]   world that residence would be from a country that will leave you alone, that won't give you
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.300]   laws that you disagree with. For me they won't say you can't homeschool your children or they won't
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:11.100]   say you have to inject your babies with an experimental vaccine or things like that.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:17.580]   You want a country that won't tax you. Ideally they won't tax you on your foreign income. They
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:23.420]   pretty much leave you alone. They won't expose you to personal security risks, things like that.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.500]   You want to have the right to live in that country. And ideally it's a place that you want to live.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.340]   And then number three is your business base. And so you want to have your business flag. You
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.980]   want to have your business set up in a stable business jurisdiction that allows you to run
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.380]   your business the way that you want to run it. That gives you all the necessary paperwork so
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:48.220]   that you can stay on the right side of the law with your business and gives you the opportunity
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:55.500]   to run your affairs that are appropriate for your kind of business. And ideally it would be
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.460]   a jurisdiction that doesn't impose heavy taxes on you. They might impose some taxes,
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.740]   but if they do impose taxes, ideally it's a very light taxation, light regulation, just enough to
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:11.980]   have appropriate for your industry, but not heavy taxation and not heavy regulation. And so that's
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.420]   your business flag. Your fourth flag is your asset flag. Where do you do your banking? Where do you
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:24.060]   keep your money? And so ideally here you would have a country that allows you to have a stable
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:29.180]   financial system, gives you high quality banking products, high quality investment products,
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.420]   has good laws that protect you, that protect you from fraud, that protect you from creditors,
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:38.220]   and that basically allows you to keep your money safe so that you don't worry about it.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.580]   And then your fifth flag is traditionally what they call your playgrounds. So these are the
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:46.860]   places that you enjoy spending time, and yet they may not be the places that you would want to live,
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:53.420]   but you spend time in those places as a tourist. And a country will generally treat tourists better
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.380]   than citizens, generally treat tourists very lightly, they won't impose a lot of laws or
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:03.420]   obligations on tourists, pretty much leave tourists alone. And so you choose those places that you'd
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:08.380]   like to be in, maybe they're places that have great shopping or great lifestyle, and you spend
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:14.380]   your time in those places as a tourist. And to this day I still say that for those who want to
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:20.380]   kind of the maximum expression of libertarianism is probably that. It's not the best lifestyle for
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:26.380]   most because it involves a significant degree of international relocation, but if you care about
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.940]   freedom it's probably the best lifestyle. And so I wanted to be prepared to be able to live that
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:37.340]   lifestyle if I chose to. It's much more burdensome to do that with children, and I think there are
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:43.980]   substantial downsides to doing it with children. There's the sense of rootlessness and ungroundedness
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.260]   and lack of home that I think can be pretty significant, but that's the basic concept.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:55.180]   And I wanted to be prepared for that. And if you have that I think it can prepare you
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:00.460]   to be basically free, to be a peaceful and honorable citizen of the world,
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:10.060]   living in a way that you believe is right and effective. So that's the first set of reasons why
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:17.420]   I myself left the United States, is I wanted a plan B. The other factor was simply that it was
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:24.060]   convenient for me to leave the United States when I did. In 2018 my wife and I packed up our children
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.300]   and started traveling around the United States, and we wanted a break. We wanted to do something
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.700]   different. I'd always wanted to travel around the country in an RV and figured why not do it now.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:38.460]   Along the way we were open to the idea of living in other places other than Florida where we're from,
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:47.020]   but we never really found anything that fit us, anything particular that we wanted to do.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:52.140]   And we thought, and so along that way we conceived a child and we needed to have the baby somewhere.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:56.460]   We didn't want to have the baby in an RV. And we'd already gotten rid of our house, gotten rid of
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:03.180]   our furniture, just had some things in storage. And I proposed the idea of birth tourism and she
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:07.100]   said yeah. And basically it was convenient for us to leave the United States. We thought okay,
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:12.700]   let's go and do it. Let's go and do birth tourism. Because birth tourism was a good way of
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:21.420]   solving some of the issues that I was working on. So when we left we didn't have the plan to have a
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:25.100]   plan A and not come back to the United States. It just seemed like a convenient thing. Let's go have
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:29.420]   a baby and then we'll figure out what the next step is. Well the next step happened to be a
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:34.860]   pandemic and we were doing fine. We'd found good infrastructure and we were enjoying traveling and
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:40.220]   enjoying it for a few years. And so we thought let's just keep this up. And then kind of the
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:45.580]   final reason that I left the United States is it keeps my life interesting. I enjoy the challenge
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:51.260]   of change. I've learned about my personality type that I'm not the kind of person that is going to
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:56.700]   do the same thing for 20 years. I'm the personality type that basically a few years, three, four,
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.100]   five years, and I've pretty much, it scratched whatever itch I have at the moment, I'm ready to
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.340]   move on to other things. And so having the idea of living in different places appeals to me.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:15.660]   And I enjoy it. Will I stay gone from the United States? I think probably not.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:20.620]   I think probably not. And let me articulate some of those reasons. I've tried to give you the
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:26.300]   strongest argument in favor basically of leaving at least for plan B by just simply sharing
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.540]   what things I was looking for. But will I stay gone?
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:38.380]   The longer I'm away from the United States, the more sensitive I am to how good things
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:45.740]   are in the United States. I don't believe that any one country is perfect.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:55.260]   And I'm not looking for the perfect country. I think that there's probably on every issue,
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:08:03.100]   there's probably another country that does almost everything better than my own native country of
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:14.620]   the United States. But when you look at the overall set of basically life, the United States
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:20.700]   does indeed offer a very compelling value proposition, especially for those who are
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:27.340]   culturally comfortable in the United States, especially for people who are English speakers,
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:34.140]   especially for people who feel some sense of connection or appreciation of those unique things
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:41.500]   in American culture. On the whole, the U.S. offers a pretty good
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:51.900]   set of features and benefits for many people. I will compare it to my opinions on SUVs.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:09:00.620]   I think that SUVs are pretty mediocre at most things. If you look at virtually any application,
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:08.140]   you can find a vehicle that's a specialty purpose vehicle that's better suited for that application.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:15.260]   If, for example, you want to carry a lot of people, an SUV isn't great. A van is much more
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:22.140]   comfortable. If you want to go fast, an SUV isn't great. A sports car is much faster. If you want to
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:27.260]   be comfortable on the highway, an SUV isn't great. A luxury car will probably give you a better ride
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:32.860]   and a better experience on the highway. If you want a vehicle that can pull a big trailer,
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:38.460]   an SUV isn't great. A pickup truck is better. Basically, the place that an SUV shines is if
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:44.060]   you want a four-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicle to get you and six of your friends
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:50.540]   up to the top of a mountain on a rutted dirt road. In that situation, an SUV does shine.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:54.540]   You can still modify a van to be better. You can still modify a pickup truck to be better,
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:10:00.940]   but an SUV does shine in that situation. On virtually everything else, an SUV is mediocre.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:07.900]   What an SUV does is it gives you the utility of pretty much being able to do all those things.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:13.340]   That's why people like it. It can hold seven people. It's not super comfortable, but when you
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:18.380]   need to hold seven people, you can put seven people in there. It's not great off-road, but it
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.180]   can go down a rutted road better than a car can, but it's still comfortable on the highway. It
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:29.820]   does most things well enough. If you want a do-it-all vehicle, with the exception of gas
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:36.620]   mileage, then it can do it all well enough. Even gas mileage, you can argue, "Eh, it's good enough."
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:42.540]   That's how the United States feels to me right now, is that it's pretty mediocre at many things,
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:50.220]   not everything, and I can find a country on virtually all things that is better than the
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:55.980]   United States. But if I'm putting together the list of benefits of things that are important for
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:04.780]   me, the United States has a pretty good package. While I might not choose it intentionally as an
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:10.780]   immigrant, since I already am an American citizen, since I already have my infrastructure there, etc.,
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:14.540]   since I'm already culturally American, since I already have friends, I understand it, I speak
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:20.540]   the language, etc., it makes a lot of sense. And I think that if you're an American listener,
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:28.780]   you would probably find that it's similar for you. So the United States is probably not the
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:33.740]   freest place in the world, but you do have a lot of freedoms, and at least for me, some of the
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:41.100]   freedoms that I care most about are significant in the United States. I care about freedom of
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:46.780]   speech, I care about freedom of religion, I care about freedom of education, I care about freedom
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:53.580]   of healthcare choices, you know, this kind of stuff. And I can do most of that stuff in the
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:58.700]   United States really well. The United States offers a pretty good lifestyle. It's not the
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:04.540]   cheapest place in the world, places that are cheaper, but it's one of the cheapest places in
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:09.980]   the world when you factor in all of the factors in terms of the lifestyle benefits. It's not the
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:15.340]   most, doesn't have the best cities in the world, but it's got enough good ones, just got good stuff
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:20.540]   all around. And especially on some of the things that make life really livable, and especially on
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:26.460]   some of the things that make life really livable for me as a father with children. When it comes
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:32.460]   to culture, there are a couple of things that are really important. Number one is a sense of
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:39.100]   cultural identity. And I've struggled with this one for many years, because if I live in the United
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:46.140]   States, I can give my children kind of a pretty decent American cultural identity. But I'm not
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:53.500]   myself kind of the flag-waving, like, nationalistic kind of guy. I do appreciate, it stirs my heart
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:13:01.180]   when I go to a Fourth of July parade, but I have struggles with some of the hardcore nationalism.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:06.540]   But I'm also not a destroyer, right? I don't fit in well, and I wouldn't be Howard Zinn's disciple.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:12.620]   And so I'm kind of in the middle, where I appreciate certain things, and I'm skeptical of
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:18.700]   some other things. And so I can give my children a sense of American identity, but I can't really
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:24.700]   ever give them an identity of another country full-heartedly, because I'm still American through
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.340]   and through, right? Country I'm living in says, "Put on a mask," and I go, "Grumble, grumble,
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:33.020]   I'm not gonna wear a stupid face mask. You can't tell me what to do, because I'm American."
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:44.540]   Just a goofy but true example. And so you have this weird third culture that you wind up making.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:49.260]   But more importantly, when you think about opportunities for your children, you think about
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.300]   cultural opportunities. Some of the things that really matter to me are easier to do in the United
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.980]   States than anywhere else in the world. And the stuff that I talk about on the show. Number one,
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.540]   from an educational perspective, educational freedom in the United States is higher than it is
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:09.420]   in most places. And it's easier to access than it is in most places. You can do pretty much anything
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:13.900]   you want to do with your children's education, depending on what state you're in. And that means
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:19.500]   that you can be far ahead of the status quo, and you don't have to fight anybody to do it.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:25.340]   You don't have to sit down and create some random set of documents to prove that you've created an
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:29.340]   umbrella school that allows you to pursue the things that you want to pursue. You can pretty
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:35.500]   much do it. More importantly, there's access available. The United States is a very egalitarian
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:42.940]   society, it's a meritocracy, very strong meritocracy, with a cultural resentment of nepotism,
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:50.300]   which allows individuals to flourish at a very young age. Recently, I was thinking about
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:15:01.420]   Cole... what was his last name? The... Summers, Cole Summers, who wrote the book Don't Tell Me I
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:06.140]   Can't, An Ambitious Homeschooler's Journey. And, you know, here he is, he's 14 years old,
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:11.660]   he tragically died a few months ago. And so this brought a lot of attention to his story. That's
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:17.660]   where I first heard about him. But here he is, this child of handicapped parents, and he's a
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:22.780]   homeschooled, unschooled child, but he winds up owning a multi-hundred acre ranch at 14 years old,
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:28.940]   doing incredible things simply because he had the opportunity. And you can do that in the United
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:34.220]   States, you can't do that in many places. I struggle with helping my children to earn money.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:39.100]   In the United States, I can teach a 10-year-old how to make several hundred dollars per week just
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:45.660]   in his spare time, easily, without any like, not selling, just simple stuff.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:52.540]   Around the world, it's much harder. You have much more significant laws, rules, regulations,
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:58.460]   and that stuff really chafes me. In addition to the United States, you can get the best of the best
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:04.860]   of equipment, right? Any book your child wants to order, wants to read, it's on your doorstep
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.020]   the next day, even if it was printed in 1937 and it's stored on the other side of the world. It's
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:17.020]   just amazing access to information, education. You have access to the best of the best, and easy
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.820]   access to the equipment you want, right? I'm trying to get a 3D printer for my children. In the United
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:26.300]   States, you can figure out what's the very best 3D printer and have it show up two days later.
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:30.860]   In some other parts of the world, it's much harder to access it. And I just go on and on and on,
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:34.860]   but that stuff really matters to me. And so the lifestyle in the United States is really, really
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:41.180]   great. You look at classes, you look at, meaning, you know, hobbies, classes, etc. If you're in a
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:47.340]   reasonably sized metro area, anything you've ever dreamed of is available. There's a parkour gym
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:53.260]   here, there's a BJJ gym there, there's an American Ninja Warrior course on the other side, there's a
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:58.780]   great world-class trainer the next lane over. And of course, you can find specialty stuff if your
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:04.940]   child is a very skilled athlete, but you can find all of it within the country. Best coaches in the
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:09.820]   world, the best instruction, the best equipment, it's all right at your fingertips. This incredible
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:14.860]   convenience that makes the life of a parent, especially a motivated, engaged parent, really,
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:20.700]   really easy. In terms of recreation, virtually any hobby that you want to do, virtually any
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:25.100]   thing that you want to do, there's a whole community around it. And there's that community
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:31.820]   is the best in the world, and all the stuff is available. And on a global basis, it's just not
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:38.140]   consistent. There are countries that have great opportunities, but even in the most, in the
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:45.020]   countries that have incredible consumer conveniences for my lifestyle,
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:51.020]   they're often not the consumer conveniences that I care the most about. And so you have certain
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:57.580]   cities and countries of the world that have better city style consumer conveniences in the United
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:04.700]   States, but I'm not a big city guy. Like, that's not how I want to live. I enjoy more diverse
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:12.700]   hobbies, etc. And then in terms of my kind of people, right, when you really care about
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.980]   in the United States, when it comes to all the freedom stuff that I said, Americans get it,
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:24.540]   generally speaking. Even if they don't agree, they get it. And there's a much higher percentage
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:30.620]   of people that feel like how I feel than what I find going around the world. And so for me,
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:37.420]   culturally, the United States is very, very comfortable. And I think this is the case for
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:46.140]   many in my listening audience. I think that if you make a list of the things that you want from
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:51.980]   the potential of another country, most of those things are likely met better by simply another
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:19:00.540]   region, another state or another city within the United States. People underestimate how difficult
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:08.460]   it is to successfully expatriate to another place. I have done this multiple times. I saw a course on
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   it, I'll advertise the course at the end, but I have a fully established infrastructure for multiple
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:23.260]   countries with legal rights of residence, legal with bank accounts, cell phones, work rights,
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:31.260]   everything set up. So I've done it multiple times, more than two. And it is so much work
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:39.740]   to set that stuff up. And even having all the legal rights doesn't satisfy knowing the culture,
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.180]   knowing the level of personal expression in the culture, understanding all the cues,
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:50.220]   facing the racial discrimination that you face for being a foreigner, not having all of the
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:54.940]   proper level of reserve or the proper level of openness and having all of that stuff.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:20:01.660]   I enjoy the international... I like those challenges. I like the challenge of figuring out
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:08.540]   how to be culturally couth in a foreign language and in a foreign culture. I enjoy that. It's fun,
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:15.420]   but it's hard. And I think most people it's much harder than you should want to do.
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:25.260]   I need also to simply talk about the future and tell you this. Let me introduce this topic
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:33.660]   with a letter from a listener. "Hey Joshua, I'd like to enroll in your Bitcoin privacy course."
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.420]   "One of the most impactful podcasts I've listened to was your show on why a parent should stay home
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:43.100]   when children are young, and that it makes more sense to invest time with children above putting
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:47.260]   money into a college savings account. After listening to that podcast episode twice and
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.700]   giving it quite a bit of thought, I decided I should stay at home with my children while they're
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:56.060]   very young." I'm thinking zero to four years old makes sense. "I gave up a very high paying job.
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.140]   I could have retired very comfortably with five to 10 more years of work and completely reoriented
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:05.500]   myself to a different kind of life I didn't even consider prior to listening to that episode. I
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.780]   appreciate the holistic approach you take towards financial planning and keeping an eye on the
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:14.460]   extreme events that occur throughout history and will probably occur in our lifetimes. One piece
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:20.300]   of unsolicited constructive criticism, as someone who has studied geopolitics and traveled extensively,
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:25.500]   I think you underestimate the role the USA plays in global security and the extent to which we
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.380]   actually have it much better here in the US. After listening to your recent post-COVID shows,
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:34.940]   I think you're coming around on the latter point, but probably still don't quite appreciate the
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:39.900]   former. As a large country with perfectly defensible borders, an ability to feed itself
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:45.260]   many times over, a river system that enables essentially free transport of goods, and an
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.980]   ability to generate enough energy to provide for our population, the United States dominates the
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:56.300]   world and, in my opinion, is the only reason we haven't ended in nuclear annihilation. If the
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.580]   United States were to fall or break apart in the age of nuclear weapons and bioweapons, there
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.300]   wouldn't be a geopolitical player strong enough to enforce world order and conflicts would once
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:12.380]   again flare up. Indeed, since the USA is weaker on a relative basis and more importantly just not
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:19.100]   interested in enforcing world order, conflicts are beginning to rage and famine is once again
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:24.140]   looming. I mention this because the idea of "getting out of the country" for US citizens is
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:29.500]   a false hope. If the USA were devastated, and somehow there were other areas of the world that
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:35.100]   weren't, world order would slip and it's difficult to think of places safer than certain parts of
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:40.300]   North America. Certainly places like South and Central America would experience conflict without
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:46.060]   the USA imposing order from above. This might be a borderline offensive thing to read, but
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:51.180]   unfortunately it's true. It's likely that peace isn't the norm anywhere, even in South and Central
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:55.420]   America. If you're interested in understanding this, I'd suggest the works and Twitter page of
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:01.740]   Peter Zaihan. His first book, The Accidental Superpower (2014) lays out this case in detail.
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:06.060]   His latest book, Disunited Nations, is prescient in its predictions, including Russia being
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:12.540]   extremely aggressive as its demography deteriorates. Though I 100% believe all of the above, you never
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:17.980]   know. So I want to own some Bitcoin anonymously. Looking forward to the course. So that listener
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:25.020]   of mine I think makes some very important and cogent points. And I want to say very clearly that
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:33.820]   on economic issues and security issues, etc., once again, my appreciation of the United States has
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.460]   grown over the last few years. And I don't know if I could have experienced this without going
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:45.180]   abroad. When you're raised or when you live in the cultural milieu of the United States,
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:52.620]   it's very easy to assume that things are better elsewhere. And because all you see is the problems
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:57.580]   of your own scenario. In some ways it's kind of like a relationship, right? If you're in a
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:05.260]   relationship and you see all the problems with your wife, like here's a long list of problems,
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:10.300]   and you assume because you only see other people at their best that other people don't have those
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:16.940]   same problems. But a little bit of maturity would say that while it may be true that this particular
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:23.660]   wife that I have has her own unique set of problems, in general other people probably
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:28.780]   aren't as good as I might think. We all have our problems. In the United States it's easy to look
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:33.740]   around and say, well, the US dollar is going to disappear. But the only frame of reference you
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:40.300]   have is the US dollar in many cases. And over my last three and a half years of living abroad,
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:45.580]   I've come to appreciate so many things about the United States. I appreciate deeply the banking
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:52.620]   system. The United States does not have the world's best banks, as measured by security,
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:58.220]   reserves, etc. But in many ways the United States has some of the world's best banks.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:04.860]   And for non-Americans, my first banking haven for them that I recommend is the United States.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:11.740]   The US banking infrastructure, the global nature of it, the credit card industry, the banking
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:20.700]   products, the low costs, the zero tax on banking profits for non-American persons, is really,
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:26.220]   really incredible. And while there are many good banks around the world, and I believe that
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.820]   all thoughtful Americans should have bank accounts in other countries, the US banking
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:38.780]   structure is really phenomenal. I continue to use the US banking system as my primary banking
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:44.300]   system because of its many benefits. One of the great benefits that Americans who go abroad have
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:49.180]   is that the United States has very different tax residency rules than any other country in the
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:56.700]   world. Because the United States assumes that your tax residency or their right to tax you is based
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:03.340]   on citizenship rather than on residency, the line of whether you're subject to American taxes or not
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:10.060]   is very, very clear. You are. If you're an American citizen or a US person, you are. You're subject to
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:18.060]   taxation. And the line of whether or not you can experience some tax exclusion for being abroad is
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.060]   very, very clear. You either qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion or you don't.
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:27.020]   And it's based upon your person, not based on anything else. This is different than the
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:32.780]   nation, the citizens of other countries. So for example, if I were a Canadian and I wanted to
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:40.780]   become tax non-resident Canada, becoming legally tax non-resident Canada is much more invasive to
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:48.460]   my lifestyle than simply going abroad. If I want to truly be tax non-resident in Canada, I would be
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:54.380]   very well advised to eliminate ownership of all physical property in Canada, not only real estate,
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:27:00.300]   but even things in a storage unit and physical items. I would need to end banking relationships,
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:05.740]   close out bank accounts, basically sever all ties with Canada and make it very clear that I don't
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:10.380]   live in Canada and I'm not coming back. And basically the only thing that I can keep is my
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:15.900]   passport if I want to truly be safe about tax non-residency. Now the benefit is that Canadian
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:22.220]   can keep his citizenship and go abroad and not have any tax obligation to the Canadian government.
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.900]   That's an opportunity. That's a benefit that Americans don't have. But the benefits for
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:31.500]   Americans are simply that if you go abroad, you can get the foreign earned income exclusion.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.780]   And for an American, you can still keep everything in the United States. You can keep your house,
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:40.060]   you can keep your car, you can keep your bank accounts, you can keep your credit cards,
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:44.300]   you can keep all that stuff. And in fact, even if you weren't a citizen, you can pretty much
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:49.580]   keep all that stuff as well. So having all the infrastructure in the United States is really,
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:55.100]   really powerful. And so when I go around the world and I look at banking products and I live as an
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:01.180]   international citizen, I'm very grateful to have the US banking infrastructure and system as my
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:06.460]   primary scenario. My MX works in any country in the world basically. And that's a really powerful
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:11.580]   opportunity. Great exchange rates, no foreign transaction fees, everything is just simple,
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:17.660]   easy. It all works really well. The US dollar. It's one thing to say, what are we going to do
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.180]   when the US dollar loses its reserve, its status as a reserve currency in the world?
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:28.620]   That's a very fair question. But what's going to replace it today? This is why the US dollar
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:35.020]   continues to maintain its power. What's going to replace it today? There are many good currencies
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:38.540]   around the world. I believe in currency diversification. I think there are other
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:45.820]   currencies that are excellent. I go over some of those in my course. But the US dollar is still
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:52.860]   the safe haven of choice. And as someone who now looks at the world differently, I look at the US
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:29:00.380]   dollar as a safe haven. Because it's better than many other local scenarios. What about economic
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:06.060]   affairs? Could the United States collapse? Well, let's do investing first. When you look at
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:11.820]   investing on a global basis, I believe that there are many good pockets of the world where you could
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:17.420]   get high returns in investments. My dream job when I was in college, I wanted to be an international
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:22.620]   correspondent for a mutual fund company and be like the man in the field, knocking on doors of
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:26.300]   companies and writing reports and work for a mutual fund that did international investing.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.860]   Never did it, but that was what one of my dream jobs was. Today, I think there's still those
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.300]   opportunities there. You can find countries that have exciting growth opportunities. You can find
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.380]   investments in those countries that have good growth opportunities, etc. But when you look at
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:49.180]   the power and the stability of the US markets, US stock market, huge, greatest companies of the
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:58.940]   world listed on that market. Incredibly transparent, well-regulated market, incredibly researched,
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:06.460]   extraordinarily efficient. And those countries reflecting the global exposure that you get from
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:11.740]   those companies. I misspoke, I meant to say companies. The level of global diversification
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.660]   that you get from investing in these large companies listed on American stock exchanges
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:22.620]   is incredible. The shockingly low cost of investment, the low fees, the great customer
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:29.820]   service, though it's just a wonderful market to invest in. And so while there may be pockets that
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:38.540]   may outperform temporarily the US stock market, today I have a very hard time believing that
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:49.020]   there's any better market given the totality of the factors. And I think that while 100% exposure
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:55.820]   to the US stock market is probably not right for people who have international exposure.
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:31:04.140]   Meaning if I were, let's say that I'm living in, you know, Uruguay, would I put 100% of my money
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:09.900]   in the stock market? No. But I would not do that for the same reason I don't want 100% of my money
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:14.700]   in anything. But do I want the bulk of my money in the US stock market? I would sleep very well
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:21.180]   at night having the bulk of my money in the US stock market. It just makes sense. It's just
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:25.740]   remarkable and powerful. And I don't want to understate that because it's very easy to go on
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.420]   and on and say, well, Cambodia has the best place in the world and the best opportunities in the
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:35.100]   world. Maybe. But it's very hard for me to be confident, not being Cambodian, not speaking the
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:40.300]   language, not having all of those resources. Very, very hard for me to feel confident in that.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:47.900]   And the safety there is a big factor. You can interpret how I mean safety, I don't need to
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:58.460]   clarify. It's a very different scale. Now, what about personal security? The United States is not
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:04.220]   the safest country in the world. Certainly not. But interestingly, when you look at the totality
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:09.180]   of factors for personal safety and personal security, as long as you don't live in one of
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:14.220]   the inner city of one of the big democrat cities in the United States where there are major
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:19.180]   increasing levels of crime, the level of safety that you get in the United States is very, very
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:26.300]   high. And the level of safety that you get at a very low cost is very, very high. There are many
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:32.060]   places in the world that have much better crime statistics than the United States. One of the
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:37.260]   safest places in the world is Dubai. There are many parts of Europe that are very safe, Eastern
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:43.740]   Europe, etc. And you can live in those places very safely. You can live safely in many places
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:48.940]   of the world. But when you look at the low cost, the relatively low cost of a safe lifestyle in
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:57.500]   the United States for physical safety, it's much lower than many places. It's much cheaper for you
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:06.060]   to live in the United States than it is for you to live in Berlin, in pockets of the United States.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:11.020]   Of course, I'm very conscious of the idea that I'm painting with a very broad brush here.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:15.180]   But I'm trying to make the point that when you consider the total lifestyle benefits and personal
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:22.140]   safety, the United States is exceedingly safe. In addition, what about long-term future?
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:28.140]   This listener of mine talked about the future of the United States.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:37.100]   And I think that his comments are accurate. He mentioned analyst Peter Zeihan. I recently
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:40.460]   mentioned I've been reading Peter Zeihan's newest book called "The End of the World as We Know It
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:48.380]   is Just the Beginning". And that book makes a powerful, powerful case for how the United States
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:57.020]   and the United States alone is positioned to flourish in the coming decades.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:02.860]   And while I hope that Zeihan is wrong in some of his most pessimistic predictions,
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:09.980]   and I think there may be factors that he hasn't considered that could upset his analysis and
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:14.940]   predictions, his arguments for the power of the United States are really, really strong.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:20.780]   And I think I'll save some of those to cover in a separate episode. But it's remarkable when you
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:27.580]   look at how unique, unique among virtually any other country, the United States has it all.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:33.900]   The United States has it all with regard to energy independence, food independence. The
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:38.700]   United States has it all with regard to robust manufacturing and robust consumption.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:49.740]   Natural resources and manufacturing ability, kind of finishing products as well. The United States
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:55.820]   has a huge and powerful country that has a big enough population to actually use it effectively.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:00.940]   The United States has, I think the United States is the fourth largest landmass in the world,
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:07.660]   largest is Russia. I think Canada next, then China, then the US. But what problems do those
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:14.780]   countries have? Russia has a huge physical geography, it's a huge country, but they have
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:20.300]   two problems. Most of the country is unusable and unlivable, and they have a small population
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:28.460]   massively declining. Canada, huge country, but a lot of the population, a lot of the geography is
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:33.660]   unlivable because it's so northerly, so cold, and they have a tiny population and declining,
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:40.780]   except for immigration. China, huge country, huge population, but facing utter population collapse
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:49.020]   due to the effect of their one-child policy, and also massive political problems with the cult of
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:56.540]   the leader of China. Whereas the United States has a huge country and all kinds of physical
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:05.580]   advantages, well-protected oceans, protecting it from invasion from abroad, a huge northern neighbor
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:12.460]   with a strong ally and unhabitable area to the north of that, and the ally is small and friendly
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:17.420]   to the southern border, is largely defensible because giant desert, very hard to invade,
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:24.380]   and a pretty increasingly okay relationship with a southern neighbor and a good symbiosis. So good
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:28.300]   physical security, you got again cheap transportation, the river network, etc.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:39.100]   And the US population is large, large, dynamic, and not collapsing as precipitously as the
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:43.900]   populations of many countries in the world. The demographics in the United States are not great,
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:50.700]   but they're not horrific, they're better than many other places. And so going forward, these are very
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:59.740]   good reasons to believe that the US has a very strong and powerful future. So when you're looking
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:04.460]   for areas of the world, and then I mentioned famine, right? I'm very concerned about famine
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:09.580]   right now, very concerned. Week by week goes in, the news doesn't get better. I keep hoping it's
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:14.140]   going to get better, the news does not get better on the global food situation, the global food
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:23.260]   supply. It just seems at this point, put it this way, if we avoid, I don't want to say the number
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:28.060]   of hundreds of millions, but if we avoid tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people dying
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:32.860]   in the next couple of years due to global famine, I don't know how, I don't see the solution at the
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:39.340]   moment. And that's going to lead to tremendous unrest, tremendous problems on a global basis.
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:45.900]   But the United States and North America are best positioned to be protected from those things.
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:51.180]   So all that to say that while I currently live outside the United States, I'm still working on
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:55.740]   some immigration programs, I'm still enjoying my lifestyle, living well with my family, I've got a
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:03.100]   great living situation, etc. I keep my American passport secure, and I keep all the infrastructure
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:11.820]   set up, and I keep an eye on the news. And if things got bad, then my plan B, my bug out plan,
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:17.980]   is to go back to the United States. Because I think that these are compelling reasons to
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:26.220]   appreciate the potential for the future of the country. And I think that in terms of actionable
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:41.580]   advice, I think the United States as an immigration destination makes a huge amount of sense for many
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:47.900]   people in the world. I'm not sure that it makes the most sense for the highly educated or the very
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:53.500]   financially sophisticated and very wealthy of the world. If I were very wealthy, had a big business
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:58.540]   already, I would not choose to go to the United States. But that's largely because the tax and
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:04.700]   regulation burden is really entangling at that level. If you're looking to get ahead, I don't
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:08.940]   know of a place that's easier to get wealthy than in the United States. I haven't found it yet.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:15.100]   But if you are already wealthy, I wouldn't pursue the United States for that reason. But I would
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:21.820]   definitely have bases there. I would definitely have a visa there. I would definitely have a
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:28.620]   second spot there. I believe that it's just too important in the global affairs of the moment to
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:39.100]   speak lightly of it. I hope that I've done an accurate job in this episode. It was clearly a
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:50.140]   lengthy episode. But I'm trying to articulate in a way that is accurate the way I see these factors.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:57.820]   Meaning, if I were creating a five-minute YouTube video, it would be easy to make a trite statement
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:01.740]   say, "US is the best country in the world" or "US is the worst country in the world."
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:09.580]   I don't believe that's accurate. And I think it's irresponsible to paint with such a broad brush and
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:18.300]   stereotype so significantly. It's important to have texture and nuance to these discussions and
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:24.620]   to these conversations. And I hope that I provided some texture and some nuance so that you could then
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:30.300]   factor this into your own life and to your own lifestyle. If you're an American thinking of
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:35.420]   going abroad and you have a culture that you think is better fit for you, for example,
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:43.740]   one of the biggest reasons that Americans leave the United States and go abroad is because they're
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:49.100]   looking for a progressive culture with features like national health care services, things like
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:56.220]   that. If you're looking for that, I think that's a good reason to go abroad. I've known loads of
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:00.620]   Americans who've moved to other cultures that reflected their values and they've loved their
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:07.340]   lifestyle. They moved to downtown Amsterdam and they can enjoy pedaling the streets of Amsterdam
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:13.100]   on their bicycle and enjoying all of the lifestyle that comes with the European welfare state model.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:18.380]   They don't mind the high taxes because they feel like they're getting good benefits from that. I do
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:22.860]   think, by the way, this is going to be an increasing issue of political instability in the United
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:28.460]   States. The United States taxes can be high, not in all cases, but they're high enough and yet people
[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:32.300]   feel like they're getting ripped off. The health care situation and the health care cost is a major
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:37.420]   issue in the United States right now. And I don't know how it'll be resolved, but I do think it's
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:43.740]   inevitable it'll be resolved in the next decade or so. But I think that you can thrive in that
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:48.940]   situation. You may love moving to Canada and enjoying the Canadian experience or something
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:54.780]   else and there are ways to do that. But if you generally feel culturally American and you've got
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:42:00.380]   a pretty good thing in the United States, I think before you go through the difficulty of fully
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:06.700]   expatriating and doing that as a plan A, your better, easier move is just to relocate inside
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:12.060]   of the United States. Because virtually anything that you're looking for by nature of simply the
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:17.100]   geography of the country and the demographics, virtually anything that you're looking for,
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:23.660]   you can have inside of the United States. Even on the health care perspective, right, you can move
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:29.020]   to Massachusetts, you can move to California, you can move to Oregon, you can move to a place that
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:35.020]   reflects your progressive liberal values. If you're a conservative and you're looking for more freedom,
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:39.500]   you can pick up and you can move to a place that reflects that. You can move to Florida,
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:45.740]   to Idaho, to Texas, to South Dakota, to some place that reflects that. And that transition
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:52.540]   will be vastly easier and much more comfortable for you than moving to Ecuador or moving to...
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:58.940]   I'm not sure what examples to insert.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:10.700]   Be careful when you think of just simply saying that it's all bad in the United States
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:15.340]   and I'm going to go abroad. If I had to sum up my experience over the last few years,
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:22.300]   I am now much more relaxed and much more sanguine about all the events. I didn't
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:25.500]   even talk about politics. I guess I'll take a moment to talk about it.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:33.420]   One of the things that I most appreciate about my time abroad is I think that I've finally severed
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:38.780]   the emotional ties that I've had to politics my whole life. I was a political junkie from the
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:44.380]   time I was a young boy. My grandfather subscribed to US News and World Report and that was what got
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:48.140]   me interested in politics. I would read it every week. I just thought it was so interesting.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:53.180]   And then I used to listen to NPR every day, every single day on the way to school and on the way
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:57.900]   home. Probably one of the very few high schoolers that would come in morning edition on the way to
[01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:02.220]   school and all things considered on the way home by myself in the car listening to NPR.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:07.740]   Did that for years. And so I was super into politics. I listened to Rush Limbaugh when I
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:12.220]   was in high school and got super into politics. And I always cared a lot about politics.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:16.460]   But along the way I woke up and I said, "Well, I believe politics matters. I don't think that
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:20.620]   politics is an effective thing of my life. This is just making me... it makes people unhappy."
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:27.820]   And maybe because I was such a junkie at an early age, I became very sensitive to how destructive
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:32.620]   excessive political involvement is. But I didn't understand how people could sever their psychological
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:37.260]   connection to politics. I thought, "This stuff matters. This stuff is worth arguing about. And
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:43.820]   I believe it matters. I believe it's worth arguing about." But I was excessively devoted to it.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:49.740]   And along the way I came to the point where I said, "I think it matters, but I can't let it
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:54.940]   control my life because my life doesn't change much depending on who's in president. My life is
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:00.780]   pretty much the same under all the presidents and no matter what. It doesn't change much. So I can't
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:06.540]   let this control my life." But I still struggled with being addicted to the junkie side of it,
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:11.660]   arguing about it and telling people on the internet that they're wrong. And I moved abroad.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:18.540]   And I started... I said, "Let me get into politics in wherever I happen to be." I said, "Go find the
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:24.060]   talk radio station and use it to get involved. What are the local issues?" And you leave your
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:28.780]   home country and you go to a completely different place and you listen to different language
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:32.700]   sometimes and you listen to different arguments and you think, "This is a waste of time. What are
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:37.980]   you guys arguing about this stuff over?" And over the years I just got to the point where I don't
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:44.220]   care. I don't care about your local politics. And of course also here you have the great joy of being
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:49.500]   an expat where you just don't have to care much about it. You have this sense of freedom, right?
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:53.580]   That's what you get with PT theory is you don't need to worry too much about what any one government
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:58.140]   does because you're not beholden to the government. And it gave me this intense sense of freedom.
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:01.980]   Then going back to the United States, I still have my political opinions and whatnot, but I just am
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:08.460]   not going to bother arguing about them at this point in time. It's not profitable use of my time.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:15.740]   And it helped me to feel free. And so if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:20.620]   thing that I've done over the last few years. It has been much more disruptive, much more expensive,
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:25.580]   much more difficult than I ever thought it was going to be to set up all the plan B's. Today I
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:32.700]   could do it faster, easier, cheaper, but it was a painful learning experience. But having the plan
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:37.660]   B is really, really awesome. Knowing that I'm not beholden to any one country, knowing that my
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:42.700]   children aren't beholden to any one country is really awesome. But now I can appreciate much
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:51.180]   more the things that are really wonderful about the United States. And I don't want to pat myself
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.940]   on the back too much, but I think that's the healthy perspective. Appreciate the things about
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:47:01.260]   the country that you are in. Taking action can help you to feel better and then appreciating
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:06.780]   things about the country that you're in is I think the right scenario. So I hope that this
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:12.940]   in-depth nuanced discussion gives you what you need. I think that if you are inclined in the
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:18.940]   direction, set up a plan B. I don't think you'll regret that. If you are frustrated with where you
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:23.980]   live, I think look for a better place. And in some cases that better place will be outside the country,
[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:27.420]   but in most cases I think the better place is probably just going to be a different city,
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:33.100]   different town, different state, different region than where you are right now. Because the United
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:39.020]   States has so much going for it that it's a probably 20% of the people who want to leave
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:44.140]   that probably should leave and 80% who should stay. And I hope this helps you to understand
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:50.700]   some of the benefits and some of the reasons why. I do conveniently enough have more help for you. If
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:58.460]   you are a person who still wants to have a plan B or even to have a plan A, I do have a course that
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:05.340]   I wrote that is available for you and you can get that at www.internationalskateplan.com. You've heard
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:11.100]   me discuss in detail my philosophy, what I've done. What you haven't heard me do is give any discussion
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:20.220]   of the details of practical details in this show. And I wanted to create a product that would help
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.380]   you with the practical details of knowing what to do and how to do it. And that product is
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:30.460]   www.internationalskateplan.com. If you buy that course, I will walk you through a four-phase
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:36.060]   approach to leaving your country. And I am agnostic about which country in the course.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:43.340]   Of course, I'm an American so I talk some about that, but it can be any country. And I go through
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:47.820]   the different phases. Everything from just planning to be a tourist where, "Hey, I gotta leave because
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:51.420]   there's some inflation crisis going on or hyperinflation or something bad and I'm just
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:55.740]   gonna go be a tourist with a passport living on tourist visas," all the way through to being a
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:01.100]   complete expat. And I do it in a phased approach, extremely sensible. And I talk you through the
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:05.180]   good money and the bad because there are some things that you can do that are really inexpensive
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:08.940]   and there's some things that you can do that are expensive. And I give you good sound advice in that
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:13.500]   course on how to think about the cost of what's right for you, what's not right for you, etc.
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:18.380]   And in my opinion, it's probably the most level-headed, honest discussion of these issues
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:23.340]   that you will find. So if you're interested in practical advice on how to do it, go to
