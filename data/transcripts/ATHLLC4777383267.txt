[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.400]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.880]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here for a conversation with Liz
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.280]   Moody.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   Liz is a longtime writer, editor, and healthy recipe developer.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.320]   She's the author of two cookbooks, Healthier Together and Glow Pops.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.720]   She was formerly the food director for MindBodyGreen, and she's had her work
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.280]   featured in Vogue, Women's Health, and many more places.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.080]   And last, but certainly not least, she's the host of the hit wellness
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.320]   podcast, Healthier Together, which features intimate interviews with some
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.400]   of the biggest names in the wellness world, as well as a few non-wellness
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.120]   guests like yours truly.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   In fact, the episode I did on her show just went live today as well.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.200]   And in case you aren't watching on YouTube, we recorded both those episodes
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.000]   live from the All The Hacks studio, aka my basement.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.560]   This conversation is going to be chocked full of all kinds of health and wellness
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.640]   hacks, but if you hear that and think it might be too healthy for you, then you
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.920]   should definitely stick around because I happen to know we both share a fondness
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.400]   for a certain unhealthy cereal, and that while Liz certainly believes in the power
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.520]   of food to heal and nourish your body, she also knows that a good pasta
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.720]   carbonara has a place on the table because sometimes it can just heal your
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.360]   soul.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.280]   We're here to talk spices, cold showers, circadian walks, meditation, vitamins,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.160]   taping your mouth at night, hacks to make frozen veggies taste great, and a lot
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.560]   more.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.280]   That is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.440]   Liz, thanks for being here.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.280]   Thanks for having me in your house.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.120]   This feels very like intimate and fun.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   I know I have done almost all virtual recordings online and then two this week
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.640]   in person.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.000]   It feels like the new normal.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.520]   Oh, I'm so happy with it.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.880]   So I'm going to start by letting you know that I too love Fruity Pebbles.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.240]   That is not where I thought you would start.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.880]   Is it your cereal of choice?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.160]   I wouldn't go as far as cereal of choice, but it's definitely in like the top two
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.840]   or three.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   I only say not of choice because like it's not a healthy cereal.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   It's not a natural cereal.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.520]   I thought the colors were like, they always say eat the rainbow.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.240]   Is that not?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.160]   No, that's Skittles.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.360]   Also not natural.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.960]   But people are not going to listen to any of my health advice from this moment.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   Well, actually, I think the opposite, because so often I feel like you're
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   talking to people who have an opinion about health and ways to eat healthier
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.560]   and live healthier and be healthier.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.360]   And you get all of this feedback that is like you can't do anything fun.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.440]   And so I wanted to start with that because when I was reading part of your
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.000]   cookbook and I was just reading some of the content you wrote, I listened to
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.680]   some of your podcasts.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.160]   There is a lot of advice on how you can live and happier, healthier life.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.560]   Yes.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   But I also heard that you love Fruity Pebbles, which makes me feel like you're
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.320]   a normal person and you're not someone who's just like figured out how to never
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.680]   eat anything unhealthy, which I just is not an option in my world.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.440]   I like cinnamon rolls.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.200]   I like donuts.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.160]   I like Fruity Pebbles.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.880]   Do I want to eat them in moderation?
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.640]   Do I want to use hacks to make it better?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.520]   Yes, but I want to at least set the ground with talking about food first, that
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.880]   you are not this rare person that just doesn't like sweet food and that's how
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.360]   you're healthy.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.520]   No, I absolutely love sweet food.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.280]   So I always say that wellness is a tool, not an end unto itself.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.440]   So the second that wellness makes your life worse, it's no longer wellness.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.240]   And I think a lot of people are like, Oh, I'm like living this really healthy
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.520]   life, but they're miserable all of the time with all of the things that they're
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.360]   doing to be quote unquote healthy and healthy includes how we feel in our body.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.040]   But also how we feel in our brain.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.560]   So if you're like, I can't go out to dinner with my friends, cause what am I
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.040]   going to eat?
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.760]   I can't ever eat these like foods that really make me smile and bring me joy.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.360]   That's not wellness.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.200]   Wellness is actually getting in the way of you living your best life.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.880]   So I always like people to zoom out and have that perspective with wellness and
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.960]   with any of the health tools that I provide my audience with.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.720]   I'm like, sometimes I'll say, Oh, here's my night Tim routine.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.680]   And people be like, well, what if I am out late drinking with my friends or I'm at a
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.000]   work party and I can't do it.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.840]   And I'm like, then don't do it.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.160]   If you can't do it, don't do it.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.560]   It's also all designed to help us get optimal sleep.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.880]   So if you're super tired and you're just going to fall asleep anyways, good, fall
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.320]   asleep.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.560]   That's amazing.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.080]   On top of that, I think there are also a lot of things that you can do to make the
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.160]   things that feel a little bit more fun, a little bit more indulgent, not feel as
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   negative on your body.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.480]   So let's take sugar.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.240]   For example, when I was writing my cookbook, I drove my editor crazy with this.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.600]   Cause I was like, for everything, I wanted to have like my very specific perspective
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.880]   and why I was making the assertion that thing was healthy.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.560]   And for dessert, I was like, what is quote unquote unhealthy about dessert?
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.920]   And the main thing is, is that it spikes your blood sugar.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.200]   So you're having a lot of sugar, your blood sugar goes up and then it'll crash down.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.720]   You'll feel lethargic.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   We've all had that sort of like tired, sometimes you get like a little shaky.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.920]   You just don't feel good when your blood sugar rises and then crashes.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.200]   So that's the problem.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.600]   What can we do to solve that?
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.880]   There's a few things we can do.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.640]   One, you can change the format of the dessert itself.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.080]   So I do that by adding fat fiber protein to my desserts.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.120]   I'll put in something like Greek yogurt or almond butter or almond flour and just
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.240]   make it a more stable blood sugar experience from the get go.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.560]   But then there's also other fun things you can do too.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.160]   So I had a woman who calls herself the glucose goddess on my podcast.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.600]   She is amazing.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.920]   She's a biochemist who kind of hacks glucose in her body.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.680]   She wears a continuous glucose monitor and she, her whole thing is studying the
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.520]   different effects that things have on your glucose.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.040]   So she has a few different like little tricks that she recommends that I really
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.400]   like. One is if you want to eat a sweet thing like fruity pebbles.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.840]   We all love our fruity pebbles.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.400]   And I honestly think fruity pebbles like got me through the pandemic.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   I'm like, not sure I was in New York for the early parts of it.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.200]   And I am like, if I didn't have my fruity pebbles, would I be okay right now
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.440]   mentally? And I don't think so.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.920]   But if you want something like your fruity pebbles, don't have it as a snack, have
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.400]   it as an actual dessert, which means after you've consumed some other type of form
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   of food. So after you've had a main course with your protein, with your fat, your
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.800]   fiber, all of that.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.120]   So if you're craving a cookie in the middle of the day, if you're craving your fruity
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.320]   pebbles, be like, that's not off limits to me.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   I'm still going to have it, but I'm going to move it to after a meal.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.480]   That's a really great hack that'll just elongate your blood sugar curve and make
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.160]   sure that your glucose doesn't spike and crash again, eliminating all of those
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.800]   quote unquote negative effects in your body of eating a lot of sugar.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.120]   Another one that I really like is her green starter hack, which is just eat
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.400]   something green before you eat anything else.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.000]   So if you eat something with a lot of fiber, it creates almost like a little stopper
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.720]   in your intestines and it just slows the absorption of everything else in your body.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.200]   So literally you can do this for anything that you eat.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.320]   Just eat a little green salad before some vegetables.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.920]   If you're out at a restaurant before you go for the bread, which is a lot of carbs,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.000]   a lot of stuff that would spike your blood sugar, have a little vegetable side first,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.080]   have a little salad first.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.000]   You can do that with literally anything.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.480]   And that brings me to my last point, which is that I think if we think of wellness
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.360]   as deprivation based, it's not going to stick again.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.040]   It feels like it's making our life worse.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.920]   So with every single part of health, I like to think about what I can add to my
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.560]   life instead of what I can take away.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.120]   So instead of being like, I'm not going to eat any sugar and that's going to make
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.520]   me feel so much better, you think about, I'm going to add a vegetable to every
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.680]   single meal and I'm not going to take anything away.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.960]   And I think if we start to think about what can we add to our lives, we start to
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.240]   feel nourished, we start to feel taken care of, and we start to feel like these
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.600]   things are making our life better instead of being dogmatic and taking away from
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.920]   our experience on this planet.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.000]   So is that as simple as I want to order pizza tonight, but I'm just going to like
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.160]   whip up some broccoli and eat that alongside?
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.920]   A hundred percent.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.840]   So my husband and I eat frozen pizza like quite often for dinner and we'll just
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.880]   make a little salad that we'll eat.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.320]   So we'll get like one of those containers of pre-washed greens.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.920]   We'll put some olive oil.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.880]   I like to like microplane a little bit of garlic, a little bit of a lemon zest, and
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.760]   then squeeze the lemon juice and some salt.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   And we'll eat that first.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.680]   So the thing is you eat the green thing first, or we keep frozen broccoli on hand.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.560]   I love roasting frozen vegetables.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.160]   Have you ever tried that?
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.000]   No, but I know from looking you up, it's like you said roasting frozen vegetables.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.880]   And I was like, gosh, most people you talk to that have written a cookbook are
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.360]   like, the only vegetable you should eat is like fresh from the farmer's market.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.040]   No, no, no.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.880]   I mean, I love the farmer's market.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.480]   It's like very much my happy place.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.600]   And I think it's a wonderful way to get excited about food.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.560]   It feels like a very visceral experience.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.440]   You can walk around and like sample things and it feels beautiful.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.680]   And I think anything that gets you excited about healthy eating is wonderful, but
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   frozen vegetables and frozen fruits are phenomenal.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.240]   They often contain more nutrients than their fresh counterparts because
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   they're flash frozen at peak ripeness.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.920]   So if you pick broccoli, every bit of its journey from being picked to the
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.680]   grocery store, it's going to go in a truck.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.160]   It might cross the country.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.400]   It might cross several countries to get to you.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.840]   And then it's going to sit on the grocery store shelf for often quite a while before
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.160]   we're actually purchasing it.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.040]   And every little bit of that way, it's losing its nutrients.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.400]   So things like vitamin C especially are really quick to be lost in that journey.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.120]   Whereas if you are getting something flash frozen, it's
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.000]   preserving a lot more of those nutrients.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.480]   So I think we should eat fresh vegetables and fresh fruits as much as we possibly
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.560]   can, but I also think that frozen fruits and veggies can be a really
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.040]   beautiful part of the journey.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.640]   And my frozen veggie roasting hack is like one of my absolute favorites.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.680]   So the thing that you do is you put your frozen veggies, like frozen broccoli,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.240]   let's say out on some parchment paper, and then you put it in the oven at like
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.880]   425 or something like that, but with nothing on it.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.800]   I learned this when I was trying all these different ways to roast chickpeas and make
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.920]   them super, super crispy for my cookbook.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.920]   And people were like, Oh, do it with oil at this point, or you should start
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.080]   with fresh chickpeas or whatever.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.280]   And the thing I found that worked the best is you roast them completely
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.920]   dry, no oil, because the oil traps in the moisture.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.600]   So you want all of that moisture to evaporate, and then you add the oil
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.120]   and then you cook them normally.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.960]   So with the broccoli, you want to like literally not touch it, like dump the
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.080]   bag on the parchment paper, spread it out, put it in the oven, and then roast
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.120]   it until all of that moisture's evaporated, it's already starting to brown a little
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.040]   bit, and then you toss it with the oil, toss it with some salt, toss it with
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   whatever seasonings you want, cook it for five more minutes, and you've got like
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   beautiful frozen roasted broccoli.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.080]   Are there other vegetables it works with?
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.600]   Definitely anything cruciferous.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.360]   So like cauliflower, it works pretty well with Brussels sprouts.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.600]   You're not going to get quite the same effect as you would with like a fresh
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.960]   Brussels sprout, definitely like squash and things like that, that
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.320]   are chopped and pre-prepared.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.360]   Awesome.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.720]   You mentioned adding veggies and you mentioned how to do it if they're frozen.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.040]   Like, are there other good tips for how to take what you do now and make it better?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.480]   And there's like a zillion.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.560]   So if we're in the, if we're in the realm of like still frozen veggies, which I'm
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.440]   really into, one of my favorite hacks is to keep a bag of cauliflower rice in your
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.680]   freezer, and you can buy this at any grocery store, just like pre-prepared
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.600]   cauliflower rice.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.160]   It's just going to be riced cauliflower.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.280]   And then you can use that as a sub for ground beef in pretty much any recipe.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.440]   Like I do half ground beef and then half the cauliflower rice.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.360]   So like a bolognese, you can brown the ground beef and then add the cauliflower
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.720]   rice in, and you won't know that it's there, but you've just added this like
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.080]   significant portion of vegetables to your dish.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.720]   I also think that cauliflower rice is amazing for thickening soups.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.560]   If you're making a soup and it doesn't have as much body, it doesn't have as much
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:26.960]   heft.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.320]   You can take half the soup and then blend it with some sauteed cauliflower rice and
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.480]   then pour that back in.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.720]   And you'll have this really thick and beautiful and rich soup.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.440]   So I think that keeping some frozen cauliflower rice on hand at all times is a
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.200]   really wonderful hack.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.360]   I also love to sub it.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.120]   Like I'll put it in for half of my white rice in a dish.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.520]   So I'll cook up some white rice, delicious, lots of salt.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.800]   That's the secret to making white rice taste really good.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.880]   But then I'll saute up some cauliflower rice and I'll just mix them together.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.480]   I'm not a person who can do cauliflower rice on its own and pretend that it's
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.720]   rice because it's not, and it doesn't taste good.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.440]   And I need my food to taste good.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.520]   And that is like my number one rule of food is that it needs to taste good.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.680]   But mixed in with normal rice, it actually adds like a really nice nutty note.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.040]   And I think enhances the dish and adds veggies instead of detracting from it in
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.480]   any way.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.200]   I'm going to ask what else?
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.280]   Cause frozen cauliflower rice, frozen broccoli, both good hacks.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.520]   So I would say a few things.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.400]   One, use your spices way, way, way more.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.040]   Spices.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   I always call them the original superfood.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.360]   So people are always trying to like go get these like fancy superfood powders
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.960]   and add them to their lives and enhance their health journey that way.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.560]   And that's great.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.400]   If that's what you want to do, wonderful.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.440]   But spices have so many potent therapeutic properties and they make everything you
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.760]   eat tastes really delicious.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.800]   If there's spices listed in a recipe, I almost always pretty much double them.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.760]   Like obviously do it to taste, but people way under season their food and it makes
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.720]   it healthier and it makes it tastier.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.920]   So big fan of that.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.160]   Also a big fan of starting every single morning with a green smoothie, which I
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.960]   would be remiss not to mention.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.680]   I'm sort of like known for my green smoothies, both in my personal life, when
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.520]   I push them on people at all times.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.480]   I have a video on my Instagram where I was testing out different green smoothies
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.200]   until I won over my little sister who hated green smoothies.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.240]   And I did, I got her with a pina colada one, which I was very proud of and she
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.080]   liked it and she drinks green smoothies every single morning now, which I'm
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:31.480]   be very proud of, but also in my public life, I have a green smoothie society on
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.520]   Patreon at patreon.com/lizmoody, which just has all of these green smoothie
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.240]   recipes.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.720]   I think it's a really beautiful thing.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.200]   You can integrate into your day.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.440]   It tastes like a milkshake.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.240]   It takes less than five minutes to make.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.920]   And if you do it in the morning, for instance, you will have had more vegetables
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   before like 9am than most people eat in an entire day, which just makes you feel
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.760]   really good about yourself.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.600]   So I'm a big fan of the all in greens.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.280]   What's in these green smoothies?
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.880]   Okay.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.520]   So the formula is greens and you can do like spinach.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.800]   You can do mixed greens.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.080]   You can do something like arugula, but you need to balance it with, I would say
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.560]   something that's a little peppery that leans into those notes.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.200]   But I'd say for a starter, spinach or mixed greens is a really nice base.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.640]   And then on top of that, you're going to do a banana.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   I would say we'll make it taste really good.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.000]   You're not going to taste the banana, but if you're just going for a delicious
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.440]   flavor, put the banana in there.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   I have some recipes without if you're banana free, but good starter.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.360]   And then you want some sort of fat.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.400]   So that can be an avocado.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.680]   That can be Greek yogurt.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.120]   That can be a nut or a seed.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.480]   I think like pistachio is a really fun thing to include in a smoothie.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.760]   That can be chia seeds.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.680]   That can be flax seeds.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.600]   That can be hemp seeds.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.760]   That can be a nut butter, but some sort of nut or some sort of fat to get the
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.280]   nutrient absorption from the vegetables that you're putting in.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.560]   So something like greens has a lot of fat soluble vitamins in them.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.800]   And you want to make sure that you're actually absorbing all of
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.520]   those vitamins from those greens.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.200]   So some sort of fat, and that's also going to help you stay full through
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.640]   lunch, which is what we want.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.080]   That said, if your green smoothie does not make you full, please eat some food.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.520]   That's very important to me.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.760]   This is not meant to be a diet thing.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.000]   This is again, not meant to be restrictive in any way, shape, or form.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.840]   If you're hungry, listen to your body, eat.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.560]   A lot of people will do a green smoothie with like scrambled egg on
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.000]   the side or something like that.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.880]   I switch it up.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.200]   Some days a green smoothie is enough.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.280]   Some days I like to have a more robust breakfast.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.240]   So I go either way.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.160]   So we've got our greens, our banana, our fat, and then you want to add some protein.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.720]   So if you're using some nuts or seeds, they're going to have
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.960]   a certain amount of protein.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.800]   You can also add in something like a protein powder.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.040]   You can add in collagen.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.560]   Again, that protein is going to elongate your blood sugar curve and
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.920]   it's going to keep you full longer.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.480]   So that's really important.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.600]   I like to add some frozen berries, usually like blueberries or
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.040]   blackberries or strawberries.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.320]   And then I like to put in like my fun flavor elements.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.680]   So this can be spices.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.200]   I love cinnamon in smoothies.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.680]   I love cardamom in smoothies.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.760]   I love cayenne is like a little bit of spice in a smoothie.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   I love cacao, which just makes it taste like chocolate, which
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.720]   is the dream and everything.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.960]   I also love zest.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.920]   So using like some lemon zest or some orange zest, it has so many
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.760]   therapeutic properties, the skin of the citrus, but it also tastes
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.240]   really strongly of that thing.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.400]   So if you put like orange juice in your smoothie, putting orange
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.000]   zest in the smoothie will taste even more orangey essentially,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.880]   which is really nice.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.320]   And then a little pinch of sea salt, which is just gonna bring
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.520]   out all of those flavors.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.440]   You always want a little bit of salt in anything that you cook.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.000]   Even if it's a sweet thing, we put salt in our cookies.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.880]   It brings out those flavors.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.600]   And it also adds some minerals if you're using a sea salt or a mineral
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.720]   salt or something like that.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.840]   And then I just add water.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.640]   I think that blending your smoothies with a nut milk is a huge waste of money.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.680]   Like, what are we looking for?
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.760]   Save your nut milk for your fruity pebbles and use water in your
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.360]   smoothies, blend it up and drink it.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.520]   And then they also keep for, I'd say 24 hours solidly in a tightly
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.800]   sealed container in the fridge.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.480]   So if you want to make a smoothie for two days, which I love doing a
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.600]   little gift from past you, highly recommend that as well.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.320]   I love it.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   I want to go back to your previous comment on spices and ask, do
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.280]   you replace your spices regularly?
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.400]   I always wonder if this spice rack that I assume we probably bought 15
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.680]   years ago or something is, have they expired?
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   Do they go bad?
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.440]   They don't go bad per se.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.480]   Like you're not probably going to get food poisoning or something
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.520]   like that from your spices, but they will lose their potency in terms of
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.280]   both flavor and therapeutic benefits.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.560]   If you want to know if your spice is still giving you all those
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.600]   therapeutic benefits, you can literally just taste it.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.360]   And if it doesn't taste robust and of that thing, then you've probably lost
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.760]   a fair amount of the therapeutic benefits.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.720]   So there's a few things you can do to prevent that.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.600]   You want to keep your spices somewhere as cold and dark and dry as possible.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.200]   So in a cabinet, not right next to your stove, not lined up on your wall where
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.760]   the sun is coming in every single day, just as cold and dark and dry as
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.880]   possible, and that will make them last longer and then seal them as well
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.720]   as possible and then use them more.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.360]   It's a little bit tricky because I feel like by having them put away, you're
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.440]   maybe not as inspired to use them.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.040]   So take inventory regularly, put them in your dishes so that they're not dying
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.560]   before you get the chance to use them.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.840]   And how long would you say the average spice lasts?
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.240]   I'd say like a year.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.760]   So would you do like a turnover of your whole spice drawer?
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   I don't because I use them all.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.920]   I would say most of the spices in our spice drawer that we don't use a lot
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.320]   of are like five plus years old.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.840]   So maybe before you leave, since we're in person, give me a little spice inventory.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.000]   Well, and I would also say that I don't think you need maybe
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.720]   as many spices as you think.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.560]   So sometimes people go and they try to do like this fully stocked spice
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.480]   rack, but then they realize they're really just using the same five or six
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.360]   spices on a regular basis and maybe lean into those spices.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.240]   And if a recipe has like 45 spices, be like, do I really need all of these?
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.480]   Can I experiment with getting most of the way there with what I have?
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.920]   I also think that spice blends are super underutilized.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.320]   So instead of buying all of the spices in something, have one or two
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.280]   go-to spice blends that you're always using.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.240]   If you want to like roast vegetables and have it taste really good.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.480]   If you're doing a stir fry and you want to have it taste really good.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.040]   You have your spice blends that you can go through with that.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.240]   And that way you can use it up much more quickly.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.760]   I love it.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.440]   Now I'm getting hungry and we don't have dinner plans at this house tonight.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.480]   So I'm curious.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.480]   Pick a recipe from your cookbook that I and anyone listening
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.640]   can make for a meal tonight that you think will just make everyone happy.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.720]   Ooh. OK.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.880]   That I can also link to so people can try it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to think.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.800]   Yeah. So this isn't up yet, but it will be up by the time that this goes up.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's a taco salad.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.800]   I like salad, but the salad has to take like really, really, really good
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.880]   if I'm going to eat salad.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.480]   And so I'm a big fan of like hearty salads and exciting salads
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.160]   and things like that.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.960]   And I had a taco salad out at a restaurant in the Bay Area
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.440]   and I was deeply disappointed by it.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.200]   And I was like, this could be so much better.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.800]   So this is just a very quick and easy taco salad.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.040]   The taco meat is plant based, not because I am plant based,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.440]   but because I thought it actually tasted better that way.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.560]   So I call it accidentally plant based.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.600]   It's a mix of pecans and frozen cauliflower rice.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.120]   So you can pull out your frozen cauliflower rice and make that with that.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.480]   And then it's just quickly seasoned.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.720]   And then everything else you're just like chopping up
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.240]   and you're making a really quick jalapeno dressing, which I love
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.880]   and pouring it over the top.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.040]   It's going to be really nourishing.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.240]   It's going to be really delicious
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.760]   and it's going to make you feel really, really good after you eat it.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.120]   All right. We will link to that in the show notes.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.800]   Yes. I noticed looking at the cookbook, gluten free, dairy free and plant centered.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.160]   Is that because you are gluten free and dairy free, or is that
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.640]   because you feel like that's a healthier way to live?
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.000]   Or how did you make that call?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.160]   So for a few reasons, if I'm going to be completely honest,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.480]   it's because the powers that be at publishing houses like marketing terms.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.400]   And so those are easy marketing terms that help people identify.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.200]   It's and I get it.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.320]   You know, if you're looking at a cookbook cover on Amazon,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.280]   you need to be able to tell so quickly whether that's something
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.800]   that you're going to want in your life.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.080]   So identifying terms like that are really, really important.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.400]   Also, I'm trying to make my food as accessible to as many people as possible.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.320]   And there definitely are people out there
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.600]   with celiac disease, with allergies and things like that.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.840]   So the book says plant centered.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.160]   What's the take on plants?
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.760]   I would say plant forward.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.560]   One hundred percent.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.760]   I am trying to smush in vegetables whenever possible.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.280]   I'm the biggest fan of them.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.440]   I've interviewed probably thousands of doctors at this point in my life.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.920]   And it's so interesting because they disagree about so many things
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.800]   about what constitutes a healthy diet.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.880]   But the one thing they all agree on is that like more vegetables is better.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.840]   80% or so of your diet should just be like focusing on putting vegetables in.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.680]   So I'm like, let's stop arguing over that last little bit
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.040]   about whether like meat or no meat or grains or no grains.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.480]   If we all just got the vegetable part right, we would all feel so much better.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.120]   We're arguing about that tiny tweaky bit when we don't have the foundation laid.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   And I think that happens with a lot of wellness stuff.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.400]   We're trying to like hyper optimize instead of laying the foundation
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.640]   that would actually make the difference.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.120]   So I would say plant forward.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.520]   One hundred percent. Vegetables are the foundation.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.000]   I'm going to smush them in anywhere.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.880]   But I don't follow any food rules with my diet.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.120]   And I think unless you have a specific health reason,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.520]   something like celiac disease or an allergy or something like that,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.240]   I would not encourage anybody to follow any restrictive rules either.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.520]   Perfect. And for all those vegetables, do you feel like vegetables, fruits,
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.240]   anything, do they all need to be organic or what's your stance on organic food?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.520]   So, look, I think that we all do the best that we can
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.920]   within the circumstances that we have.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.840]   The reasons to buy organic are a few.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.280]   Like, obviously, there's pesticides and things that you maybe don't want in your body.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.320]   And then I think you can follow easily something like the Clean 15
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.720]   and the Dirty Dozen, which you can easily look up online.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.080]   And that's basically a list of produce
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.760]   that is going to be more likely to be sprayed with pesticides
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.120]   or things that you'd put in your body.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.400]   You can also follow easy rules like bananas, avocados,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.040]   things that you're not eating the skin.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.320]   You probably don't need to spend your money on organic.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.400]   But then there's also issues with a lot of organic farming practices
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.960]   where they're using heavy metals and other things
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.840]   that you maybe don't want in your body as well.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.240]   So I think that it's complicated and it's nuanced.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.280]   And the best way to get around it is by knowing your farmer as much as possible.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.480]   And obviously, that's a very privileged thing to do.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.920]   But I do think if you can go to a farmer's market and ask how they're farming,
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.360]   what they're using when they're growing, that's the absolute best practice.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.880]   And then beyond that, I would say in general, roughly,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.640]   if you can afford to buy organic, do it for things that you are eating the skin of.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.200]   Like when I was talking about the zesting, if you can get that organic, great.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.040]   That's really nice.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.880]   And if you can't, then don't sweat it.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.200]   There is never a circumstance in which it's worse for you to be eating the produce.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.720]   If you're like, I can't afford organic produce, should I be buying produce?
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.120]   Yes, 100 percent.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.880]   It's still the best thing you should be putting into your body.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.680]   Do you feel similarly about meats?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.720]   I think meats are a little bit trickier for me.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   I would say that I lean towards grass fed pasture raised ethical practices.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.560]   I'm also a borderline meat eater, as is for ethical reasons
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.760]   and environmental reasons.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   So if I'm going to eat meat, I really want it to have been raised
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.640]   in as ethical a way as possible, I think, because we're talking about a living creature.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.920]   It's a little bit different than when we're talking about a carrot.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.360]   Well, you haven't mentioned anything about supplements,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.800]   vitamins, that kind of stuff.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.960]   Do those have a role in like a healthy lifestyle?
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.000]   I think they absolutely can and do.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.200]   But I think it depends what your goals are.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.440]   I hate when you open somebody's supplement cabinet and they have so many of them
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.520]   and you're like, well, what are these for?
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.600]   And they're like, I don't know.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.280]   It's part of being healthy.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.240]   And I think you should be able to point to every single supplement
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.320]   that you are taking and say, this is the need that it's filling.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.920]   This is the problem that it's solving.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.480]   So for me, for instance, I don't eat seafood at all.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.720]   I take fish oil.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.600]   I know that having omega threes in my diet is really good for my brain.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.400]   It's really good for my overall health.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.280]   So that is why I take my fish oil supplement.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.040]   I think that if you're willy nilly attacking it and taking too many,
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.240]   you're probably not having the positive effects that you want.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.480]   You're probably wasting a lot of money.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   And it should be a lot more of a thoughtful practice than people are using it for.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.960]   Is that the same with like a daily vitamin?
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   We were talking about this off air a little bit.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.320]   I take athletic greens.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.920]   I love athletic greens.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.360]   I think that something like a daily vitamin, particularly if it's a vitamin
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.280]   like athletic greens that sourced in a whole food form,
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.320]   it's a really nice nutritional insurance.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.840]   So a lot of us would like to eat a lot better than we are eating,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.640]   or we don't have time to make these robust veggie rich meals.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.360]   And also, there is some truth to the fact that produce doesn't necessarily
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.600]   have the same nutrient profile that it would have at one point.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.880]   The soil has been really depleted through farming practices, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.280]   So I think that it's a nice practice to have a little bit of insurance.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.920]   But again, it's a nice to have.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.800]   And if all you can afford is really good produce, like do that.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.920]   Your number one thing I want you spending money on is really good produce.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.600]   Like if you can fill your diet with vegetables, you will feel better
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.880]   than almost any other practice that you can add in.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.720]   And then everything else, it's bonuses.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.160]   It's a little bit of a cherry on top.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.000]   So stack your Sunday again, lay those foundations.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.520]   And then if you want to add the cherry on top of that, all the better.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.080]   And when you say really good produce, do you mean fresh?
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.640]   I mean, what's the really good?
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.160]   So I mean, like a diverse, beautiful array of produce,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.280]   something that gets lost in the produce conversation often
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.880]   and in the healthy eating conversation is how much diversity is important
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.080]   to our health.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.320]   So I've interviewed a number of gut health experts, and people are always
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.520]   like looking for these little gut health hacks.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.000]   And it really comes down to eat as many types of plants
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.480]   as you possibly can on as regular of a basis as you can.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.080]   So if you're regularly eating broccoli, maybe try Brussels sprouts,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.480]   maybe try cauliflower.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.640]   If you're making your smoothie with spinach all the time,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.520]   maybe swap in some mixed greens.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.360]   If you have pretty much any dish, add some fresh herbs on top.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.440]   That's a type of produce, and it's going to make it taste better.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.560]   It's going to make it look more visually appealing.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.720]   So just as large of a variety as possible, as much diversity as possible,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.880]   it's going to feed your gut microbiome.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.680]   You're going to be really happy.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.920]   It sounds great.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.280]   One of our favorite things to do, and I can put a link in the show notes,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.120]   but you don't need it, is to literally go to the farmer's market
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.160]   and just buy all the vegetables and make a crazy big stir fry
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.080]   with just all vegetables. I love that.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.960]   There's probably 10 or 12 vegetables in it at any given time.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.200]   And it's really good. Yeah.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.360]   And again, it's like about finding the ways to make the vegetables
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.920]   taste really good, because if you're sitting there
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.840]   and you're like stabbing a sad piece of broccoli,
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.080]   you're not going to enjoy the process of eating.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.000]   And also, there's some really interesting studies that show that the mood
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   that you're in when you're consuming food literally impacts your digestion,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.320]   impacts your nutrient absorption.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.640]   So making food tasty actually technically makes it better for you, too.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.840]   I like it.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.040]   Being a parent can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.760]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.040]   or the indescribable pain of stepping on tiny plastic dinosaurs
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.680]   in your bare feet, both of which happened to me recently.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.000]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.120]   especially when you do it with Fabric,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.520]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.760]   Fabric by Gerber Life was designed by parents for parents

[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.880]   And when I say surprisingly affordable, I actually went online
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.680]   to compare prices and found Fabric to be highly competitive
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.880]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.920]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.760]   not available in certain states.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.360]   Price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.040]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.640]   almost every day, and that's thanks to Viori.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.280]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.560]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.440]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.960]   or feel like it at all.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.720]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.520]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.400]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.880]   you're wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viori,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.640]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.440]   And it's not just for men.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.080]   My wife is as obsessed with Viori as I am.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.760]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.680]   I think I have three pairs, and they are probably the most
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.520]   comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.280]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.560]   whether it's running, training or yoga.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.240]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.800]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.160]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.400]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.640]   your first purchase, as well as free shipping and returns

[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.400]   or in the link in the show notes.

[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.880]   some of the most comfortable and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.520]   OK, let's get out of food for a moment.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.000]   Talk about hacks related to health, what you've written about,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.600]   what you blog about, what you podcast about.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.800]   It's like about being healthier with people.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.480]   What have you got?
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.440]   I know there are a bunch of things you do in your routine.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.680]   Let's talk about some.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.400]   So a hack that I'm loving right now is to set the bar way lower.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.560]   So I think a lot of people think about something like working out
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.280]   or meditation, and they're like, I don't know, I'm so busy already.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.360]   Like, I know these things are good for me, but how do I actually fit them
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.120]   into my life? And I think that if instead of sitting down and being like,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.760]   well, I have to do 20 minutes of meditation to make it effective,
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.920]   you're like, I'm going to do five minutes of meditation.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.880]   I'm going to do 10 minutes of meditation.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.680]   First of all, it makes it so much more achievable and attainable.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.440]   And if something is achievable and attainable,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.640]   you're so much more likely to keep going at it.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.920]   You're not going to try to do it for a week, fail and give up.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.480]   But then also, most of the time when you sit down
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.800]   and try to meditate for 10 minutes, you're going to love it.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.200]   It's going to feel really good.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.720]   And you might even want to keep going or maybe you'll do 10 minutes for a week.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.040]   And then the next week, you'll do 11 minutes.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.840]   The next week you'll do 12 minutes.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.120]   And actually, I had a woman on my podcast who studies focus
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.760]   and she studies meditation and its effects on your brain.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.120]   And 12 minutes is literally the minimum viable dose
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.480]   to have incredibly potent neurological effects.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.720]   So if you're one of those people who feels scattered all the time,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.600]   you like go to answer an email and then you find yourself on Instagram
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.640]   and you don't even know how your phone got into your hand.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.760]   Doing just 12 minutes of mindfulness practice
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.280]   every single day will massively help that type of thing.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.240]   It'll help you focus your attention.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.600]   It'll help you use your attention in the way that you want to use your attention.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.440]   So that's so much less than most of us think.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.640]   And by the way, that's not even every single day she does that.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.680]   I think four to five days a week was the study.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.200]   So 12 minutes, four to five days a week.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.440]   Same thing with working out.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.120]   I had a doctor on my podcast for a Ask the Doctor burnout edition.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.760]   So we talked all about what are the causes of burnout in our bodies,
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.160]   in our brains, and how can we address them?
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   We were talking about the minimum viable dose of working out.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.760]   And it's anything that gives you a state of change.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.920]   So anything that makes it so that you sweat, so that your heart rate goes up.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.520]   That is, quote unquote, enough.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.760]   And I think that bar is so much lower than get in your car,
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.200]   driving to the gym, doing an hour class and yelling at yourself
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.880]   if you're not doing all of those things.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.520]   So one of my favorite hacks is anything that you want to do in your life.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.560]   Make it easier.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.360]   Make it less of a time commitment and make it fun.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.880]   That's another really good hack, is that anything that you want to do,
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.560]   if you can make it enjoyable, which sounds so silly, you're like, of course,
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.560]   like if you make something enjoyable, it will be easier to do.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.840]   But I think there's this pervasive attitude with wellness
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.520]   that unless you're beating yourself up, it's not really wellness,
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.560]   that there's an element of suffering involved.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.880]   And that's not true at all.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.240]   So, for instance, I had Katie Melkman on my podcast and she studies
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.360]   how we can essentially make the choices that we want to make
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.680]   and actually stick to them, how we can make those changes.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.160]   And one of her favorite things that she recommends
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.960]   is taking something that you really love.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.040]   So if you really love like a TV show or a specific podcast,
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.840]   like all the hacks are healthier together.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.800]   Save the podcast for some time that you doing something
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.920]   that's a little bit hard for you to motivate yourself to do.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.160]   So for me, that's working out.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.120]   I hate working out.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.200]   If I could just lay on the couch like a potato for the rest of my life,
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.360]   I would absolutely do it.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.720]   But I know that I feel so much better after I work out.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.560]   So I say my favorite podcast, I only listen to them when I work out.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   And then I get excited to work out because I'm like, oh, my gosh,
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.880]   I get to listen to my favorite podcast.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.520]   You can put on music that you love while doing your taxes.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.400]   You can have a little treat like a food that you eat or a favorite wine
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.360]   or something like that, or a friend that you call when you go for walks.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.560]   There's all these ways to sort of pair the thing that you really,
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.640]   really love with the thing
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.400]   that you have a harder time motivating yourself to do.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.600]   And it makes it fun and it creates that association in your brain
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.640]   so that you start to love the thing that you thought
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.280]   you didn't love in the first place.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.880]   Does that mean that you wouldn't listen to your favorite podcast?
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.280]   It does, yeah. Unless you're working out.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.680]   She recommends saving the things that like you really love
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.000]   that really motivate you for when you're doing the hard things.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.080]   I like that.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.960]   And I know meditation, because I've heard you talk about
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.840]   it was something that you tried for a while and it just didn't stick.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.120]   And I know I have.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.040]   And many people have been like, yeah, I downloaded Headspace and I did that.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.880]   And then it didn't work.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.200]   And you found a way to make it work.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.120]   Can you talk a little bit about that journey?
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.600]   So my meditation journey has been really interesting.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.120]   I started meditating during what I like to call my mental breakdown period.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:45.680]   I was living in London with my now husband and I became completely agoraphobic.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.520]   I started having panic attacks whenever I left the house.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.560]   And that's the beginning of my wellness journey in general.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.720]   I was like laying prone in bed and emailing sources
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.480]   about how I could essentially stop having panic attacks at every single second.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.760]   And a lot of them recommended meditation, which really surprised me
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.640]   because I was reaching out to people more in the hard science arena.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.720]   They also recommended foods and supplements.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.400]   And that's how I began to cobble together my personal wellness journey.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.160]   So I tried meditating with Headspace and it did help a little bit.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.880]   I will say that Andy Puddingcombe has like a very soothing voice.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.520]   It's a nice, nice British tones in there.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.960]   And I was in England and that was probably the only British person
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.920]   that I was like regularly having interactions with was Andy Puddingcombe in my ears.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.480]   So I do think that it helped a little bit.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.000]   And then later for a story, I did Vedic meditation training,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.960]   which is much like transcendental meditation training.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.160]   And that worked for me, but not for the reasons that you might think.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.600]   So TM is a mantra based meditation.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.560]   So you're you get a secret mantra.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.400]   You like go you pay money and then you go to this five day workshop.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.600]   They whisper to you your secret mantra.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.920]   I don't know where it comes from.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.880]   They like tell you your mantra.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.480]   And I think the idea is that like if you went to five different teachers,
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.000]   they like tell you the same mantra based on I don't know.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.680]   I literally don't know what is based on like your height or your vibe
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.040]   or your energy or like your name, but you get your mantra.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.360]   You're not supposed to tell it to anybody.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.120]   So I don't know my husband's mantra and he doesn't know my mantra,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.280]   but he knows my Gmail password.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.000]   And then you repeat that mantra to yourself in your head over and over
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.360]   and over when you meditate.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.640]   So one of the reasons that I think it works is because it focuses
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.080]   your attention instead of being like, don't think about anything,
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.440]   which makes you think about everything.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.560]   You have a thing to think about.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.280]   You just think about your mantra over and over.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.360]   So I think you could use literally any mantra and it would have that effect.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.960]   So hum is a really great starter mantra.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.040]   You can just sit there and repeat.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.680]   So hum to yourself in your head.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.960]   And I think it'll have a really positive effect.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.680]   You can also just sit there and watch your breath or you could listen to Andy.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.720]   And that's great.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.920]   But the other reason that I think that it was so effective
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.720]   was because it was really expensive.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.840]   And I think that making an investment in something
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.720]   in that way is so motivating in a way that we don't talk about.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   So instead of being like, well, I don't feel like meditating today,
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.280]   I was like, oh, I spent five hundred dollars on this stupid course.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.000]   You better meditate to make it worth the money that you spent on the course.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.200]   So I do think that to the extent that you have the privilege
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.000]   to make a financial investment in something, it works for something
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.360]   like booking a workout class in advance.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:24.120]   Or there's even sites where you can like bet against your ability to do something.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.440]   So if you want to quit smoking or you want to work out every day
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.840]   or something like that, I do think if you can tie your finances
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.560]   in with it a little bit, it is weirdly motivating.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.440]   So I've been a pretty regular meditator.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.760]   Again, my bar is low.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.440]   I don't think I need to be perfect.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.160]   I don't need to do it every single day and I don't break myself ever.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.640]   But I do think that putting the cost investment on the line
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.720]   was a really big motivating factor for it finally sticking.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.040]   That's awesome. Yeah.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.800]   I know a handful of people that swear by their mantra.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.440]   And every time I'm like, I don't understand it.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.120]   What is the mantra? No one will ever share.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.320]   I should look into it.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.040]   Where does the mantra come from?
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.840]   I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.280]   I have no idea. You should try it.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.320]   Do you meditate?
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.080]   I have spent time with it.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.280]   Hotel might have like a breath meditation class.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.400]   We'll go do it. It's not I'm not afraid of it.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.560]   But I just have not ever found a way to make it stick.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.960]   But it's something that it's like on that long list of things
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.000]   that I want to bring back into life, but has been on the list for years.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.440]   I also find it helpful to literally look up all of the health benefits of it,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.680]   because the second that you are aware of all of the massive benefits
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.800]   you can get in your life by doing something like meditating,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.720]   it just becomes so much more motivated on the focus episode of the podcast.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.520]   We talked about whether you could just do activities mindfully,
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.440]   like mindfully wash your dishes or mindfully go for a walk.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.080]   And that does have a certain amount of benefits,
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.320]   but not nearly the same benefits as that concentrated dose
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.400]   of mindfulness of 12 minutes a day, which you talked about.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.680]   Interestingly, it's partially like training ourselves to sit in discomfort
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.840]   and training ourselves to not like the experience in a way.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.200]   I like that, like forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.440]   A few other things that I know you at least regularly do.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   Yeah. Cold showers. Cold showers.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.920]   I know we talked about this on my when I interviewed you.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.240]   You don't do them.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.200]   Well, it's funny. Sometimes I want a cold shower.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   It's not about if you want a cold shower.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   So I don't have a practice of forcing myself to take a cold shower.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.320]   But sometimes I'm like, I just kind of enjoy a cold shower right now.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.560]   My wife thinks I'm crazy.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.000]   When you're in like Colombia or like just in normal life.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.280]   Like some days I'm like, I'm running hot today
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.880]   and I'll take a shower and I'll just like it's not the coldest it gets,
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.800]   but it's by no means warm. Right.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.360]   But I think what you do is not that it is not that.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.880]   And I would actually say that wanting to do it.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.480]   Almost takes away from the reason that we do it.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.680]   And when I explain why, you'll understand.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.640]   So first of all, I want to preface, I do not do the whole shower cold,
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   like I am shampoo weed and washing my body in a nice, warm, toasty shower
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.920]   like you might think.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.520]   And then at the very end, I breathe in really deeply
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.200]   and I turn the thing to as cold as it gets.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   And the idea is you want to be as cold as you can comfortably be
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.800]   without feeling like you're in any sort of danger in any way.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.640]   So I go as cold as possible.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.320]   And I do a minute is my goal.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.280]   Always, again, kind of having those lower goalposts.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.920]   But sometimes I'll go a minute and a half up to two minutes.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.240]   I think aiming for 12 to 15 minutes a week is ideal. Not a day.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.000]   I mean, I mean, when I heard 12 to 15 minutes, I was like, wow,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.520]   I got 12 minutes of meditation today, 12 minutes of cold, 12 to 15 minutes a week,
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.360]   which is not that much.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.120]   And again, you're kind of like habit stacking.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.480]   You're in the shower already.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.080]   I like it because it's this tiny, tiny, tiny thing that you can do
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.880]   that will have a big effect on your health.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.720]   So you're like, what is the effect on your health?
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.880]   First of all, if you're vain, a cold shower is going to make your skin glow.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.480]   It's going to make your hair really shiny.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.240]   So if you want to look really pretty, which I can tell by your face,
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.840]   you're like, this is appealing to me.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   Of course, if that is the goal, it's going to help with that.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.480]   So the same reason you see people do like their ice rollers for inflammation
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.560]   and like face puffiness, the cold shower is going to have that effect.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.960]   But basically on your entire body. Wonderful.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.480]   The reason I do it, though, is to help balance my dopamine levels.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.840]   So do you know, Dr.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.480]   Anna Lemke? I do not.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:18.840]   She is a wonderful Stanford professor who basically her entire practice
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.000]   is devoted to studying dopamine.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.560]   And dopamine is the neurochemical of motivation.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.280]   I think people confuse it with serotonin a lot.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.960]   And I certainly did before I interviewed her.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.880]   It's not the chemical of happiness. It's about motivation.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.520]   It's about our desire and drive to do things.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.800]   And so a lot of the technology that we use, drugs and alcohol,
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.920]   these things that are like so easy to motivate yourself to do,
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.680]   it's because they encourage your dopamine receptors
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.600]   to essentially pump out dopamine.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   But when you do that, your dopamine can essentially get out of balance,
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.480]   which has a number of pretty negative effects on you.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.840]   It makes it harder for you to be motivated to do the things
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.160]   that you want to do in your life.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.000]   And it can also make it harder for you to find pleasure
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.480]   in the simple things like going for a walk or watching the sunset
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.360]   or just these like little moments.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.120]   It's why I think sometimes you'll see like a group of friends
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.400]   out at dinner together.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.080]   And instead of wanting to talk to each other,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.720]   they're all like wanting to be on their phones.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.880]   And you're doing the fun thing like you're out with your friends.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.080]   But that dopamine imbalance is causing you to want to reach
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.040]   for your technology, even in those moments.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.440]   So if we can do things that feel a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.520]   we can bring our dopamine back into balance,
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.000]   which will make it easier for us to motivate ourselves to do hard things
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.280]   in the other facets of our lives and easier for us to experience pleasure
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.480]   in those like smaller moments that aren't causing these huge dopamine bursts.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.280]   So hard things include things like cold showers.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.960]   So if you can just add in this little moment of being uncomfortable,
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.040]   of pushing yourself to do something that's a little bit difficult for you,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.160]   it has all of these longer outsized positive effects.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.240]   By the way, it doesn't need to just be a cold shower.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.720]   She mentioned in the episode walking to get groceries in the rain.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.480]   The big takeaway for me was that discomfort
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.600]   isn't something that we're trying to eliminate from our lives.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.320]   Discomfort actually has this really positive and balancing effect.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.400]   So if you find yourself as the type of person who's always reaching for your phone,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.440]   who has a hard time getting motivated, who isn't sure
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.920]   like where they can find those little moments of pleasure in their life,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.640]   I think looking and leaning into those moments of discomfort
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.120]   can feel really satisfying.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   There are also a lot of health benefits of cold water as a therapy.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.000]   So you didn't even mention like all that world.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.880]   But I know that Cold Plunges and Wim Hof, who some people listening know,
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.880]   other people can Google, has done a ton of stuff
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.680]   with the health benefits of cold water therapy.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   And I think a lot of that comes down to inflammation.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.200]   I think if we can sort of manage our inflammation levels at a base state,
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.720]   it has these cascading positive effects on our bodies.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:10.840]   But for me, as a person who finds it very hard to do hard things,
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.280]   I like the idea that I can do this one little hard thing
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.840]   and I'll make all the other hard things feel so much easier.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   I love it. To get very specific, you turn on the cold water.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:24.040]   Yeah. Are you then like showering, splashing all over, getting it everywhere?
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.840]   Are you just like standing there frozen?
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.200]   So first I do my face because again, I'm trying for my glowing skin effects.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.640]   So I am vain.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.080]   And so I first put my face on her.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.040]   That's horrible. It's excruciating.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.200]   But I do that probably for like 20 to 30 seconds.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.440]   Then I do my front and then I turn around and I do my back.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.800]   I do try to kind of do right on the back of my neck
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.280]   because that encourages brown fat in your body,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.600]   which has a whole host of positive effects.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.280]   Look up brown fat if you would like to.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.600]   And then I just try to withstand it
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.240]   as long as I possibly can until I turn it off and get out.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.360]   And again, I give myself full permission to stop at 60 seconds every single time.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   I think that keeping it as quick as possible
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.840]   in the 60 seconds goes by really fast, you know.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.000]   I like it. I will. Will you try it?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.400]   I will try. You commit to try it for this is another wellness thing.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.680]   I think that we often are like, oh, I like did the wellness thing.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.240]   Where's my great effect?
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.760]   But you're not using it long enough and not using it
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.720]   consistently enough to get those benefits.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.320]   So add in your vegetables. Do it for a month.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.920]   Do your workout for a month or two before you start sitting around
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.960]   and being like, why isn't it working? Meditate for a month or two.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.320]   So how long are you going to commit to doing your cold showers for? Hmm.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.720]   It's funny because we have a hot tub and I was like,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.080]   maybe I should just turn the water and just let it get cold
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.960]   and then just do like the full submersion because funny enough,
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.080]   you know that you can buy a I know that we in a conversation in a past episode,
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   I talked about the DIY versus like the fancy, expensive one.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.920]   I'm down to experiment.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.960]   So this I do think, though, you're immediately trying to complicate it.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.080]   And I feel like do the plunge thing later.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.360]   Yeah. Transform your hot tub later.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.480]   But for right now, literally with doing nothing,
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.800]   you could take a cold shower at the end of your shower today.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.880]   So I'm like, set your bar a little lower.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.600]   I'll try it for April.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.720]   OK. All of April.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   And then will you like announce on Twitter or something how it went for you?
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.520]   I'll just talk about it. I'll bring it up.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.280]   Bring on the podcast. Yeah. Or do it.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.400]   Yeah. Stay tuned for Chris's cold shower journey.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.720]   I'm going to do cold showers for a month.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.840]   Let's everybody should join you to anybody listening.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.200]   Who hasn't a cold shower? Join Chris on his cold shower journey.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.080]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.240]   But by the time you hear this, maybe you'll make it. May. Yeah.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:37.440]   OK, it's funny that Liz was talking about athletic greens
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.880]   because I'm also a huge fan and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.080]   for this episode.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.360]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.480]   And I've kept it in my daily routine for over a month now.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.120]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.920]   add a few ice cubes and head to my office for the day.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.840]   Look, I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.120]   But the reality is that I am not.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.000]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.440]   And it's a bonus that it happens to taste great.

[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:54.200]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.080]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.240]   and you have too many manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.280]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.480]   Thirty seven thousand twenty five one.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.000]   Thirty seven thousand.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.400]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.760]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.160]   What about circadian walks?
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.240]   Sounds much more pleasurable than a cold shower.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.400]   I love my circ walk.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.720]   So the circadian walk is the idea.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.360]   I don't know if you've heard of a hot girl walk, but that's just like
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.840]   I have not heard of a hot girl walk.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.160]   It's literally just walking.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.960]   And I think there's a lot of different ways
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.560]   that people are trying to make something as simple and wonderful
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.840]   as walking like trendy and circadian walks
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:03.560]   essentially bring a little bit of science into the age old practice of walking,
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.400]   which is a really beautiful and wonderful practice.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.840]   Speaking of the focus episode, she said one of the best ways
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.160]   if you want to like regain focus for a meeting or something like that
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.640]   is just go for like a 10 minute walk, something where you can look a long ways
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.920]   in the distance, where you're not thinking about anything directed.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.640]   And if you have like a big meeting or a speech or presentation,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.480]   it'll help massively with reinvigorating that focus.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:27.720]   But a circadian walk, you get the benefits of ambulation of walking,
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.520]   but also you're going to help control your circadian rhythm.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.320]   So this is a 10 minute walk outside before 10 a.m.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.480]   to help set your circadian rhythm for your day.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.040]   What is your circadian rhythm?
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.240]   Do you know your circadian rhythm is?
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   I probably am not going to explain it like you would, but the kind of general.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.880]   Yeah, just let you explain.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.040]   So your circadian rhythm,
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.760]   I think a lot of people think about it in the context of sleep.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   So it does impact your sleep hugely.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.440]   And I would say if you go for a circadian walk again,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.840]   10 minutes outside before 10 a.m. for, I'd say, a week or two,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.240]   you'll probably start to notice some really positive effects in your sleep.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.640]   But your circadian rhythm also impacts so much more than that.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   Pretty much every single part of your body is running on its own little clock,
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.680]   like your digestion is running on its own little circadian rhythm, your hormones.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.600]   So when you set your circadian rhythm,
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.520]   when you encourage your circadian rhythm to function optimally,
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.960]   you're actually having all of these downstream effects of it
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.880]   outside of just your sleep being better.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.560]   You do not have to walk.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.520]   You can just stand there and look at the sun.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.400]   I do think there's like minor benefits to moving your body.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.760]   It helps wake you up if you're going to just stand there.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.360]   Why not? But sometimes I will if I'm feeling very lazy.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.520]   But then I'd say the second circadian walk is the walk that's right
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.800]   as the sun is going down.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.640]   So the number one time if you can do it is in the morning.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.480]   Closer to when you wake up is better.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.520]   But I would say 10 a.m.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.760]   sort of the cutoff to get the benefits.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.120]   And then if you can also do it as the sun is going down,
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.760]   as you're getting those sort of like pinky, orangey, yellow tones of sunset.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.720]   Again, that will help kind of encourage your circadian rhythm
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.560]   to function at its optimal level, which is going to help your sleep.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.760]   It's going to help your mood.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.160]   It's going to help your hormones.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.000]   It's going to help your digestion the whole the whole nine yards.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.080]   I love it. What other things in your routine are you doing?
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.720]   We got cold showers. We got circadian walks. Yeah.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.400]   OK, so here's a weird one.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.680]   Do you know what hydroxyapatite is?
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.600]   No, I just assume the answer to all of these obscure questions.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:30.760]   The answer is just so hydroxyapatite is it's a fluoride alternative in toothpaste.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.880]   So I do these like ask the doctor episodes
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.480]   where I do deep dives with functional medicine practitioners.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.920]   And I had a dentist on and I hear all the time people are like,
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.600]   oh, I don't want to listen to the dentist episode because that sounds really boring.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:45.120]   But the more that we find out about our mouths, the more that we're finding out
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.560]   that it really impacts our entire health of our body.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.880]   Like so much so that when I had the doctor on the Ask the Doctor immune health edition,
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.240]   I said, what's one thing we can do that will support our immune system?
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.920]   She was like, take care of your mouth because it's impacting your immune system.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.040]   It's impacting your cardiovascular health.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.720]   It's impacting your brain health, like literally your mouth.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   Microbiome is where all of these things are starting.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:11.960]   And fluoride, we're finding out more and more has these really negative impacts
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.160]   on our overall health.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.720]   So you want all the benefits.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.520]   It's good for teeth. Nobody's disputing that.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.040]   Everybody's like fluoride. Great for teeth. We love it.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.480]   Maybe not so much for our overall health.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.960]   So if we want the benefits of fluoride for our teeth
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.320]   without having the negative elements of fluoride for our health,
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.360]   hydroxyapatite is a fluoride alternative.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.960]   It's been used in Japan for 30 years now.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.760]   It's very safe.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.040]   It's literally as effective or more effective than fluoride.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.480]   And tons of studies.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.320]   You can find it in a toothpaste called Risewell, a toothpaste called Boca.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.480]   There's actually a normal toothpaste that you can buy online
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.320]   and you're getting all of the mouth benefits while protecting your mouth
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.840]   microbiome and protecting the more downstream effects of fluoride in your body.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.000]   So hydroxyapatite toothpaste, I'd say in a larger way,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.360]   making little swaps to the things that you use every single day.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.200]   So that's another people are like, Oh, do I have to like wear organic clothes
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.680]   and do all this stuff?
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.080]   And I'm like, make over your bed.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.760]   You're going to spend 12 hours.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.160]   Well, you're going to spend eight hours a day in your bed.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.120]   And if you can make your bed this little wellness haven,
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.000]   then you can skip a lot of the other stuff.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.080]   So if you can get a mattress that's not off gassing, if you can get
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.600]   I have organic sheets, I have a hypoallergenic pillow, things like that.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   I have a silk pillowcase so that my hair and my skin looks really good.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.960]   I tape my mouth at night to sleep.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.800]   I think there's all of these things that you can do while you're sleeping
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.280]   to essentially enhance your wellness that you're not like
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.480]   having to think about during the day.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.640]   So that was a lot of things.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.040]   What is taping your mouth?
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.000]   Taping your mouth is the idea that essentially when you're
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.800]   breathing through your nose, you're getting a lot more health
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.880]   benefits for your body than when you're breathing through your mouth.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.200]   And I feel very strongly about this.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.720]   I actually had a reconstructive rhinoplasty in October.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.280]   I went surfing one time in my whole life and I broke my nose.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:10.120]   I hit myself in the face with the surfboard in Brazil, and I got it fixed
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.720]   after that and after they fixed it, I couldn't breathe through my nose.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.160]   And the effects of not being able to breathe through your nose
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.160]   are so well researched and so much worse than what we think.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.880]   For instance, my really severe anxiety
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.600]   started pretty closely with the time that I stopped
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.800]   being able to breathe through my nose.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:31.400]   And I'm not saying it's just that, because obviously there's so many factors
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.880]   in one's life that you have to consider with something like anxiety.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:38.080]   But I also don't think that it's completely separate or completely unrelated.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.880]   So we want to breathe through our nose as much as possible.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.600]   It decreases stress.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.240]   It takes your body out of this like fight or flight mode.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.320]   It helps you think better.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.400]   It helps eliminate that foggy brain situation.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.480]   It's just generally so good for us.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.240]   But many of us have trained ourselves to breathe through our mouths all the time.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.560]   If you have a nose that can have air go through it, which I do now
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.240]   because I had a piece of my rib taken and they built out my nose.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.000]   So it's like bigger and has passageways that are wide enough for air now.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.800]   So you have a nose that can have air go through it.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.200]   A nice practice to do is to gently tape your mouth
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.120]   and then it forces you to breathe through your nose.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.920]   So it's not a physical issue.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   It's more of a habitual issue that you're trying to correct.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.520]   And if you're worried about it, if you're about suffocating,
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.960]   there's mouth tapes that you can get online
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.080]   that very much allow you to breathe through your mouth.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.720]   They just encourage you to breathe through your nose
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.760]   to experience all those positive effects.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.040]   And you do this every night?
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   I do it most nights. Yeah. Wow.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.960]   It also helps with snoring.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.440]   Again, if we're going from a vanity perspective,
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.040]   a lot of people have like weaker chins.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.640]   You'll start to see a difference in that
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.600]   if you start breathing through your nose, because it literally reshapes your jaw.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.400]   In essence, it'll help with your teeth health,
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.800]   because when you're breathing through your mouth overnight,
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.880]   your mouth is drying out and you want to keep all that saliva in there
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.480]   because that's the thing that's essentially protecting your enamel.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.000]   It'll help with your teeth health, which will, again,
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.800]   have all those downstream positive effects
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.360]   because of your oral microbiome taking care of that.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.480]   Your breath won't smell as bad in the morning.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.400]   Not you. I don't mean to point to you.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.200]   Wow. I'm sitting here.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   I'm like, we're only five feet away and it's afternoon.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.600]   But wow. OK, so so much of what we do nowadays,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.440]   especially I think about me and work and living at home during the pandemic.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.200]   Everything's online. Everything's virtual.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.160]   When you came here today, you gave me a physical product,
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.480]   which I thought was so cool.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.360]   And it immediately made me jealous because I was like, gosh, I have a podcast.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.240]   I've always listeners. I don't have a physical product.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.680]   I wish I could have something to give people yet.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.040]   So I need to get inspired there.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.000]   If anyone has ideas, let me know.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.080]   But can you talk about the deck of cards you gave me?
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.800]   Yeah. So it's the healthier together deck.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.320]   I'm allergic to boring conversation.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.360]   I am also extroverted, introvert and introverted extrovert.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.520]   So I want to be around people and I want to have the conversations.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.680]   But sometimes I think there's a lot of pressure into taking it to those deep
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.200]   levels. You kind of stay in the like, well, how are you?
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.920]   What's going on in your life?
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.960]   What are the world events when actually we really want to talk about
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   like those foundational things, like the things that make us the people that we are.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.880]   So I wanted to create a deck that basically gives you an excuse
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.520]   to have all the types of conversations that we want to be having
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.080]   that maybe are harder to bring into our everyday lives.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.760]   I actually think it's a huge reason why people love podcasts is because
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.920]   I just met you, but we're getting to have these sort of like deeper,
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.560]   more introspective conversations simply because there's a mic in front of us.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.920]   So what I like to say about the deck is it lets you get a lot of the benefits
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.960]   of doing something like a podcast.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.480]   It lets us bring the questions of something like a podcast into your kitchen table.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.920]   So I recommend having one in your car.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.560]   I made it really pretty so you can like leave it out on your coffee table,
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.720]   leave it out in your kitchen table,
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.640]   and then you can just pull out a card anytime with a friend,
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.000]   with your partner, with like your mom and dad on a Zoom date.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.400]   Instead of you're just like, OK, we like talked about Aunt Sally last week.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.800]   That's so great. I'm glad your golf game is good.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.760]   You can pull out a card and really get to know people as people.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.120]   And people will surprise you.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.840]   My husband surprises me with his answers all of the time,
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.680]   and it makes me feel closer to him and more connected to him
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.600]   and love him so much more.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.080]   I love it. Funny enough, when we had our au pair first arrive,
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.360]   the au pair agency sent us a deck of cards with questions.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.040]   Oh, my God, to try to get to know each other and your family.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   Oh, my God, that's so fun.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.120]   The weird thing was that we're good.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.480]   Some of them were good.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.920]   The strangest thing was some of them are labeled.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.640]   This is an au pair only question, and this is a host family only question.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.000]   And you would think they would be things like,
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.560]   what is it like growing up in America?
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.000]   But some of them were strange,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.360]   whereas like the host family no au pair question is what does happiness mean?
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.280]   And it's like, why is this a specific question?
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   Why couldn't we all discuss it?
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.520]   Yeah, that's so interesting.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.400]   But I really like that.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.800]   But we've tapped it out.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.240]   It's not as big of a deck as this.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.920]   So I'm excited for this.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.040]   The card I pulled out somewhat randomly that I'll share
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.960]   as an example of a conversation starter is, have you been anywhere in the world
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.400]   where you've thought the people here really got it right
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.680]   in terms of living a happy or healthier life?
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.120]   If so, where was it?
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.320]   Yeah, so that's one of the questions that actually came directly out of my podcast.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.800]   So I like to ask people that at the end of episodes,
