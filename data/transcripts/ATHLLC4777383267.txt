[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.000]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.400]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.880]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here for a conversation with Liz
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.280]   Moody.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840]   Liz is a longtime writer, editor, and healthy recipe developer.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.320]   She's the author of two cookbooks, Healthier Together and Glow Pops.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.720]   She was formerly the food director for MindBodyGreen, and she's had her work
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.280]   featured in Vogue, Women's Health, and many more places.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.920]   And last, but certainly not least, she's the host of the hit wellness podcast,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.560]   Healthier Together, which features intimate interviews with some of the
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.200]   biggest names in the wellness world, as well as a few non-wellness guests like
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.160]   yours truly.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.040]   In fact, the episode I did on her show just went live today as well.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.200]   And in case you aren't watching on YouTube, we recorded both those episodes
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.000]   live from the All The Hacks studio, aka my basement.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.560]   This conversation is going to be chocked full of all kinds of health and wellness
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.040]   hacks.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.880]   But if you hear that and think it might be too healthy for you, then you should
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.120]   definitely stick around because I happen to know we both share a fondness for a
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800]   certain unhealthy cereal.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.680]   And that while Liz certainly believes in the power of food to heal and nourish
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.600]   your body, she also knows that a good pasta carbonara has a place on the table
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.360]   because sometimes it can just heal your soul.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.280]   We're here to talk spices, cold showers, circadian walks, meditation, vitamins,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.160]   taping your mouth at night, hacks to make frozen veggies taste great, and a lot
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.560]   more.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.160]   That is a lot to cover.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.280]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.440]   Liz, thanks for being here.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.320]   Thanks for having me in your house.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.120]   This feels very like intimate and fun.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.640]   I know.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.680]   I have done almost all virtual recordings online and then two this week in person.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.040]   It feels like the new normal.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.600]   Oh, I'm so happy with it.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.920]   So I'm going to start by letting you know that I too love Fruity Pebbles.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.280]   That is not where I thought you would start.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.920]   Is it your cereal of choice?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.200]   I wouldn't go as far as cereal of choice, but it's definitely in like the top two
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.880]   or three.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   I only say not of choice because like, it's not a healthy cereal.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   It's not a natural cereal.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.520]   I thought the colors were like, they always say eat the rainbow.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.200]   Is that not?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.080]   No, that's Skittles.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.400]   Also not natural, but people are not going to listen to any of my health advice from
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.920]   this moment.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.160]   Well, actually, I think the opposite, because so often I feel like you're talking
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.520]   to people who have an opinion about health and ways to eat healthier and live
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.560]   healthier and be healthier.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.360]   And you get all of this feedback that is like, you can't do anything fun.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.480]   And so I wanted to start with that because when I was reading part of your
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.160]   cookbook, and I was just reading some of the content you wrote, I listened to some
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.720]   of your podcasts.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.200]   There is a lot of advice on how you can live and happier, healthier life.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.600]   Yes.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.640]   But I also heard that you love Fruity Pebbles, which makes me feel like you're a
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.440]   normal person.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.880]   And you're not someone who's just like figured out how to never eat anything
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.720]   unhealthy, which I just is not an option in my world.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.440]   I like cinnamon rolls.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.200]   I like donuts.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.160]   I like Fruity Pebbles.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.920]   Do I want to eat them in moderation?
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.640]   Do I want to use hacks to make it better?
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.680]   Yes, but I want to at least set the ground with talking about food first, that you
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.480]   are not this rare person that just doesn't like sweet food.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.360]   And that's how you're healthy.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.520]   No, I absolutely love sweet food.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.280]   So I always say that wellness is a tool, not an end unto itself.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.440]   So the second that wellness makes your life worse, it's no longer wellness.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.560]   And I think a lot of people are like, Oh, I'm like living this really healthy life,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.000]   but they're miserable all of the time with all of the things that they're doing to be
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.080]   quote unquote healthy and healthy includes how we feel in our body, but also how we
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.040]   feel in our brain.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.080]   So if you're like, I can't go out to dinner with my friends.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.040]   Cause what am I going to eat?
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.760]   I can't ever eat these like foods that really make me smile and bring me joy.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.360]   That's not wellness.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.200]   Wellness is actually getting in the way of you living your best life.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.880]   So I always like people to zoom out and have that perspective with wellness and
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.960]   with any of the health tools that I provide my audience with.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.760]   I'm like, sometimes I'll say, Oh, here's my nighttime routine.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.680]   And people be like, well, what if I am out late drinking with my friends or I'm at a
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.040]   work party and I can't do it.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.880]   And I'm like, then don't do it.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.200]   If you can't do it, don't do it.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.600]   It's also all designed to help us get optimal sleep.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.920]   So if you're super tired and you're just going to fall asleep anyways, good fall
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.360]   asleep.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.600]   That's amazing.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.120]   On top of that, I think there are also a lot of things that you can do to make the
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.200]   things that feel a little bit more fun, a little bit more indulgent, not feel as
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   negative on your body.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.560]   So let's take sugar, for example, when I was writing my cookbook, I drove my editor
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.280]   crazy with this because I was like, for everything, I wanted to have like my very
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.880]   specific perspective and why I was making the assertion that thing was healthy.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.560]   And for dessert, I was like, what is quote unquote unhealthy about dessert?
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.960]   And the main thing is, is that it spikes your blood sugar.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.840]   So you're having a lot of sugar, your blood sugar goes up and then it'll crash
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.200]   down.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.760]   You'll feel lethargic.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   We've all had that sort of like tired.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.560]   Sometimes you get like a little shaky.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.920]   You just don't feel good when your blood sugar rises and then crashes.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.200]   So that's the problem.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.640]   What can we do to solve that?
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.920]   There's a few things we can do.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.680]   One, you can change the format of the dessert itself.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.120]   So I do that by adding fat fiber protein to my desserts.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.160]   I'll put in something like Greek yogurt or almond butter or almond flour and just
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.280]   make it a more stable blood sugar experience from the get go.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   But then there's also other fun things you can do too.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.200]   So I had a woman who calls herself the glucose goddess on my podcast.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.640]   She is amazing.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.960]   She's a biochemist who kind of hacks glucose in her body.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.720]   She wears a continuous glucose monitor and she, her whole thing is studying the
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.520]   different effects that things have on your glucose.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.080]   So she has a few different like little tricks that she recommends that I really
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.440]   like.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.360]   One is if you want to eat a sweet thing like fruity pebbles, we all love our
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.880]   fruity pebbles.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.440]   And I honestly think fruity pebbles like got me through the pandemic.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   I'm like, not sure.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.760]   I was in New York for the early parts of it.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.240]   And I am like, if I didn't have my fruity pebbles, would I be okay right now
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.760]   mentally?
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.480]   And I don't think so.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.360]   But if you want something like your fruity pebbles, don't have it as a snack,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.160]   have it as an actual dessert, which means after you consume some other type of
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.760]   form of food.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.840]   So after you've had a main course with your protein, with your fat, your fiber,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.800]   all of that.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.880]   So if you're craving a cookie in the middle of the day, if you're craving your
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.280]   fruity pebbles, be like, that's not off limits to me.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.520]   I'm still going to have it, but I'm going to move it to after a meal.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.880]   That's a really great hack.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.160]   That'll just elongate your blood sugar curve and make sure that your glucose
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.200]   doesn't spike and crash again, eliminating all of those quote unquote negative
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.840]   effects in your body of eating a lot of sugar.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.160]   Another one that I really liked is her green starter hack, which is just eat
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.440]   something green before you eat anything else.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.240]   So if you eat something with a lot of fiber, it creates almost like a little
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   stopper in your intestines and it just slows the absorption of everything else
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:27.720]   in your body.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.280]   So literally you can do this for anything that you eat.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.320]   Just eat a little green salad before some vegetables.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.480]   If you're out at a restaurant before you go for the bread, which is a lot of
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.400]   carbs, a lot of stuff that would spike your blood sugar, have a little vegetable
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.080]   side first, have a little salad first.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.040]   You can do that with literally anything.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.920]   And that brings me to my last point, which is that I think if we think of
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.360]   wellness as deprivation based, it's not going to stick again.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.040]   It feels like it's making our life worse.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.920]   So with every single part of health, I like to think about what I can add to my
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.560]   life instead of what I can take away.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.960]   So instead of being like, I'm not going to eat any sugar and that's going to
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.200]   make me feel so much better, you think about, I'm going to add a vegetable to
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.680]   every single meal and I'm not going to take anything away.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.960]   And I think if we start to think about what can we add to our lives, we start to
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.160]   feel nourished.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.000]   We start to feel taken care of and we start to feel like these things are making
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.400]   our life better instead of being dogmatic and taking away from our experience on
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:24.880]   this planet.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.000]   So is that as simple as I want to order pizza tonight, but I'm just going to like
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.120]   whip up some broccoli and eat that alongside?
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.880]   A hundred percent.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.840]   So my husband and I eat frozen pizza like quite often for dinner and we'll just
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.880]   make a little salad that we'll eat.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.320]   So we'll get like one of those containers of pre-washed greens.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.920]   We'll put some olive oil.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.840]   I like to like microplane a little bit of garlic, a little bit of a lemon zest and
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.760]   then squeeze the lemon juice and some salt.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   And we'll eat that first.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.680]   So the thing is you eat the green thing first or we keep frozen broccoli on hand.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.520]   I love roasting frozen vegetables.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.160]   Have you ever tried that?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.000]   No, but I know from looking you up, it's like you said roasting frozen vegetables.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   And I was like, gosh, most people you talk to that have written a cookbook are like
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   the only vegetable you should eat is like fresh from the farmer's market.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.040]   No, no, no.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.880]   I mean, I love the farmer's market.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.480]   It's like very much my happy place.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.600]   And I think it's a wonderful way to get excited about food.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.560]   It feels like a very visceral experience.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.440]   You can walk around and like sample things and it feels beautiful.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.240]   And I think anything that gets you excited about healthy eating is wonderful.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.200]   But frozen vegetables and frozen fruits are phenomenal.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   They often contain more nutrients than their fresh counterparts because
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.160]   they're flash frozen at peak ripeness.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.200]   So if you pick broccoli, every bit of its journey from being picked to the grocery
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.640]   store, it's going to go in a truck.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.120]   It might cross the country.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.360]   It might cross several countries to get to you.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.800]   And then it's going to sit on the grocery store shelf for often quite a while before
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.120]   we're actually purchasing it.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.000]   And every little bit of that way, it's losing its nutrients.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.360]   So things like vitamin C especially are really quick to be lost in that journey.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   Whereas if you are getting something flash frozen, it's
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.960]   preserving a lot more of those nutrients.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.760]   So I think we should eat fresh vegetables and fresh fruits as much as we possibly can.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.520]   But I also think that frozen fruits and veggies can be a really
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.000]   beautiful part of the journey.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.600]   And my frozen veggie roasting hack is like one of my absolute favorites.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.680]   So the thing that you do is you put your frozen veggies, like frozen broccoli,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.240]   let's say out on some parchment paper, and then you put it in the oven at like
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.880]   425 or something like that, but with nothing on it.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.800]   I learned this when I was trying all these different ways to roast chickpeas and make
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.920]   them super, super crispy for my cookbook.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.920]   And people were like, Oh, do it with oil at this point, or you should start
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.080]   with fresh chickpeas or whatever.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.280]   And the thing I found that worked the best is you roast them completely
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.920]   dry, no oil, because the oil traps in the moisture.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.320]   So you want all of that moisture to evaporate.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.120]   And then you add the oil and then you cook them normally.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.360]   So with the broccoli, you want to like literally not touch it, like dump the bag
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.800]   on the parchment paper, spread it out, put it in the oven, and then roast it until
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.680]   all of that moisture's evaporated.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.400]   It's already starting to brown a little bit.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.040]   And then you toss it with the oil, toss it with some salt, toss it with
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   whatever seasonings you want, cook it for five more minutes, and you've got like
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   beautiful frozen roasted broccoli.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.080]   Are there other vegetables it works with?
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.600]   Definitely anything cruciferous.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.360]   So like cauliflower, it works pretty well with Brussels sprouts.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.600]   You're not going to get quite the same effect as you would with like a fresh
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.960]   Brussels sprout, definitely like squash and things like that, that
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.320]   are chopped and pre-prepared.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.360]   Awesome.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.760]   You mentioned adding veggies and you mentioned how to do it if they're frozen.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.040]   Are there other good tips for how to take what you do now and make it better?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.480]   And there's like a zillion.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.200]   So if we're in the, if we're in the realm of like still frozen veggies,
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   which I'm really into, one of my favorite hacks is to keep a bag of
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.480]   cauliflower rice in your freezer, and you can buy this at any grocery store,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   just like pre-prepared cauliflower rice.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.160]   It's just going to be riced cauliflower.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.280]   And then you can use that as a sub for ground beef and pretty much any recipe.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.440]   Like I do half ground beef and then half the cauliflower rice.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.360]   So like a bolognese, you can brown the ground beef and then add the cauliflower
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.720]   rice in, and you won't know that it's there, but you've just added this like
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.080]   significant portion of vegetables to your dish.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.720]   I also think that cauliflower rice is amazing for thickening soups.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.840]   If you're making a soup and it doesn't have as much body,
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.960]   it doesn't have as much heft.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.160]   You can take half the soup and then blend it with some sauteed cauliflower rice,
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.480]   and then pour that back in.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.720]   And you'll have this really thick and beautiful and rich soup.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   So I think that keeping some frozen cauliflower rice on hand at all
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   times is a really wonderful hack.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.360]   I also love to sub it.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.120]   Like I'll put it in for half of my white rice in a dish.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.520]   So I'll cook up some white rice, delicious, lots of salt.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.800]   That's the secret to making white rice taste really good.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   But then I'll saute up some cauliflower rice and I'll just mix them together.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.480]   I'm not a person who can do cauliflower rice on its own and pretend that it's
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.720]   rice because it's not, and it doesn't taste good.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.440]   And I need my food to taste good.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.480]   And that is like my number one rule of food is that it needs to taste good.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.680]   But mixed in with normal rice, it actually adds like a really nice nutty note.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.440]   And I think enhances the dish and adds veggies
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.480]   instead of detracting from it in any way.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.200]   I'm going to ask what else?
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.280]   Because frozen cauliflower rice, frozen broccoli, both good hacks.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.520]   Yeah. So I would say a few things.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.080]   One, use your spices way, way, way more spices.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.880]   I always call them the original superfood.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.360]   So people are always trying to like go get these like fancy superfood powders
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.960]   and add them to their lives and enhance their health journey that way.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.360]   And that's great if that's what you want to do. Wonderful.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   But spices have so many potent therapeutic properties
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.800]   and they make everything you eat taste really delicious.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.840]   If there's spices listed in a recipe, I almost always pretty much double them.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.320]   Like obviously do it to taste, but people way under season their food
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.760]   and it makes it healthier and it makes it tastier.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.120]   So big fan of that.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.920]   Also a big fan of starting every single morning with a green smoothie,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.000]   which I would be remiss not to mention.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.520]   I'm sort of like known for my green smoothies, both in my personal life
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.520]   when I push them on people at all times.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.480]   I have a video on my Instagram where I was testing out different green smoothies
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.200]   until I won over my little sister who hated green smoothies.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.560]   And I did.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.360]   I got her with a pina colada one, which I was very proud of.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.640]   And she liked it.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.800]   And she drinks green smoothies every single morning now,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.000]   which I'm very proud of.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.440]   But also in my public life,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.720]   I have a Green Smoothie Society on Patreon at Patreon.com/lizmoody,
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.240]   which just has all of these green smoothie recipes.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.200]   I think it's a really beautiful thing you can integrate into your day.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.440]   It tastes like a milkshake.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   It takes less than five minutes to make.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.480]   And if you do it in the morning, for instance,
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.920]   you will have had more vegetables before like nine a.m.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.240]   than most people eat in an entire day, which just makes you feel really good
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.000]   about yourself.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.600]   So I'm a big fan of the all in greens.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.680]   What's in these green smoothies?
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.520]   OK, so the formula is greens and you can do like spinach.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.000]   You can do mixed greens.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.480]   You can do something like arugula, but you need to balance it
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.560]   with, I would say, something that's a little peppery that leans into those notes.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.200]   But I'd say for a starter, spinach or mixed greens is a really nice base.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   And then on top of that, you're going to do a banana, I would say,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.640]   will make it taste really good.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.800]   You're not going to taste the banana.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.440]   But if you're just going for a delicious flavor, put the banana in there.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   I have some recipes without if you're banana free, but good starter.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.360]   And then you want some sort of fat.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   So that can be an avocado.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.680]   That can be Greek yogurt.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.120]   That can be a nut or a seed.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.480]   I think like pistachio is a really fun thing to include in a smoothie.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.800]   That can be chia seeds.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.720]   That can be flax seeds.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   That can be hemp seeds.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.160]   That can be a nut butter, but some sort of nut or some sort of fat
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.320]   to get the nutrient absorption from the vegetables that you're putting in.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.600]   So something like greens has a lot of fat soluble vitamins in them.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.280]   And you want to make sure
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.480]   that you're actually absorbing all of those vitamins from those greens.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.680]   So some sort of fat.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.640]   And that's also going to help you stay full through lunch, which is what we want.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.080]   That said, if your green smoothie does not make you full, please eat some food.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.520]   That's very important to me.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.720]   This is not meant to be a diet thing.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.960]   This is, again, not meant to be restrictive in any way, shape or form.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   If you're hungry, listen to your body, eat.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.000]   A lot of people will do green smoothie with a scrambled egg on the side
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.960]   or something like that.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.840]   I switch it up.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.160]   Some days the green smoothie is enough.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.240]   Some days I like to have a more robust breakfast.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   So I go either way.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.120]   So we've got our greens, our banana, our fat, and then you want to add some protein.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.280]   So if you're using some nuts or seeds, they're going to have a certain amount
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.160]   of protein.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.800]   You can also add in something like a protein powder.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.240]   You can add in collagen.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.400]   Again, that protein is going to elongate your blood sugar curve
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.880]   and it's going to keep you full longer.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.440]   So that's really important.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.480]   I like to add some frozen berries, usually like blueberries
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.040]   or blackberries or strawberries.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.240]   And then I like to put in like my fun flavor element.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   So this can be spices.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.200]   I love cinnamon in smoothies.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.640]   I love cardamom in smoothies.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.760]   I love cayenne is like a little bit of spice in a smoothie.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.840]   I love cacao, which just makes it taste like chocolate,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.720]   which is the dream and everything.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.960]   I also love zest, so using like some lemon zest or some orange zest.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.760]   It has so many therapeutic properties, the skin of the citrus,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.200]   but it also tastes really strongly of that thing.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.760]   So if you put like orange juice in your smoothie,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.960]   putting orange zest in the smoothie will taste even more orangey essentially,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.120]   which is really nice.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.520]   And then a little pinch of sea salt, which is just going to bring out
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.480]   all of those flavors.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.400]   You always want a little bit of salt in anything that you cook,
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.800]   even if it's a sweet thing.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.840]   We put salt in our cookies, it brings out those flavors
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.000]   and it also adds some minerals if you're using a sea salt
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.720]   or a mineral salt or something like that.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.840]   And then I just add water.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.160]   I think that blending your smoothies with a nut milk
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.640]   is a huge waste of money.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.680]   Like what are we looking for?
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.040]   Save your nut milk for your fruity pebbles
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.360]   and use water in your smoothies, blend it up and drink it.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.000]   And then they also keep for, I'd say 24 hours solidly
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.800]   in a tightly sealed container in the fridge.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.480]   So if you want to make a smoothie for two days,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.400]   which I love doing a little gift from past you,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.760]   highly recommend that as well.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.600]   - I love it.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.560]   I want to go back to your previous comment on spices
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.240]   and ask, do you replace your spices regularly?
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.200]   I always wonder if this spice rack that I assume
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.640]   we probably bought 15 years ago or something is,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.680]   have they expired?
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.760]   Do they go bad?
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.400]   - They don't go bad per se.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.000]   Like you're not probably going to get food poisoning
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   or something like that from your spices,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.160]   but they will lose their potency in terms of both flavor
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.240]   and therapeutic benefits.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.160]   If you want to know if your spice is still giving you
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.360]   all those therapeutic benefits,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.720]   you can literally just taste it.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.160]   And if it doesn't taste robust and of that thing,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.720]   then you've probably lost a fair amount
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   of the therapeutic benefits.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.680]   So there's a few things you can do to prevent that.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.440]   You want to keep your spices somewhere as cold
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.560]   and dark and dry as possible.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.680]   So in a cabinet, not right next to your stove,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.400]   not lined up on your wall where the sun is coming in
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.240]   every single day, just as cold and dark and dry as possible.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.800]   And that will make them last longer.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.760]   And then seal them as well as possible.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.720]   And then use them more.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.840]   It's a little bit tricky because I feel like
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.160]   by having them put away,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.400]   you're maybe not as inspired to use them.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.360]   So take inventory regularly, put them in your dishes
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.000]   so that they're not dying before you get the chance
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.840]   to use them.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.080]   - And how long would you say the average spice lasts?
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.720]   - I'd say like a year.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.760]   - So would you do like a turnover of your whole spice?
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.320]   - I don't because I use them all.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.680]   - I would say most of the spices in our spice drawer
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.800]   that we don't use a lot of are like five plus years old.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.200]   So maybe before you leave, since we're in person.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.040]   - Yeah, I'll go through.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.880]   - Give me a little spice inventory.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.520]   - Well, and I would also say that I don't think you need
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.680]   maybe as many spices as you think.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.440]   So sometimes people go and they try to do like
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   this fully stocked spice rack, but then they realize
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.800]   they're really just using the same five or six spices
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.080]   on a regular basis.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.320]   And maybe lean into those spices.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.040]   And if a recipe has like 45 spices, be like,
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.200]   do I really need all of these?
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.520]   Can I experiment with getting most of the way there
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.680]   with what I have?
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.840]   I also think that spice blends are super underutilized.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.200]   So instead of buying all of the spices in something,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.040]   have one or two go-to spice blends
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.240]   that you're always using.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.120]   If you wanna like roast vegetables
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.160]   and have it taste really good.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.080]   If you're doing a stir fry
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.440]   and you wanna have it taste really good,
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.000]   you have your spice blends that you can go through with that
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.240]   and that way you can use it up much more quickly.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.080]   - I love it.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.320]   Now I'm getting hungry and we don't have dinner plans
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.440]   at this house tonight.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.000]   So I'm curious, pick a recipe from your cookbook
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.280]   that I and anyone listening can make for a meal tonight
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.960]   that you think will just make everyone happy.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.800]   - Ooh.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.000]   Okay.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.880]   - That I can also link to so people can try it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.600]   I'm trying to think.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.080]   Yeah, so this isn't up yet,
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.040]   but it will be up by the time that this goes up.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's a taco salad.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.760]   I like salad, but the salad has to take like really,
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.840]   really, really good if I'm gonna eat salad.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.200]   And so I'm a big fan of like hearty salads
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.120]   and exciting salads and things like that.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.360]   And I had a taco salad out at a restaurant
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.440]   in the Bay Area and I was deeply disappointed by it.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.200]   And I was just like, this could be so much better.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.040]   So this is just a very quick and easy taco salad.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   The taco meat is plant-based, not because I am plant-based,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.440]   but because I thought it actually tasted better that way.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.560]   So I call it accidentally plant-based.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.840]   It's a mix of pecans and frozen cauliflower rice.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.040]   So you can pull out your frozen cauliflower rice
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.120]   and make that with that.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.480]   And then it's just quickly seasoned
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.600]   and then everything else you're just like chopping up
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.640]   and you're making a really quick jalapeno dressing,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.880]   which I love and pouring it over the top.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's gonna be really nourishing.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.240]   It's gonna be really delicious
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.680]   and it's gonna make you feel really,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.280]   really good after you eat it.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.160]   - All right, we will link to that in the show notes.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.000]   - Yes.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.480]   - I noticed looking at the cookbook,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.840]   gluten-free, dairy-free and plant-centered.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.880]   Is that because you are gluten-free and dairy-free
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.160]   or is that 'cause you feel like that's a healthier way
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.000]   to live or how did you make that call?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.680]   - So for a few reasons,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.160]   if I'm gonna be completely honest,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.200]   it's because the powers that be at publishing houses
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   like marketing terms and so those are easy marketing terms
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   that help people identify it's, and I get it.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.320]   You know, if you're looking at a cookbook cover on Amazon,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.360]   you need to be able to tell so quickly
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.280]   whether that's something that you're gonna want
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.120]   in your life.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.360]   So identifying terms like that are really, really important.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.040]   Also, I'm trying to make my food as accessible
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.400]   to as many people as possible
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.360]   and there definitely are people out there
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.640]   with celiac disease, with allergies and things like that.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.880]   - So the book says plant-centered.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.200]   What's the take on plants?
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.520]   - I would say plant-forward, 100%.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   I am trying to smoosh in vegetables whenever possible.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.280]   I'm the biggest fan of them.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520]   I've interviewed probably thousands of doctors
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.680]   at this point in my life and it's so interesting
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.880]   because they disagree about so many things
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.800]   about what constitutes a healthy diet.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.720]   But the one thing they all agree on
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.880]   is that like more vegetables is better.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.440]   80% or so of your diet should just be like focusing
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.840]   on putting vegetables in.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.680]   So I'm like, let's stop arguing over that last little bit
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.080]   about whether like meat or no meat or grains or no grains.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.440]   If we all just got the vegetable part right,
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.480]   we would all feel so much better.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.600]   We're arguing about that tiny, tweaky bit
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.160]   when we don't have the foundation laid.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.160]   And I think that happens with a lot of wellness stuff.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.160]   We're trying to like hyper-optimize
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.440]   instead of laying the foundation
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.680]   that would actually make the difference.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.080]   So I would say plant-forward, 100%.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.520]   Vegetables are the foundation.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.160]   I'm gonna smush them in anywhere.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.920]   But I don't follow any food rules with my diet.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.120]   And I think unless you have a specific health reason,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.640]   something like celiac disease or an allergy
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.520]   or something like that, I would not encourage anybody
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.800]   to follow any restrictive rules either.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.640]   - Perfect.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.720]   And for all those vegetables,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.880]   do you feel like vegetables, fruits, anything,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.160]   do they all need to be organic?
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.680]   Or what's your stance on organic food?
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.560]   - So look, I think that we all do the best that we can
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.960]   within the circumstances that we have.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.840]   The reasons to buy organic are a few.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.800]   Like obviously there's pesticides
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.400]   and things that you maybe don't want in your body.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.960]   And then I think you can follow easily
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.160]   something like the Clean 15 and the Dirty Dozen,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.720]   which you can easily look up online.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.120]   And that's basically a list of produce
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.040]   that is gonna be more likely to be sprayed with pesticides
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.120]   or things that you'd put in your body.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.440]   You can also follow easy rules like bananas, avocados,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.080]   things that you're not eating the skin.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.400]   You probably don't need to spend your money on organic.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.800]   But then there's also issues
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.440]   with a lot of organic farming practices
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.040]   where they're using heavy metals
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.080]   and other things that you maybe don't want
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.920]   in your body as well.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.320]   So I think that it's complicated and it's nuanced
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.280]   and the best way to get around it
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.320]   is by knowing your farmer as much as possible.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.560]   And obviously that's a very privileged thing to do.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.280]   But I do think if you can go to a farmer's market
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.080]   and ask how they're farming,
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.640]   what they're using when they're growing,
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.480]   that's the absolute best practice.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.180]   And then beyond that, I would say in general, roughly,
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.400]   if you can afford to buy organic,
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.720]   do it for things that you are eating the skin of.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.640]   Like when I was talking about the zesting,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.120]   if you can get that organic, great, that's really nice.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.980]   And if you can't, then don't sweat it.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.960]   There is never a circumstance in which it's worse for you
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.320]   to be eating the produce.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.000]   If you're like, "Oh, I can't afford organic produce.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.840]   "Should I be buying produce?"
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.680]   Yes, 100%, it's still the best thing
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.480]   you should be putting into your body.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.720]   - Do you feel similarly about meats?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.960]   - I think meats are a little bit trickier.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.120]   For me, I would say that I lean towards grass-fed,
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.560]   pasture-raised, ethical practices.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   I'm also a borderline meat eater as is
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.840]   for ethical reasons and environmental reasons.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.000]   So if I'm gonna eat meat,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.920]   I really want it to have been raised
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.680]   in as ethical a way as possible.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.420]   I think because we're talking about a living creature,
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.560]   it's a little bit different
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.520]   than when we're talking about a carrot.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.320]   - Well, you haven't mentioned anything about supplements,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.880]   vitamins, that kind of stuff.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.280]   Do those have a role in a healthy lifestyle?
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.120]   - I think they absolutely can and do,
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.540]   but I think it depends what your goals are.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.920]   I hate when you open somebody's supplement cabinet
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.520]   and they have so many of them,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.600]   and you're like, "Well, what are these for?"
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.560]   And they're like, "I don't know.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.320]   "It's part of being healthy."
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.840]   And I think you should be able to point
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.100]   to every single supplement that you are taking
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.360]   and say, "This is the need that it's filling.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.000]   "This is the problem that it's solving."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.760]   So for me, for instance, I don't eat seafood at all.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.840]   I take fish oil.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.120]   I know that having omega-3s in my diet
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.700]   is really good for my brain.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.520]   It's really good for my overall health,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.400]   so that is why I take my fish oil supplement.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.800]   I think that if you're willy-nilly attacking it
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.160]   and taking too many,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.000]   you're probably not having the positive effects
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.840]   that you want.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.620]   You're probably wasting a lot of money,
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.280]   and it should be a lot more of a thoughtful practice
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.920]   than people are using it for.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.440]   - Is that the same with a daily vitamin?
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.080]   We were talking about this off-air a little bit.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.420]   I take athletic grains.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.000]   I love athletic grains.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.800]   I think that something like a daily vitamin,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.440]   particularly if it's a vitamin like athletic grains
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.540]   that's sourced in a whole food form,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.440]   it's a really nice nutritional insurance.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.080]   So a lot of us would like to eat a lot better
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.920]   than we are eating,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.800]   or we don't have time to make these robust,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.000]   veggie-rich meals,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.960]   and also there is some truth to the fact
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.440]   that produce doesn't necessarily
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.140]   have the same nutrient profile
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.720]   that it would have at one point.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.160]   The soil has been really depleted
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.960]   through farming practices, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.380]   So I think that it's a nice practice
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.400]   to have a little bit of insurance,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.000]   but again, it's a nice to have,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.920]   and if all you can afford is really good produce, do that.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.480]   Your number one thing I want you spending money on
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.240]   is really good produce.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.640]   If you can fill your diet with vegetables,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.240]   you will feel better than almost any other practice
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.080]   that you can add in.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.800]   And then everything else, it's bonuses.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.240]   It's a little bit of a cherry on top.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.480]   So stack your sundae.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.360]   Again, lay those foundations,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.960]   and then if you want to add the cherry on top of that,
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.920]   all the better.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.640]   - And when you say really good produce,
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.160]   do you mean fresh?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.720]   What's the really good?
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.280]   - So I mean like a diverse, beautiful array of produce.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.360]   Something that gets lost in the produce conversation often,
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.740]   and in the healthy eating conversation,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.200]   is how much diversity is important to our health.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.240]   So I've interviewed a number of gut health experts,
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.960]   and people are always like looking
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.640]   for these little gut health hacks,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.120]   and it really comes down to eat as many types of plants
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.560]   as you possibly can on as regular of a basis as you can.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.960]   So if you're regularly eating broccoli,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.560]   maybe try Brussels sprouts, maybe try cauliflower.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.740]   If you're making your smoothie with spinach all the time,
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.600]   maybe swap in some mixed greens.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.960]   If you have pretty much any dish,
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.480]   add some fresh herbs on top.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.980]   That's a type of produce,
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.720]   and it's gonna make it taste better.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.660]   It's gonna make it look more visually appealing.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.440]   So just as large of a variety as possible,
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.840]   as much diversity as possible.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.000]   It's gonna feed your gut microbiome.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.820]   You're gonna be really happy.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.040]   - It sounds great.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.000]   One of our favorite things to do,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.400]   and I can put a link in the show notes,
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   but you don't need it,
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.240]   is to literally go to the farmer's market
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.840]   and just buy all the vegetables
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.440]   and make a crazy big stir fry with just all vegetables.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.280]   - I love that.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.040]   - There's probably 10 or 12 vegetables in it
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   at any given time, and it's really good.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.440]   - Yeah, and again, it's like about finding the ways
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.200]   to make the vegetables taste really good.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.040]   'Cause if you're sitting there
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.940]   and you're like stabbing a sad piece of broccoli,
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.200]   you're not gonna enjoy the process of eating.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.120]   And also there's some really interesting studies
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.640]   that show that the mood that you're in
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.720]   when you're consuming food literally impacts your digestion,
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.400]   impacts your nutrient absorption.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.560]   So making food tasty actually technically
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.000]   makes it better for you too.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.840]   - I like it.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.580]   So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.160]   which is actually true almost every day.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.520]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.400]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.600]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.480]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.840]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.600]   And it's so freaking comfortable,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.400]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.620]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.480]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.720]   unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.500]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.320]   And it's not just for men.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.120]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.780]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.040]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.360]   the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.260]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.720]   whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.200]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.120]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.160]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.660]   And for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.440]   they are offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.100]   Being a parent can be scary,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.620]   whether it's watching your toddler
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.500]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.740]   or the indescribable pain of stepping
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.620]   on tiny plastic dinosaurs in your bare feet,
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.440]   both of which happened to me recently.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.300]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.900]   is getting life insurance,
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.660]   especially when you do it with Fabric,

[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.460]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.460]   and found Fabric to be highly competitive

[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.380]   not available in certain states,
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.620]   price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.940]   Okay, let's get out of food for a moment.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.180]   Talk about hacks related to health,
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.820]   what you've written about, what you blog about,
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.660]   what you podcast about.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.700]   It's like about being healthier with people.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.580]   What have you got?
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.020]   I know there are a bunch of things you do in your routine.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.780]   Let's talk about some.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.580]   - So a hack that I'm loving right now
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.500]   is to set the bar way lower.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.420]   So I think a lot of people think about something
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.700]   like working out or meditation,
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.460]   and they're like, "I don't know, I'm so busy already.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.100]   "I know these things are good for me,
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.140]   "but how do I actually fit them into my life?"
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.820]   And I think that if instead of sitting down
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.840]   and being like, "Well, I have to do 20 minutes of meditation
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.060]   "to make it effective."
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.880]   You're like, "I'm gonna do five minutes of meditation.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.000]   "I'm gonna do 10 minutes of meditation."
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.140]   First of all, it makes it so much more
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.740]   achievable and attainable,
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.500]   and if something is achievable and attainable,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.740]   you're so much more likely to keep going at it.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.220]   You're not gonna try to do it for a week, fail, and give up.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.580]   But then also, most of the time when you sit down
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.300]   and try to meditate for 10 minutes,
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.140]   you're gonna love it.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.300]   It's gonna feel really good,
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.140]   and you might even want to keep going.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.900]   Or maybe you'll do 10 minutes for a week,
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.140]   and then the next week you'll do 11 minutes.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.020]   The next week you'll do 12 minutes.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.060]   And actually, I had a woman on my podcast
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.540]   who studies focus, and she studies meditation
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.060]   and its effects on your brain.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.220]   And 12 minutes is literally the minimum viable dose
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.580]   to have incredibly potent neurological effects.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.740]   So if you're one of those people
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.820]   who feels scattered all the time,
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.060]   and you go to answer an email,
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.740]   and then you find yourself on Instagram,
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:25.260]   and you don't even know how your phone got into your hand,
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.900]   doing just 12 minutes of mindfulness practice
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.380]   every single day will massively help that type of thing.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.340]   It'll help you focus your attention.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.780]   It'll help you use your attention
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.740]   in the way that you want to use your attention.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:41.580]   So that's so much less than most of us think.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.740]   And by the way, that's not even every single day she does that.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.780]   I think four to five days a week was the study.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.300]   So 12 minutes, four to five days a week.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.580]   Same thing with working out.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.100]   I had a doctor on my podcast
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.260]   for a Ask the Doctor burnout edition.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.220]   So we talked all about what are the causes of burnout
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.540]   in our bodies, in our brains, and how can we address them?
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.300]   We were talking about the minimum viable dose
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.500]   of working out.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.940]   And it's anything that gives you a state of change.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.700]   So anything that makes it so that you sweat,
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.340]   so that your heart rate goes up,
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.740]   that is quote-unquote enough.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.940]   And I think that bar is so much lower than getting in your car,
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.980]   driving to the gym, doing an hour class,
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.340]   and yelling at yourself
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.100]   if you're not doing all of those things.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.420]   So one of my favorite hacks
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.380]   is anything that you want to do in your life,
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.380]   make it easier, make it less of a time commitment,
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.540]   and make it fun.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.820]   That's another really good hack
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.020]   is that anything that you want to do,
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.940]   if you can make it enjoyable, which sounds so silly.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.540]   You're like, of course, if you make something enjoyable,
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.860]   it will be easier to do.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.780]   I think there's this pervasive attitude with wellness
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.340]   that unless you're beating yourself up,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.460]   it's not really wellness,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.540]   that there's an element of suffering involved.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.820]   And that's not true at all.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.260]   So for instance, I had Katie Melkman on my podcast,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.620]   and she studies how we can essentially make the choices
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.340]   that we want to make and actually stick to them,
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.900]   how we can make those changes.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.900]   And one of her favorite things that she recommends
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   is taking something that you really love.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.980]   So if you really love like a TV show or a specific podcast,
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.820]   like all the hacks are healthier together,
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.460]   save that podcast for some time
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.660]   that you're doing something that's a little bit hard
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.900]   for you to motivate yourself to do.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.140]   So for me, that's working out.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.060]   I hate working out.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.420]   If I could just lay on the couch like a potato
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.340]   for the rest of my life, I would absolutely do it.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.820]   But I know that I feel so much better after I work out.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.380]   So I save my favorite podcasts.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.620]   I only listen to them when I work out.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.380]   And then I get excited to work out
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.500]   because I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.100]   I get to listen to my favorite podcast.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.500]   You can put on music that you love
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.620]   while doing your taxes.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.780]   You can have a little treat like a food that you eat
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.060]   or a favorite wine or something like that,
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.580]   or a friend that you call when you go for walks.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.900]   There's all these ways to sort of pair
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.140]   the thing that you really, really love
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.020]   with the thing that you have a harder time
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.300]   motivating yourself to do.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.780]   And it makes it fun.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.540]   And it creates that association in your brain
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.020]   so that you start to love the thing
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.260]   that you thought you didn't love in the first place.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.780]   - Does that mean that you wouldn't listen
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.820]   to your favorite podcast?
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.660]   - It does, yeah.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.500]   - Unless you're working out?
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.740]   - We recommend saving the things that you really love
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.980]   that really motivate you for when
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.380]   you're doing the hard things.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.220]   - I like that.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.060]   And I know meditation, 'cause I've heard you talk about it,
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.980]   was something that you tried for a while
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.180]   and it just didn't stick.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.220]   And I know I have, and many people have been like,
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.100]   yeah, I downloaded Headspace and I did that,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:27.940]   and then it didn't work.
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.260]   And you found a way to make it work.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.380]   Can you talk a little bit about that journey?
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.620]   - So my meditation journey has been really interesting.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.860]   I started meditating during what I like to call
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.180]   my mental breakdown period.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.900]   I was living in London with my now husband
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.700]   and I became completely agoraphobic.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.740]   I started having panic attacks whenever I left the house.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.620]   And that's the beginning of my wellness journey in general.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.780]   I was like laying prone in bed and emailing sources
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.460]   about how I could essentially stop having panic attacks
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.900]   at every single second.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.740]   And a lot of them recommended meditation,
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.620]   which really surprised me 'cause I was reaching out
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.700]   to people more in the hard science arena.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.780]   They also recommended foods and supplements
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.700]   and that's how I began to cobble together
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.500]   my personal wellness journey.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.580]   So I've tried meditating with Headspace
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.220]   and it did help a little bit.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.580]   I will say that Andy Puddingcombe
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.220]   has like a very soothing voice.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.580]   So nice British tones in there.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.140]   And I was in England and that was probably
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.420]   the only British person that I was like
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.380]   regularly having interactions with
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.980]   was Andy Puddingcombe in my ears.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.540]   So I do think that it helped a little bit.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.020]   And then later for a story, I did Vedic meditation training,
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.020]   which is much like transcendental meditation training.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.420]   And that worked for me,
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.220]   but not for the reasons that you might think.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.660]   So TM is a mantra-based meditation.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.420]   So you get a secret mantra, you pay money,
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.740]   and then you go to this five-day workshop.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.660]   They whisper to you your secret mantra.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.980]   I don't know where it comes from.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.900]   They tell you your mantra.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.220]   And I think the idea is that
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.540]   if you went to five different teachers,
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.100]   they tell you the same mantra based on, I don't know.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.180]   I literally don't know what is based on like your height
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.420]   or your vibe or your energy or like your name,
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.260]   but you get your mantra.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.460]   You're not supposed to tell it to anybody.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.940]   So I don't know my husband's mantra
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.140]   and he doesn't know my mantra,
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.380]   but he knows my Gmail password.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.460]   And then you repeat that mantra to yourself in your head
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.420]   over and over and over when you meditate.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.500]   So one of the reasons that I think it works
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.300]   is because it focuses your attention.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.700]   Instead of being like, don't think about anything,
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.500]   which makes you think about everything,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.620]   you have a thing to think about.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.340]   You just think about your mantra over and over.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.460]   So I think you could use literally any mantra
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.420]   and it would have that effect.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.020]   So hum is a really great starter mantra.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.740]   You can just sit there and repeat so hum
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.780]   to yourself in your head.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.060]   And I think it'll have a really positive effect.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.660]   You can also just sit there and watch your breath
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.860]   or you could listen to Andy and that's great.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.980]   But the other reason that I think that it was so effective
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.860]   was 'cause it was really expensive.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.900]   And I think that making an investment in something
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.700]   in that way is so motivating in a way
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.820]   that we don't talk about.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.340]   So instead of being like,
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.780]   well, I don't feel like meditating today.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.380]   I was like, ugh, I spent $500 on this stupid course.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.020]   You better meditate to make it worth the money
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.100]   that you spent on the course.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.300]   So I do think that to the extent that you have the privilege
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.060]   to make a financial investment in something,
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.740]   it works for something like booking a workout class
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.700]   in advance or there's even sites where you can like bet
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.180]   against your ability to do something.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.500]   So if you wanna quit smoking
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.580]   or you wanna work out every day or something like that,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.020]   I do think if you can tie your finances in
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.620]   with it a little bit, it is weirdly motivating.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.500]   So I've been a pretty regular meditator.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.820]   Again, my bar is low.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.500]   I don't think I need to be perfect.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.580]   I don't need to do it every single day
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.220]   and I don't berate myself ever,
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.700]   but I do think that putting the cost investment on the line
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.100]   was a really big motivating factor for it finally sticking.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:53.940]   - That's awesome.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.100]   Yeah, I know a handful of people that swear by their mantra
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.500]   and every time I'm like, I don't understand it.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.340]   What is the mantra?
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.180]   No one will ever share it.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.380]   - I should look into it.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.060]   Where does the mantra come from?
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.900]   I don't know.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.940]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.780]   - I have no idea.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.620]   - You should try it.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.460]   Do you meditate?
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.140]   - I have spent time with it.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.340]   Hotel might have like a breath meditation class.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.180]   We'll go do it.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.620]   It's not, I'm not afraid of it,
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.660]   but I just have not ever found a way to make it stick,
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.580]   but it's something that it's like on that long list
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.460]   of things that I wanna bring back into life,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.100]   but has been on the list for years.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.940]   - I also find it helpful to literally look up
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.500]   all of the health benefits of it.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.140]   'Cause the second that you are aware
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.740]   of all of the massive benefits you can get in your life
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.820]   by doing something like meditating,
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.020]   it just becomes so much more motivated.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.740]   On the focus episode of the podcast,
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.020]   we talked about whether you could just do activities
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.180]   mindfully, like mindfully wash your dishes
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.500]   or mindfully go for a walk.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.100]   And that does have a certain amount of benefits,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.740]   but not nearly the same benefits
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.860]   as that concentrated dose of mindfulness
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.740]   of 12 minutes a day.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.140]   What she talked about, interestingly,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.700]   is partially like training ourselves to sit in discomfort
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.660]   and training ourselves to not like the experience in a way.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.500]   - I like that.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.260]   Like forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.580]   A few other things that I know you at least regularly do.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.420]   - Yeah.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.460]   - Cold showers. - Cold showers.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.100]   I know, we talked about this on my,
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.260]   when I interviewed you, you don't do them.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.100]   - Well, it's funny.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.260]   Sometimes I want a cold shower.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.220]   - It's not about if you want a cold shower.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.260]   - So I don't have a practice of forcing myself
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.660]   to take a cold shower.
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.500]   But sometimes I'm like,
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.340]   I just kind of enjoy a cold shower right now.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.580]   My wife thinks I'm crazy.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.020]   - When you're in like Columbia or like just in normal life?
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.860]   - Just like some days I'm like, I'm running hot today
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.460]   and I'll take a shower and I'll just like,
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.420]   it's not the coldest it gets, but it's by no means warm.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.260]   - Right.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.540]   - But I think what you do is not that.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.420]   - It is not that.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.060]   And I would actually say that wanting to do it
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.540]   almost takes away from the reason that we do it.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.700]   And when I explain why, you'll understand.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.820]   So first of all, I want to preface,
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.700]   I do not do the whole shower cold.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.020]   Like I am shampooed and washing my body
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.980]   in a nice warm toasty shower, like you might think.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.980]   And then at the very end, I breathe in really deeply
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.300]   and I turn the thing to as cold as it gets.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.540]   And the idea is you want to be as cold
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.460]   as you can comfortably be without feeling
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.860]   like you're in any sort of danger in any way.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.420]   So I go as cold as possible and I do a minute is my goal.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.380]   Always again, kind of having those lower goal posts,
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.020]   but sometimes I'll go a minute and a half up to two minutes.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.780]   I think aiming for 12 to 15 minutes a week is ideal.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.620]   Not a day.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.440]   (laughing)
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.280]   - I mean--
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.100]   - The face you just gave me.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.500]   - I know, when I heard 12 to 15 minutes,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.540]   I was like, "Wow, I got 12 minutes of meditation a day,
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.860]   "I got 12 minutes of cold."
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.460]   - 12 to 15 minutes a week, which is not that much.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.220]   And again, you're kind of like habit stacking.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.580]   You're in the shower already.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.580]   I like it because it's this tiny, tiny, tiny thing
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.980]   that you can do that'll have a big effect on your health.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.840]   So you're like, "What is the effect on your health?"
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.340]   First of all, if you're vain,
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.980]   a cold shower is gonna make your skin glow.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.580]   It's gonna make your hair really shiny.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.260]   So if you wanna look really pretty,
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.300]   which I can tell by your face,
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.840]   you're like, "This is appealing to me."
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.680]   - Of course.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.500]   (laughing)
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.940]   - If that is the goal, it's gonna help with that.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.640]   So the same reason you see people do their ice rollers
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.100]   for inflammation and face puffiness,
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.660]   the cold shower's gonna have that effect,
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.420]   but basically on your entire body.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.260]   Wonderful.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.660]   The reason I do it, though,
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.580]   is to help balance my dopamine levels.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.860]   So do you know Dr. Anna Lemke?
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.700]   - I do not.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.860]   - She's a wonderful Stanford professor
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.900]   who basically her entire practice
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.100]   is devoted to studying dopamine.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.620]   And dopamine is the neurochemical of motivation.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.380]   I think people confuse it with serotonin a lot,
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.020]   and I certainly did before I interviewed her.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.060]   It's not the chemical of happiness.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:30.940]   It's about motivation.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.700]   It's about our desire and drive to do things.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.620]   And so a lot of the technology that we use,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.860]   drugs and alcohol,
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.180]   these things that are so easy to motivate yourself to do,
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.740]   it's because they encourage your dopamine receptors
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.680]   to essentially pump out dopamine.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.520]   But when you do that,
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.900]   dopamine can essentially get out of balance,
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.540]   which has a number of pretty negative effects on you.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.100]   It makes it harder for you to be motivated
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.180]   to do the things that you wanna do in your life,
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.980]   and it can also make it harder for you
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.180]   to find pleasure in the simple things,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.560]   like going for a walk,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.580]   or watching the sunset,
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.460]   or just these little moments.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.260]   It's why I think sometimes you'll see
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.500]   a group of friends out at dinner together,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.140]   and instead of wanting to talk to each other,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.820]   they're all wanting to be on their phones,
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.540]   and you're doing the fun thing.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.360]   You're out with your friends,
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.560]   but that dopamine imbalance is causing you
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.420]   to wanna reach for your technology even in those moments.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.360]   So if we can do things
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.520]   that feel a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.840]   we can bring our dopamine back into balance,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.360]   which will make it easier for us to motivate ourselves
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.040]   to do hard things in the other facets of our lives,
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.360]   and easier for us to experience pleasure
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.720]   in those smaller moments
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.600]   that aren't causing these huge dopamine bursts.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.780]   So hard things include things like cold showers.
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.640]   So if you can just add in this little moment
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.100]   of being uncomfortable,
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.780]   of pushing yourself to do something
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.100]   that's a little bit difficult for you,
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:01.300]   it has all of these longer outsized positive effects.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.420]   By the way, it doesn't need to just be a cold shower.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.700]   She mentioned in the episode
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.900]   walking to get her groceries in the rain.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.620]   The big takeaway for me was that discomfort
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.980]   isn't something that we're trying
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.720]   to eliminate from our lives.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.860]   Discomfort actually has this really positive
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.420]   and balancing effect.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.940]   So if you find yourself as the type of person
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.820]   who's always reaching for your phone,
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.020]   who has a hard time getting motivated,
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.100]   who isn't sure where they can find
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.020]   those little moments of pleasure in their life,
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.940]   I think looking and leaning into those moments
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.800]   of discomfort can feel really satisfying.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.300]   - There are also a lot of health benefits
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.220]   of cold water as a therapy.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.100]   So you didn't even mention all that world,
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.380]   but I know that Cold Plunges and Wim Hof,
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.980]   who some people listening know,
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.200]   other people can Google,
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.980]   has done a ton of stuff with the health benefits
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.900]   of cold water therapy and breath work.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.780]   - And I think a lot of that comes down to inflammation.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.300]   I think if we can sort of manage
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.580]   our inflammation levels at a base state,
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.820]   it has these cascading positive effects on our bodies.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.860]   But for me, as a person who finds it very hard
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   to do hard things, I like the idea
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.380]   that I can do this one little hard thing
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.700]   and it'll make all the other hard things
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.020]   feel so much easier.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:16.860]   - I love it.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.940]   To get very specific, you turn on the cold water.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.780]   - Yeah.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:23.060]   - Are you then like showering, splashing all over,
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:23.900]   getting it everywhere?
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.720]   - Yeah, so I'm cleaned by then.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.940]   - Or are you just like standing there frozen?
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.500]   - So at first I do my face,
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.300]   because again, I'm trying for my glowing skin effects.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.140]   So I am vain, and so I first put my face under,
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.180]   that's horrible, it's excruciating.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.700]   But I do that probably for like 20 to 30 seconds.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.660]   Then I do my front, and then I turn around
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.540]   and I do my back.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.900]   I do try to kind of do right on the back of my neck
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.360]   because that encourages brown fat in your body,
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.700]   which has a whole host of positive effects.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.340]   Look up brown fat if you would like to.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.980]   And then I just try to withstand it
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.380]   as long as I possibly can until I turn it off and get out.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.500]   And again, I give myself full permission
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.460]   to stop at 60 seconds every single time.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.460]   I think that keeping it as quick as possible,
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.300]   and the 60 seconds goes by really fast, you know?
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.120]   - I like it.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:07.960]   I will--
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.800]   - You like it?
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.620]   - I will try it.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.460]   - And you commit to, try it for,
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.460]   this is another wellness thing.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.180]   I think that we often are like,
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.300]   oh, I did the wellness thing, where's my great effect?
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.100]   But you're not using it long enough,
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.780]   and not using it consistently enough to get those benefits.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.700]   So add in your vegetables, do it for a month.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.500]   Do your workout for a month or two
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.460]   before you start sitting around and being like,
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:29.660]   why isn't it working?
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.020]   Meditate for a month or two.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.180]   So how long are you gonna commit
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.860]   to doing your cold showers for?
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.460]   - Hmm, it's funny 'cause we have a hot tub,
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.960]   and I was like, maybe I should just turn the water
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.160]   and just let it get cold,
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.220]   and then just do like the full submersion.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.180]   'Cause funny enough-- - You can also get,
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.420]   you know, you can buy a cold plunge pool.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.160]   - I know, in a conversation in a past episode,
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.200]   I talked about the DIY versus the fancy expensive one.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.280]   I'm down to experiment.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.040]   - So this, I do think though,
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.040]   you're immediately trying to complicate it.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.440]   And I feel like, do the plunge thing later.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.280]   - Yeah.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.680]   - Transform your hot tub later.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.540]   But for right now, literally with doing nothing,
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.900]   you could take a cold shower at the end of your shower today.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.020]   So I'm like, set your bar a little lower.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.700]   - I'll try it for April.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.780]   - Okay, all of April,
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.180]   and then will you like announce on Twitter or something
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.280]   how it went for you?
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.120]   - I'll just talk about it.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:19.940]   I'll bring it up.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:20.780]   - Bring it on the podcast?
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.460]   - Stay tuned for Chris's cold shower journey.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.860]   - I'm gonna do cold showers for a month.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.100]   - Everybody should join you too.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.740]   Anybody listening who hasn't had a cold shower,
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.340]   join Chris on his cold shower journey.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.180]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.020]   By the time you hear this, maybe you'll make it May.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:32.860]   - Yeah.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.520]   (air whooshing)
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.560]   Okay, it's funny that Liz was talking about Athletic Greens
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.100]   because I'm also a huge fan,
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.180]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   I started taking it
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.540]   because I wanted to see what all the hype was about,
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.980]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for over a month now.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.380]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.460]   add a few ice cubes, and head to my office for the day.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.820]   Look, I wish I could say
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.920]   that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.240]   but the reality is that I am not.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.240]   So I love having an easy way
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.340]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.000]   and it's a bonus that it happens to taste great.

[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.100]   minerals, and superfoods,

[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.180]   it costs less than drinking a cold brew coffee each day.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.740]   To make giving it a try easy,

[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.300]   that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.900]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.780]   So I love having an easy way
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.000]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.860]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.740]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.980]   for this episode.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.020]   I started taking it
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.300]   because I wanted to see what all the hype was about,
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.420]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.780]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.940]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.300]   and I head to my office
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.520]   feeling focused and energized for the day,
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.260]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.660]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.220]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.940]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.

[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.300]   of immune-supporting vitamin D

[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.660]   What about circadian walks?
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.700]   It sounds much more pleasurable than a cold shower.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.940]   - I love my cirque walk.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.260]   So the circadian walk is the idea.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.060]   I don't know if you've heard of a hot girl walk,
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.740]   but that's just like.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.380]   - I have not heard of a hot girl walk.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.680]   - It's literally just walking.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.480]   And I think there's a lot of different ways
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.620]   that people are trying to make something as simple
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.820]   and wonderful as walking like trendy.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.260]   And circadian walks essentially bring a little bit
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.100]   of science into the age old practice of walking,
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.020]   which is a really beautiful and wonderful practice.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.420]   Speaking of the focus episode,
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.180]   you said one of the best ways if you wanna regain focus
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.740]   for a meeting or something like that
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.180]   is just go for a 10 minute walk.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.020]   Something where you can look a long ways in the distance,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.660]   where you're not thinking about anything directed.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.140]   And if you have a big meeting or a speech or presentation,
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.020]   it'll help massively with reinvigorating that focus.
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.460]   But a circadian walk,
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.480]   you get the benefits of ambulation, of walking,
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.060]   but also you're gonna help control your circadian rhythm.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.880]   So this is a 10 minute walk outside before 10 a.m.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.460]   to help set your circadian rhythm for your day.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.580]   What is your circadian rhythm?
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.860]   Do you know what your circadian rhythm is?
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.100]   - I probably am not gonna explain it like you would,
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.500]   but the kind of general, yeah, I'll just let you explain it.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.580]   - Okay, so your circadian rhythm,
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.020]   I think a lot of people think about it
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.300]   in the context of sleep.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.300]   So it does impact your sleep hugely.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.700]   And I would say if you go for a circadian walk,
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.740]   again, 10 minutes outside before 10 a.m.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.340]   for I'd say a week or two,
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.620]   you'll probably start to notice
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.060]   some really positive effects in your sleep.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.180]   But your circadian rhythm also impacts
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.180]   so much more than that.
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.100]   Pretty much every single part of your body
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.140]   is running on its own little clock.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.220]   Like your digestion is running
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:01.140]   on its own little circadian rhythm, your hormones.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.100]   So when you set your circadian rhythm,
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.660]   when you encourage your circadian rhythm
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.980]   to function optimally,
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.660]   you're actually having all of these downstream effects of it
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.380]   outside of just your sleep being better.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.100]   You do not have to walk.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.020]   You can just stand there and look at the sun.
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.900]   I do think there's minor benefits to moving your body.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.860]   It helps wake you up.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.760]   If you're gonna just stand there, why not?
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.860]   But sometimes I will if I'm feeling very lazy.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.980]   But then I'd say the second circadian walk
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.260]   is the walk that's right as the sun is going down.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.820]   So the number one time if you can do it
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.140]   is in the morning.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.960]   Closer to when you wake up is better,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.940]   but I would say 10 a.m. is sort of the cutoff
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.260]   to get the benefits.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.580]   And then if you can also do it as the sun is going down
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.940]   as you're getting those sort of pinky, orangey,
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.460]   yellow tones of sunset,
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.160]   again, that will help kind of encourage
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.040]   your circadian rhythm to function at its optimal level,
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.020]   which is gonna help your sleep,
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.260]   it's gonna help your mood,
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.620]   it's gonna help your hormones,
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.860]   it's gonna help your digestion,
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.100]   the whole nine yards.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:56.920]   - I love it.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.540]   What other things in your routine are you doing?
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.780]   We got cold showers, we got circadian walks.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.900]   - Yeah, okay, so here's a weird one.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.220]   Do you know what hydroxyapatite is?
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.900]   - No, just assume the answer
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.100]   to all of these obscure questions.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:09.940]   The answer is just usually no.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:14.300]   - So hydroxyapatite is a fluoride alternative in toothpaste.
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.380]   So I do these like Ask the Doctor episodes
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.980]   where I do deep dives with functional medicine practitioners
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.040]   and I had a dentist on and I hear all the time,
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.100]   people are like, oh, I don't wanna listen
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.380]   to the dentist episode 'cause that sounds really boring.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:27.660]   But the more that we find out about our mouths,
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.620]   the more that we're finding out
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.260]   that it really impacts our entire health of our body.
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.620]   Like so much so that when I had the doctor
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.400]   on the Ask the Doctor immune health edition,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.580]   I said, what's one thing we can do
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.740]   that'll support our immune system?
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.640]   She was like, take care of your mouth
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.420]   because it's impacting your immune system,
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.580]   it's impacting your cardiovascular health,
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.980]   it's impacting your brain health.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.220]   Like literally your mouth microbiome
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.580]   is where all of these things are starting.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.100]   And fluoride, we're finding out more and more,
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.700]   has these really negative impacts on our overall health.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.260]   So you want all the benefits.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.060]   It's good for teeth, nobody's disputing that.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.980]   Everybody's like, fluoride, great for teeth, we love it.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.060]   Maybe not so much for our overall health.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.740]   So if we want the benefits of fluoride for our teeth
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.300]   without having the negative elements of fluoride
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.900]   for our health, Hydroxyapatite is a fluoride alternative.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.820]   It's been used in Japan for 30 years now.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.820]   It's very safe, it's literally as effective
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.060]   or more effective than fluoride in tons of studies.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.460]   You can find it in a toothpaste called Risewell,
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.900]   a toothpaste called Boca.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.100]   Those are just like normal toothpaste
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.060]   that you can buy online.
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.260]   And you're getting all of the mouth benefits
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.500]   while protecting your mouth microbiome
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.520]   and protecting the more downstream effects
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.400]   of fluoride in your body.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.180]   So Hydroxyapatite toothpaste.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.500]   I would say in a larger way,
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.540]   making little swaps to the things
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.940]   that you use every single day.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.820]   So that's another, people are like,
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.780]   oh, do I have to like wear organic clothes
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.220]   and do all this stuff?
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.660]   And I'm like, make over your bed.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.300]   You're gonna spend 12 hours,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:57.100]   well, you're gonna spend eight hours a day in your bed.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.700]   And if you can make your bed this little wellness haven,
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.580]   then you can skip a lot of the other stuff.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.060]   So if you can get a mattress that's not off-gassing,
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.880]   if you can get, I have organic sheets,
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.180]   I have a hypoallergenic pillow, things like that.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.700]   I have a silk pillowcase
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.380]   so that my hair and my skin looks really good.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.500]   I tape my mouth at night to sleep.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.900]   I think there's all of these things that you can do
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.940]   while you're sleeping to essentially enhance your wellness
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.060]   that you're not like having to think about during the day.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.940]   - So that was a lot of things.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.780]   - Yeah.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   - But what is taping your mouth?
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:33.220]   - Taping your mouth is the idea that essentially
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.020]   when you're breathing through your nose,
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.740]   you're getting a lot more health benefits
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.400]   for your body than when you're breathing through your mouth.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.720]   And I feel very strongly about this.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.240]   I actually had a reconstructive rhinoplasty in October.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.640]   I went surfing one time in my whole life
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.840]   and I broke my nose.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.360]   I hit myself in the face with the surfboard in Brazil
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.280]   and I got it fixed after that.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.240]   And after they fixed it,
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.600]   I couldn't breathe through my nose.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.240]   And the effects of not being able to breathe
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.920]   through your nose are so well-researched
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.720]   and so much worse than what we think.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.800]   For instance, my really severe anxiety
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.660]   started pretty closely with the time
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.340]   that I stopped being able to breathe through my nose.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.880]   And I'm not saying it's just that
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.460]   because obviously there's so many factors in one's life
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.680]   that you have to consider with something like anxiety.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.260]   But I also don't think that it's completely separate
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.640]   or completely unrelated.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.460]   So we want to breathe through our nose as much as possible.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.140]   It decreases stress.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:29.820]   It takes your body out of this like fight or flight mode.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.860]   It helps you think better.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.940]   It helps eliminate like foggy brain situation.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:37.040]   It's just generally so good for us.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.500]   But many of us have trained ourselves
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.840]   to breathe through our mouths all the time.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.260]   If you have a nose that can have air go through it,
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.460]   which I do now 'cause I had a piece of my rib taken
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.100]   and they built out my nose so it's like bigger
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.540]   and has passageways that are wide enough for air now.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.700]   So if you have a nose that can have air go through it,
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.900]   a nice practice to do is to gently tape your mouth
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.660]   and then it forces you to breathe through your nose.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.420]   So it's not a physical issue.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.540]   It's more of a habitual issue that you're trying to correct.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.940]   And if you're worried about it,
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.020]   if you're worried about suffocating,
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.480]   there's mouth tapes that you can get online
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:13.620]   that very much allow you to breathe through your mouth.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.220]   They just encourage you to breathe through your nose
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.340]   to experience all of those positive effects.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.580]   - And you do this every night?
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.140]   - I do it most nights, yeah.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.980]   - Wow.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.460]   - It also helps with snoring.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:25.900]   Again, if we're going from a vanity perspective,
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.500]   a lot of people who have like weaker chins,
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.140]   you'll start to see a difference in that
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.820]   if you start breathing through your nose
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.700]   because it literally reshapes your jaw in essence.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.940]   It'll help with your teeth health
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.300]   because when you're breathing through your mouth overnight,
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.260]   your mouth is drying out
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.360]   and you want to keep all that saliva in there
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.200]   because that's the thing
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.220]   that's essentially protecting your enamel.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.500]   It'll help with your teeth health,
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.340]   which will again have all those downstream positive effects
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.920]   because of your oral microbiome taking care of that.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.020]   Your breath won't smell as bad in the morning.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.620]   Not you, I don't mean to point to you for that.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.700]   - I'm like, wow, I'm sitting here.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.740]   I'm like, we're only five feet away and it's afternoon,
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.620]   but wow.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:04.140]   Okay, so much of what we do nowadays,
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.420]   especially I think about me and work
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.540]   and living at home during the pandemic,
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.980]   everything's online, everything's virtual.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.660]   When you came here today, you gave me a physical product,
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.020]   which I thought was so cool
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.500]   and it immediately made me jealous
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.860]   'cause I was like, gosh, I have a podcast.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.700]   I have all these listeners.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.740]   I don't have a physical product.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:22.540]   I wish I could have something to give people yet.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.540]   So I need to get inspired there.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   If anyone has ideas, let me know.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.900]   But can you talk about the deck of cards you gave me?
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.940]   - Yeah, so it's the Healthier Together deck.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.820]   I'm allergic to boring conversation.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.980]   I am also an extroverted introvert,
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.900]   an introverted extrovert.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.740]   So I wanna be around people
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.180]   and I wanna have the conversations,
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.500]   but sometimes I think there's a lot of pressure
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.620]   into taking it to those deep levels.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.700]   You kind of stay in the like, well, how are you?
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.420]   What's going on in your life?
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.820]   What are the world events?
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.620]   When actually we really wanna talk about
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.060]   those foundational things,
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.460]   like the things that make us the people that we are.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.180]   So I wanted to create a deck
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.380]   that basically gives you an excuse
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.460]   to have all the types of conversations
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.060]   that we want to be having
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.740]   that maybe are harder to bring into our everyday lives.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.700]   I actually think it's a huge reason why people love podcasts
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.580]   is because I just met you,
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.380]   but we're getting to have these sort of like deeper,
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.260]   more introspective conversations
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.060]   simply because there's a mic in front of us.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.300]   So what I like to say about the deck
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.420]   is it lets you get a lot of the benefits
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.420]   of doing something like a podcast.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.820]   It lets us bring the questions of something like a podcast
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.980]   into your kitchen table.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.580]   So I recommend having one in your car.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.420]   I made it really pretty
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.060]   so you can like leave it out on your coffee table,
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.220]   leave it out on your kitchen table.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.740]   And then you can just pull out a card
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.380]   anytime with a friend, with your partner,
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.500]   with like your mom and dad on a Zoom date,
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   instead of you're just like,
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.900]   okay, we like talked about Aunt Sally last week.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:42.780]   That's so great.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.300]   I'm glad your golf game is good.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.340]   You can pull out a card
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.300]   and really get to know people as people,
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.620]   and people will surprise you.
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.340]   My husband surprises me with his answers all of the time,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.620]   and it makes me feel closer to him
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.180]   and more connected to him and love him so much more.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.020]   - I love it.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.620]   Funny enough, when we had our au pair first arrive,
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.900]   the au pair agency sent us a deck of cards with questions.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.740]   - Oh my God.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.540]   - To try to get to know each other and your family.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.580]   - Oh my God, that's so fun.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.540]   - The weird thing was that-
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.660]   - Were they good?
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.020]   - Some of them were good.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.500]   The strangest thing was some of them are labeled,
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.180]   this is an au pair only question,
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.660]   and this is a host family only question.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.940]   And you would think they would be things like,
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.060]   what is it like growing up in America?
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.540]   - But some of them were strange,
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.020]   where it was like the host family,
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.860]   no au pair question is, what does happiness mean?
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.820]   And it's like, why is this a specific question?
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:34.820]   Why couldn't we all discuss it?
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.060]   - Yeah, that's so interesting.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.220]   - But I really liked that, but we've tapped it out.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.740]   It's not as big of a deck as this.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.460]   So I'm excited for this.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.580]   The card I pulled out somewhat randomly
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:46.900]   that I'll share as an example of a conversation starter
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.700]   is have you been anywhere in the world
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.980]   where you've thought the people here really got it right
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.700]   in terms of living a happy or healthier life?
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.700]   If so, where was it?
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:55.900]   - Yeah, so that's one of the questions
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.900]   that actually came directly out of my podcast.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:01.340]   So I like to ask people that at the end of episodes,
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.300]   because I think it says a lot
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.940]   about what we consider a good life.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.500]   It's not just about where are people getting it right?
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.620]   It's like, what is getting it right mean to you?
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.900]   And the questions are really designed around that.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.940]   We talked a lot when I interviewed you for my podcast
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.380]   about some of the more uncomfortable conversations,
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.060]   especially around money and things like that.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.020]   We have a whole wealth category in there.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.500]   So there's one question, and I love these questions.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.180]   They are interactive.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.460]   So there's one that's, would you feel comfortable
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.140]   sharing your salary with the group of people
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:30.980]   that you're playing with?
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:31.860]   Why or why not?
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.860]   And you can kind of explore these more taboo topics
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.420]   that people feel less comfortable directly addressing,
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.260]   but it's not you.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.380]   You're not the one bringing up the card.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.220]   Like it's not on you.
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:44.300]   It gives you a little bit of like an excuse to go there.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.140]   - Well, I like it.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.580]   We're gonna bring this to dinner tonight.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.420]   - Okay, you have to let me know how it goes.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.340]   - And I'll let you know how it goes.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.300]   For what it's worth, my answer to that question,
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.260]   because you didn't ask me in our conversation,
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.780]   was that when we were in Syria for about three weeks.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.140]   - Syria is my favorite country in the world.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.300]   I cannot believe you've been there.
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:00.140]   - Because you've been?
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.060]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:05.380]   What I found was that everyone was willing
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.820]   to put everything in their life on hold
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.580]   to get to know someone.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:13.420]   And so we would be meeting someone
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.980]   and you would think no one had anything to do.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.260]   We later learned that's not the case.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.860]   They'd be like, do you wanna come in for coffee?
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.980]   - For tea, yeah, the aggressive tea and coffee consumption.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.380]   - And then we would meet someone
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.300]   and someone's uncle would show up.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.420]   And then the uncle would be like,
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.180]   do you wanna come to my house and meet my family?
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.820]   And we were like, but it was more about
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.300]   getting to meet people and hospitality
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.620]   and all kinds of stuff than it wasn't required.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:36.860]   I had no expectation.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.820]   And it just felt like people genuinely wanted
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:39.660]   to get to know you.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.700]   And they would go grab things from their family
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.700]   and show you pictures.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.140]   And these are strangers, like people I didn't know.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:46.980]   And it was so great.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.540]   And I feel, especially in the last two years in America,
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.860]   we're not so much like that.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.700]   We're not like, hey, random person, I don't know.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.540]   Come on over.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.740]   Although in our case, you were here in my house
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:59.260]   and we met in person today.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.260]   - The hospitality is unmatched.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.380]   The people are so kind.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.860]   I think that like literally expresses
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.860]   in such a beautiful way.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.740]   One of the many reasons I love that country so much.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.740]   Also because there's citrus trees.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.300]   Damascus is this like walled city
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.340]   and the streets are so tiny.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.860]   They're basically walking only streets
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.020]   and they're like cobblestone
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.380]   or sometimes a tiny car will like try to drive through
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.660]   and everyone will be like, ah.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.980]   But they smell like citrus.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.860]   When did you go?
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.020]   - We went in 2009.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.020]   - I went in 2009 too.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.300]   - Yeah, so it was wonderful.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.940]   I don't know when it'll be a great place
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.780]   I would recommend going to.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.100]   - I wanna take my husband so much.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.980]   - And that leads me to the last question I wanna ask you.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.220]   We didn't talk much about
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.260]   your experience living nomadically.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.780]   So someone will have to find you on the internet
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.620]   to learn more there.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.420]   The latitude to pick anywhere you want.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.260]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.860]   - Most people pick wherever they're from.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.700]   - But I'm not from anywhere.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.900]   - You're not from anywhere right now.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.780]   And just tell me a place you'd recommend
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.060]   someone have a meal, grab a drink
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.620]   and something they should do.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.060]   - Okay, I'm gonna do London,
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.660]   which I haven't gone to in my nomad life.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.140]   So just for a little bit of context,
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.220]   my husband and I have been living nomadically
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.460]   for like the last two years.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.860]   So we spend four to six weeks in different places usually
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.100]   'cause they're beautiful mountain places.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.220]   We live in Airbnbs and just explore,
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.460]   which has been really, really wonderful.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.020]   And we can spend our rent money,
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.540]   which was New York rent money on the Airbnbs.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.740]   And it's been really magical.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.340]   But we lived in London when he went to graduate school
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.900]   and it's a really wonderful city.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.860]   So I would say the thing I want you to eat
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.580]   is I want you to go to Dishoom,
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.820]   which have you heard of Dishoom?
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.660]   - No.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.780]   - It is a phenomenal Indian restaurant.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.340]   They have started to sort of like branch it out
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.180]   a little bit more.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.620]   I think there's one in Edinburgh now
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.900]   and there's a few in different parts of London.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.500]   I like the Shoreditch one.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.220]   It's such a cool vibe inside.
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.380]   It's just like very cool decorations.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.580]   The black doll is one of the best things
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.940]   I've ever eaten in my entire life.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.380]   It's just phenomenal Indian food.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.860]   So I want you to eat there.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.020]   You can get a cocktail there too,
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.220]   because we'll have you get a drink elsewhere.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.420]   But I want you to eat there roughly.
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.740]   And then I want you to go for a canal walk.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.180]   So this is one of my favorite things to do.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.660]   You can start at Paddington Station.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.620]   I think you can even start further along,
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.940]   but you can start at Paddington
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.740]   and you can essentially walk the canals
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.660]   through the entire city of London.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.220]   You can walk pretty much all the way to East London,
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.820]   but I like to walk to Camden
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.300]   and then get out at Camden
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.100]   and then you can go to Camden Market.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.060]   But it's such a magical way.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.140]   England is a huge walking country.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.180]   Like all my friends in England,
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.500]   I went to a wedding and the next day after the wedding,
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.140]   they were like, "Well, should we walk back to London?"
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.380]   And I was like, "What?"
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.940]   And we were in the middle of the countryside
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.780]   and they were like, "Yeah, you can just like
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.860]   walk along the Thames until you get to London."
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.020]   And that's like what they do.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.940]   All my British friends, they love to walk.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.340]   We get to somebody's family house and they're like,
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.060]   "All right, should we go for a walk?"
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.100]   And you can walk London in this really beautiful
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:44.940]   kind of hidden way.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.620]   You can see a lot of the houses from along the canals.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.140]   You can see all the boats in the canals.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.140]   Sometimes there's like a coffee shop
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.500]   on a houseboat in the canal.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.780]   There's a little bookshop on a houseboat in the canal.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.060]   You walk through the zoo.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.900]   So you actually can see like bird cages
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.740]   and stuff in the zoo.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.740]   And then you get out at Camden Market,
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.860]   go for a little shop, get some like nitrogen ice cream.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.980]   And that's a really fun thing to do.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:10.060]   And then I'm failing to remember the name of the bar.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.100]   So I will give it to you and put it in the show notes.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.380]   But there's a bar right along the river
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:17.380]   that I believe is the oldest working wine bar,
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.420]   either in the UK or all of Europe.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.540]   And you walk in and it's like dark stones
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.700]   and it's just a really cool vibe.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.940]   So that would be my place I would say to have a drink.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.300]   - That is awesome.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.780]   My wife has not been to London.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.860]   - Oh, you guys have to go.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.380]   - Your Syria with your husband,
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.820]   for us is like London and Australia.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.620]   So they're high on the list.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.180]   Before we go though,
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.500]   where can people find everything you're doing online?
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.980]   - So the first thing I would say
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.140]   is that if you're interested in Chris
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   and hearing all of the hacks that he's ever learned
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:51.100]   in his life from the podcast and from beyond,
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.660]   you should definitely go listen to me interview him
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.940]   on my podcast, which is called Healthier Together.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.220]   It has basically everything you need
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.820]   to live your healthiest, happiest life.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.260]   So I interview world-class experts, doctors.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.780]   I try to get as many like tangible,
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.940]   actionable takeaways as possible.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.220]   So you won't just sit back and be like,
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.220]   I learned a lot, but what am I gonna actually do with that?
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.700]   I like to like get to the like,
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.260]   here's what you can do today to change your life

[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.660]   So Healthier Together podcast,
