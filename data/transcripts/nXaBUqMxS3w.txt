[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   I think it's really important to temper your expectations with the realism of what feels great.
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.500]   What is too much?
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.700]   What is just enough?
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.060]   Taking that and applying it to an actual real trip.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.060]   We like to build a scaffolding for people.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.140]   They have their, their flight in their flight out.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.140]   We know what their big purpose of going on this trip is.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.120]   It's relaxation.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.300]   It's seeing the sites, it's eating these meals.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.660]   It's going to a Taylor Swift concert.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740]   And then we put that centerpiece, that capstone somewhere in that trip.
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.980]   Everything else around that.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.500]   We ask a few questions.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.860]   How much activity and motion do you want to have?
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.460]   How many different things each day do you want to be doing?
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.020]   If you had to cut all of this out and just focus on one thing,
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.140]   what's the thing that matters the most?
