[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.420]   - Did you actually, when you decided to leave,
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.440]   get Financial Samurai to a place
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.880]   that it was gonna replace your job?
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   Or did you more just get it to a place
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.220]   that you saw an opportunity to do something different?
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.960]   - So my goal, first of all, was to save and invest
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   at least 50% of my after-tax income every year until age 40.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.360]   But I didn't last till age 40, I lasted till age 34.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.600]   And the reason why was because I was able
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.360]   to negotiate a severance.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.320]   Because during the global financial crisis,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.240]   you know, talk about making lemonade,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.100]   I saw many people get laid off,
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.560]   and some of them were my friends.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.040]   So I asked them, "Hey, is everything okay?
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.240]   "Can I help you find a job?
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.620]   "Do you wanna interview with me?
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.160]   "You know, I'm still surviving."
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.420]   And a lot of them were thankful, and we tried.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.080]   But I also asked them, "Are they okay?"
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.000]   And they said, "Yeah, I'm okay,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.700]   "because I got a severance equal
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.000]   "to two to three weeks per year work,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.080]   "two to three weeks worth of pay."
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.560]   And that was when I realized, oh, well, come 2012,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.440]   I will have been at my previous firm,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.920]   Credit Suisse, for 11 years.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080]   So if they gave me two to three weeks worth of severance,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.560]   you know, that's 22 to 33 weeks,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.840]   and if they could give me my deferred compensation,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.400]   because I was an executive director then,
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   and I had three years of deferred compensation
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.260]   in stock and cash, and a private investment
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.380]   that they made us buy in 2010,
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.420]   which were full of those, quote, toxic assets.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.420]   If I could get that severance
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.460]   and all my deferred compensation,
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.700]   there was no reason why I shouldn't take that leap of faith,
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.380]   because it bought years of living expenses.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.740]   - Most people listening to this are not,
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.780]   I mean, hopefully we aren't in the middle
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.380]   of a global financial crisis,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.500]   maybe just like a minor recession.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.380]   But, you know, are the tactics you use
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.000]   something that anyone could use,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.200]   or are they really dialed into,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800]   I'm in the financial company
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.680]   in the middle of a financial crisis?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.160]   - Yes, these are the tactics that anybody
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.720]   in any organization can use.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.680]   Because the biggest pushback I have is,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800]   why would anybody give me a severance
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.060]   if I'm a decent employee, right?
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.640]   I'm great, whatever.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.920]   The point is, if you wanna leave anyway,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.160]   and your heart is not into it,
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.720]   your employer doesn't really want you.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.440]   They want someone who's hungry,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.420]   who wants to do their best to stay overtime, do whatever.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.340]   And if you are a manager in this environment,
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.460]   still in this environment,
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.700]   it is very hard to find a replacement.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.100]   It could take three months, six months,
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.680]   and once you find the replacement,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.540]   it could take three to six months to train them
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.320]   to be up to par with your level.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.860]   And so if you say, peace out, see you later,
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.260]   two weeks notice, you actually leave your colleagues
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.340]   and your manager in a lurch.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.020]   They're gonna be scrambling to find your replacement,
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.980]   and they're gonna be suffering
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.900]   while they're looking for your replacement.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.260]   And so the idea of negotiating a severance
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.240]   is to think about the classic win-win scenario.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.920]   How can you help your colleagues and your manager
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.700]   find your replacement, provide seamless transition
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.220]   during that replacement finding, and train them
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.560]   so that when you leave, hopefully they'll save money
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.280]   and they'll replace you with someone who's hungrier,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.900]   cheaper, and just more motivated in general.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.140]   - And so that's the simple trade-off.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.100]   It's I'm going to help you make this transition easy,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.860]   and in return, you're going to give me money
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.460]   or vested stock or something.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.240]   And how have you seen that work?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.900]   I'm sure you've gotten readers write back,
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.540]   say this worked, it didn't work.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.260]   What's the kind of hit rate?
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.720]   - The hit rate is high.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.300]   It's like 80 plus percent.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.580]   And a lot of people just come back to me and say,
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.620]   I cannot believe I was able to leave on my terms.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.300]   I mean, a severance can not only be just a severance check,
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.180]   but it can be, hey, how about work three days a week
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.340]   out of five, and we'll still pay you
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.300]   the same amount of money.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.780]   So if you're working 40% less,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.860]   it's kind of like getting a 60% raise.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.140]   If you do that for six months, a lot of people will be like,
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.060]   hey, I'll take that.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.120]   I mean, that's pretty good bet.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.420]   Don't have to work for two days a week,
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.580]   shut it off and do my own thing.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.220]   I mean, so it's really great.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.540]   And a lot of people have just surprised and shocked
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.580]   by how they were able to negotiate something
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.220]   that they thought was not possible.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.900]   And in this day and age, I think the reason why
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.580]   a lot of people will ghost people on the phone,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.100]   text message, email, or not,
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.300]   they wanna just break up over the phone
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.620]   is because they're afraid of confrontation.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.500]   And that's, I would say like natural,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.220]   but it's also kind of cowardly, right?
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.720]   You wanna face your oppressor.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.700]   You wanna face the people who could help you and say,
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.060]   look, these are my reasons for leaving.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.460]   I've been a loyal soldier.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.380]   And the other thing is companies are afraid of backlash.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.620]   This is one of the things that companies
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.660]   are really afraid of.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.060]   There's social media, there's bloggers.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.180]   You can blow up a company online
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.900]   and say like a lot of bad things in like a tell-all.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   That's the last thing a company wants.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.180]   That's reputational damage.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.140]   And so companies understand this.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140]   They don't wanna get into a long litigation process.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.980]   They don't wanna get their reputation smeared.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.480]   So they wanna work with employees
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.820]   who have actually been there for at least a couple years,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.140]   three years, and try to come up with a win-win scenario.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.580]   - Is that metric that you had at Credit Suisse
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.580]   of two to three weeks pay for every year worked,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.220]   is that a general benchmark that kind of still applies
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.740]   or what do you think kind of is a broadly applicable
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.300]   benchmark for a severance package?
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.580]   - One to three weeks.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.300]   And three weeks being at the high end, maybe four weeks,
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.580]   but it's usually one to three weeks.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.380]   And there's one thing that people don't really understand
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.220]   and that is to differentiate between the Warn Act,
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.220]   which is a worker adjustment training notification
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.100]   and a severance.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.660]   So Warn Act pay is reserved for larger companies.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.860]   Usually I think it's in the hundreds or thousands of people
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.300]   and they do a mass layoff.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.460]   They're mandated by law to provide,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.420]   it's one to three months of severance pay
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.940]   or not severance pay actually, one to three months of pay.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.300]   That's by law, mandatory.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.540]   Whereas a severance is optional.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.700]   A severance is the company can pay you
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.100]   or they won't pay you, right?
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.980]   And so the idea is a lot of people who get two months,
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.980]   they think it's severance,
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.060]   but it's actually mandatory Warn Act pay.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.700]   Severance goes above and beyond that.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.020]   - And so now you're on your own and you start financials
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.420]   or you're still, let me think where I take this.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.300]   I know there are a lot of people listening
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.020]   who might want to use some of these tactics.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.060]   So I'll link the book in the show notes
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.300]   'cause we're not gonna spend a whole episode
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.300]   on how to engineer a layoff, though I'm sure we could.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.420]   And can people reach out if they have questions
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.140]   or how do you feel about comments and feedback?
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.380]   - So yeah, just go check out financialsamurai.com
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.820]   to buy how to engineer layoff.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.420]   It's about severance negotiations.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.780]   And I also have a lot of articles online
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.300]   about severance negotiations for free.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.180]   So you just Google severance negotiation financial samurai,
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.820]   leave a comment and I'll be able to see it
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.100]   because I can see it from the backend.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.500]   And if you have a question, I can respond to it.
