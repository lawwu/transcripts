[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Previously on Grace TV...
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   As surely as sparks off a fire fly upward, man is born for trouble.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   In fact, there is nothing more certain than the fact that we're all going to die.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   That alone is the certainty of life.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   He gave you life in order to sustain that life for His own purposes.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the Gospel?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   You have little faith.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:05.620]   And by the way, the Lord said that a number of times to the disciples.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.000]   It's recorded in Matthew, chapter 6, here in verse 17.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   "You have little faith."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Verse 30, and the parallel passage in Luke 12, "You're worried about clothes," according
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   to Luke.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.500]   Again, in Matthew 8, He says, "You have little faith," pointing out their fear of drowning
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.440]   in a storm when He was there.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   Matthew 14, another expression of Peter's fear and little faith.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.000]   Matthew 16, the disciples continually expressing this lack of faith.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   This went through the whole duration, you might say, of our Lord's ministry with the
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   disciples, that they continually demonstrated the inability to trust God for their lives.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.900]   It's a sin to have a lack of faith.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.320]   Not trusting God is a sin.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.920]   Understand His love.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.000]   Understand His care.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.080]   Understand His power.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.300]   Understand His abilities.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.720]   Understand His promises.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   So it is, first of all, a sin to worry because of our Father, because of our Father.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.820]   Go down to verse 31.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.200]   Here's the second time He says, "Do not worry."
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's in a different form.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "Do not worry," then, saying, "Do not worry."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.500]   It's saying, "What will we eat?
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.880]   Or what will we drink?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.820]   Or what will we wear for clothing?
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:54.280]   For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.000]   all these things."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.080]   First, seek His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   Secondly, He says, "Do not worry."
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.740]   Secondly, He says, "Don't worry because - " I guess you could call it "because of your family."
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.780]   Let's just use that term, "because of your family."
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.660]   You're not a heathen.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.740]   The term "Gentile" is the key term.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.760]   You're not part of the nations.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   You're not pagan.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.580]   You're not a part of the kingdom of darkness.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.000]   You're not outsiders.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.940]   It is needless.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.080]   It is senseless.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.860]   It is useless to worry.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:51.600]   It is faithless to worry when you're not a part of those who should worry because they have rejected their heavenly Father, because
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.460]   they have no hope, they have no promise.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.080]   They have turned against God, and God is their enemy, but not you.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   This is what Gentiles - and the verb is very strong - eagerly seek.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.860]   They live for this.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.900]   People outside the kingdom of God live for what they eat, what they drink, and what they
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.060]   wear.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.100]   The pagans, the Christless world, those who do not acknowledge God, do not know God as
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.860]   their Father, and have not come to Him to claim His provision and His promise.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.940]   They have reason to worry about their supply.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.980]   They're on their own.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.300]   Now there's a providential provision.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.080]   God allows the sun to rise and fall on the just and the unjust, and the rain the same.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.000]   And God has providentially built into the world common grace by which people's lives
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   can be sustained.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.960]   And mark it: they are sustained by God.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.940]   It is God who sustains the life of everything that lives.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.160]   From the smallest insect to the most significant human being, they are all sustained by God
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.440]   in a general sense by His global providence and common grace.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.600]   But they can lay no claim to deserving any provision from God by virtue of Him being
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.060]   their Father.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.940]   In fact, those who reject the truth are the ones who are not.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.940]   They are the ones who are not.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.900]   God have created gods of their own, false gods, and thus they have violated the first
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.660]   commandment and are under judgment.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.180]   They have no guarantee of their next breath.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.180]   They have no promise of a protector, no one to care for them.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.320]   They are outside God's kingdom.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.860]   They're in the kingdom of darkness.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.700]   They're in the kingdom of death.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.340]   They should be afraid.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.420]   The phrase of our Lord here is emphatic, and I mentioned it, but let me mention it again.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:12.080]   Verse 32: "The Gentiles seek," you could say, "with all their energy, totally consumed in
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.880]   material gratification for survival."
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.140]   But how different are we?
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:28.340]   We are in God's family, and God assures us of a full supply of everything we need.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.420]   It is shamefully wicked for a child of God to come down to the level of the heathen who
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.920]   don't know God.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.580]   You're in God's family.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.300]   The people of the world seek these things, and right they should, because they're their
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.600]   own protectors.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.920]   They are their own saviors, temporally speaking, in a sense.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.800]   They're on their own.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.780]   They need to worry about food.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.580]   They need to worry about drink.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.020]   They need to worry about clothing.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:06.840]   They need to worry about life.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.760]   But they have to understand this: to do that, you end up serving money.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.780]   Go back to chapter 6, verse 24: "You can not serve two masters, for either you will hate
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.080]   the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other."
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.820]   You can't serve God and wealth.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.520]   But the world has made its choice.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.580]   They will not serve God.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.360]   They will serve money.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.500]   Money is the ultimate God.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.640]   Whatever it takes for them to protect themselves, to provide for themselves, they pursue with
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:48.260]   all their powers.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:56.060]   That's the real reason people chase money, because they have no supernatural protector.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:03.680]   But one way to say it would be they have no invisible means of support.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.940]   We can't be like the world.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.600]   Sons of the King do not conduct themselves like the devil's beggar.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:21.080]   So ask yourself: "Do I face life like a Christian, like a member of the family of God, the kingdom
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.680]   of light, or like a pagan?"
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.320]   When things are difficult and a little bit unsure, how do I react?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:38.040]   By fear or doubt, as if it all depended on me?
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.460]   Or do I react with joy and confidence because I know it's in God's hands?
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.320]   It's one thing to say you're a child of God, you belong to His kingdom; hopefully when
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.680]   life turns out to be deadly or terrifyingly fearful.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:05.640]   That claim still holds, because your trust is evident.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:13.360]   It comes down to how Paul viewed life, and this is the bottom line, I think.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:23.440]   In 2 Corinthians 4:18 he said this: "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.360]   things which are not seen.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:35.520]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.740]   While everybody else is looking for the visible means of support, because that's all they
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:47.040]   have, we're content to rest in the invisible means of support, because - verse 32, again,
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.200]   repeats the first point - "your heavenly Father knows that you need God."
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.240]   need all these things."
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:08.320]   Our Father rules the universe, all the inanimate and animate realities; and He has loaded this
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.500]   planet with amazing wealth, with amazing life.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.740]   The most powerful thing in the temporal world is life.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.040]   I'm constantly amazed at the power of life.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:31.140]   Even a virus like this, this living virus, amazing power that you can't stop.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.720]   It's a living thing.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   It's like the weeds that grow up in every crack in your driveway.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.980]   Life is so powerful.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.680]   God is the source of all of that life.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:52.880]   All worry either assumes that God is not there, or that God does not care.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:00.520]   Or that God is there and does care, but can't do anything about it because He lacks the
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.920]   power.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.560]   He is either unaware, indifferent, or impotent.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:19.760]   But no, verse 32 says, "Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things."
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.720]   And verse 33 at the end: "And all these things will be done."
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.280]   "All these things will be added to you."
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:35.060]   He knows, which means He has the full awareness, and He has the power to provide.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.960]   He knows.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:45.420]   He has the full awareness, and He has the power to provide everything you need.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.940]   God does care.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.840]   God does know.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.560]   God does provide.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.220]   Worry is a sin.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.380]   Verse 25: "Don't worry because of who your Father is."
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:07.160]   Verse 31, the second use of that same verb: "Don't worry because of the family you're
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   in."
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.560]   You're not like the pagans, heathen outside the kingdom.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:22.400]   And thirdly and finally, verse 34: "Don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will care for
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   itself.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.680]   Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.180]   Don't worry because of not only your father and your family, but don't worry because of
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.020]   your future.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.980]   And here it says, "Don't start worrying about tomorrow."
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.800]   That's literally how you would translate that form of the verb, merom naō.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.880]   Don't start worrying about tomorrow.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.160]   Providing for tomorrow, that's wise; saving, that's wise; but God is the God of tomorrow,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.580]   just as He is the God of today.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:02.480]   How many times have you sung "Great is Thy faithfulness"?
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.780]   You probably can't even recall the number of times you have sung that.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:15.860]   But it comes basically from a text in Lamentations, chapter 3, written by Jeremiah.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:22.000]   Listen to what it says: "The Lord's lovingkindnesses indeed never cease.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   For His compassions never fail."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.980]   Verse 23 of Lamentations 3: "They are new every morning.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.000]   Great is Your faithfulness.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.680]   The Lord is my portion, says my soul; therefore I have hope in Him."
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.140]   The Lord's mercies are new how often?
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.460]   Every morning.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.840]   Why would you worry about tomorrow when the Lord's mercies are new every morning?
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.440]   Worry is a powerful force.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.160]   It can steal your joy.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.480]   It can rob you of contentment.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.040]   It can destroy your testimony with others.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.600]   It can fill you with anxiety and fear.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:16.800]   Even panic attacks are related to the kind of anxiety that fear produces and worry produces.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.260]   There are some people so committed to the sin of worry that there's nothing in the present
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.680]   to worry.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.620]   They start looking into the future to find something.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.780]   The Lord forbids that.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.620]   Your future is in His hands.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:38.140]   Your future is completely His.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:44.240]   Back to verse 34 where we're looking now: "So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.640]   will care for itself.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.520]   Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   Don't push your fears into the future.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.660]   God will give you strength for every new day.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.500]   His mercies are new every morning.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.080]   To anticipate trouble is to double it without the grace to endure it.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.620]   Because you're not there yet, you don't have the grace yet.
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:21.360]   To anticipate trouble is to double it when God will allow it only singly and provide
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.020]   you sufficient grace for it.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.360]   Fear is a liar.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.660]   Fear lies to you.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:37.820]   Fear tells you your future is not under control.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.580]   That's a lie.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.880]   Don't worry about tomorrow.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.160]   Tomorrow will take care of itself.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.960]   You've got enough trouble today.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   Deal with that.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.120]   God will be there in the future.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.300]   Hebrews 13:8, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.820]   Don't cripple the present by worrying about the future.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:10.540]   You destroy your joy, and you lose the present.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:17.780]   So worry is a forbidden sin, incompatible with the fact that God is your Father, you're
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.800]   a member of His eternal family.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:28.700]   And your future is completely cared for.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:36.180]   That makes worry stupid as well as sinful.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.180]   Let the pagans worry.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.320]   They have no protector.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.680]   They have no promise.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.580]   We're not spiritual orphans.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.100]   We're not out floating around on our own.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.120]   We're not spiritually homeless.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   We have a home.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.640]   We have a Father.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.620]   We have all of His resources and all of His riches at His disposal to dispense with us.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.620]   He loves us.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.760]   He cares for us.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.000]   He meets every need we have.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.520]   All He asks out of us is that we love Him, and that we obey Him, and serve Him, and not
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.600]   worry, because worry declares that we don't trust Him.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.480]   Either we don't trust that He's aware - when He is.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.200]   We don't trust that He cares when He does.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.880]   And we don't trust that He can do anything to protect us when He can.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:40.640]   This is really a sin against the God who loves you.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.280]   Backing up to verse 33, you really have the conclusion: "Seek first His kingdom."
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.160]   There you go.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.320]   Like the prayer.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.900]   "Seek first His kingdom, come; your will be done."
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.600]   Seek His kingdom.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.860]   Seek His kingdom, everything that is in reference to Him and His righteousness.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.040]   Walk in obedience.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.820]   Walk in righteousness.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.260]   Seek His kingdom, not the things of the world.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.660]   Seek to know Him, to love Him more.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.260]   Seek the things that make up the kingdom.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.160]   The kingdom of God is joy, peace, and love.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.940]   Peace, power in the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.700]   Seek His kingdom.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.980]   Seek His righteousness, and all these things shall be added.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.180]   All physical necessities will be added.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.660]   Everything you need now, and everything you need in the present, and everything you would
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.000]   ever need in the future, all these things will be added for you.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   "And through the Lord."
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.880]   And Scripture says, "Eye has not seen, nor has ear heard, nor has it entered into the
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.220]   heart of man the things that God has prepared for those that love Him."
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.640]   Long for God's glory, and He will give you the rest.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:14.080]   Obey Him, and He will fill your life with all good things.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.840]   That's the one positive command in this whole passage, three times a negative command.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.080]   Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.600]   What sets worry aside, what buries it, is to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.080]   Be concerned about God, His glory, His righteousness.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:43.560]   Be concerned about being an obedient believer, trusting believer, and God will pour out heavenly
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.680]   blessing on you.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.000]   Over in the tenth chapter of Luke - and this would be a good place maybe to wrap up our
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:05.360]   thoughts - but in Luke, chapter 10, our Lord is in the house of Mary and Martha.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:12.480]   It says in verse 38 of Luke 10, "They were traveling along, and He entered a village,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.940]   and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.520]   She had a sister called Mary.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.420]   She was seated at the Lord's feet, listening to His Word.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.200]   But Martha was distracted with all her preparations.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.580]   And she came up to Him and said, 'Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.280]   do all the serving alone?
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   Then tell her to help me.'
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.920]   The Lord answered and said to her, 'Martha, Martha, you never want the Lord to say your
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.240]   name twice.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.360]   It's not good.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:55.860]   Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:05.800]   But only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.280]   be taken away from her.'"
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.200]   You're fussing about the food.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   She is listening to the Word.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   You're preoccupied with physical needs.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:27.100]   She is consumed with spiritual nourishment.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.960]   That's the best part.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.580]   Why?
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.960]   Because man does not live by - what?
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:42.520]   - bread alone, but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of God, which originally
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.200]   comes from Deuteronomy 8.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.040]   So you want the best part.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   The best part: seek the kingdom.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:59.440]   You want to seek the kingdom, then sit at the feet of Jesus, as verse 39 indicates Mary
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.560]   did, and listen to His Word.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.220]   Fill up on His Word.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.760]   Be thankful.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.540]   Be encouraged.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:16.440]   Walk in the path of righteousness, and God will supply everything you ever need.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.880]   Let the Word of Christ be your guide.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   The Word of Christ dwells in you richly.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   The Word of Christ dwells in you richly.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   This is a time, I think, for all of us who are believers to rise above the fray and the
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   panic.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   This is a time for all of us as believers to demonstrate our trust in the Lord.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   This is a time, I think, for all of us who are believers to rise above the fray and the
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   panic.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   This is a time for all of us as believers to demonstrate our trust in the Lord.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   Let's make sure we give honor to our Father and our family and His promises of our future.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   Let's make sure we give honor to our Father and our family and His promises of our future.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   John, that is one of the most wonderful things that we've ever experienced.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.880]   I have a feeling that I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   I have a feeling that I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   I have a feeling that I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   I have a feeling that I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   I have a feeling that I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   I'm going to be a part of the church.
