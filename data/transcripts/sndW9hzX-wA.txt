[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   what do women want?
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.960]   Tell me all the things women want in a long-term mate.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.960]   And so I would start at one end of the blackboard,
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.280]   there were like five blackboards,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.000]   and I'd say, well, I want a mate who's kind,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.160]   who's understanding, who's intelligent, who's healthy,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.480]   who's got a good sense of humor, who shares my values,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   and I'd fill up five blackboards and then run out of space.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.920]   So then I turned to the men and I'd say,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.960]   well, what do men want?
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.720]   And then I run out of space
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.360]   after about a blackboard and a half,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.000]   'cause they can't think of anything else.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.840]   So women-
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.160]   - I think there's a lot of explanations for that.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.600]   The following is a conversation with David Buss,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.120]   evolutionary psychologist at UT Austin,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.640]   researching human sex differences in mate selection.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.440]   He's considered one of the founders
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.920]   of evolutionary psychology
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.180]   and has authored many exciting and challenging books,
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.320]   including "The Evolution of Desire,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.440]   "Strategies of Human Mating,"
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   "Bad Men, The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.880]   "Harassment and Assault,"
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.240]   and "The Murderer Next Door,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.160]   "Why the Mind is Designed to Kill."
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.540]   We talk a lot about sex, dating, relationships, and love.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.300]   I take these, at times, controversial topics very seriously,
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.120]   but I also try to inject humor and ridiculousness
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.080]   throughout this conversation, and all conversations I do.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.920]   Please do not mistake my silliness for a lack of seriousness
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.560]   and my seriousness for a lack of silliness.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   And above all, do not mistake my suit and tie or my PhD
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.920]   as a sign of intelligence or wisdom.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.800]   I barely know what I'm talking about on most days.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.660]   I'm simply curious and hoping to understand
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.280]   the way a child does, what the heck is going on
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040]   in this weird and wonderful civilization of ours.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.060]   If I say something stupid, as I often do,
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.800]   I promise to learn and to improve.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.320]   As Mark Twain said, "I do not want my schooling
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.040]   "to interfere with my education."
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.560]   Open-minded curiosity, I think, is the best guide
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.280]   for a proper and fun, lifelong education.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.200]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.180]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.420]   in the description.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.880]   And now, dear friends, here's David Buss.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.860]   What is more important in the history
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.120]   of the development of human civilization,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.960]   sex or violence?
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   So mating strategies or military strategies?
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.800]   - Oh, well, both are important.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.680]   I mean, first of all, humans are a sexually
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.520]   reproducing species, and so everything
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   has to go through sex.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   So our mating psychology has to be very rich and complex
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.200]   because to succeed, for us to be here now,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.080]   all of our ancestors in an unbroken chain
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.600]   have had to succeed in selecting a fertile mate,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.800]   attracting that mate, be mutually chosen by that mate,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   stay together long enough, do all the sexual things
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.680]   you need to do to reproduce, have the kids survive,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.520]   et cetera, so everything has to go through mating.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.720]   And in that sense, I think it's, I mean,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   survival is really only a means to an end, if you will.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.680]   So sex has gotta be important, and humans have
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120]   a very rich, evolved sexual psychology
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.520]   or an evolved mating psychology.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.760]   Okay, but I wouldn't minimize the importance
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.320]   of violence either.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.000]   There's a ton of evidence that humans evolved
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.400]   in the context of small groups and with a fair amount
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.160]   of small group warfare, so intertribal warfare,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.400]   where, and this is a harsh realization,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.840]   but there historically, this is part of our bad
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.920]   evolutionary history, it has been advantageous
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.400]   from a purely reproductive standpoint to conquer
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.360]   a neighboring group, kill the males,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.200]   and get whatever resources they have,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.160]   including females and sexual resources,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.880]   as well as tools, weapons, territory, and so forth.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.920]   And so I think that we have, and of course,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.720]   it's typically males who do that.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.480]   I mean, yes, some females have participated in warfare,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.440]   but as far as I know, there's never been a single case
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.080]   in all of human recorded history of women forming
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.200]   a war tribe with other women to attack another group
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.680]   of women and kill them and capture the men as husbands.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   But this phenomenon is common in the ethnographic record
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.640]   and small group studies.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.480]   It's part of our common thing.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.640]   So just one concrete example, unfortunately,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.400]   he's dead now, he passed away, Napoleon Chagnon,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.460]   who studied the Yanomamo for many, many years,
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.240]   when he first started interviewing them,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.640]   he asked them, "Why do you go to war?"
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.600]   And they said, "Well, to capture women, of course,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.640]   "but it's the only sensible reason."
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.800]   And then he said, "Why does your culture go to war?"
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.280]   However they phrased it.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.220]   And he said, "Well, we go to war to spread democracy
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.800]   "and ideas and everything."
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.600]   They basically fell off their logs laughing
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.960]   at such a stupid reason, because why risk your life
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.160]   for anything other than women?
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.680]   Of course, it's more complex than that,
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   because some go to war for reputational reasons.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.880]   They say, "If we don't retaliate,"
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.080]   'cause we've been attacked and they've stolen
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.740]   three of our women, "If we don't retaliate,
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.940]   "then we will get a reputation as exploitable,
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.640]   "and then other groups will start to attack us as well."
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.020]   And so they get into these cycles of,
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.660]   like the Hatfields and McCoys of attacks, counterattacks,
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.660]   retribution, and part of it is reputation management.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.680]   So that's between groups, and I think that's been
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.680]   the primary source of violence, but not the only source.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.560]   So there's also within-group conflict,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.440]   and so many ethnographies, many traditional societies
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.200]   have things, some of them are ritualized,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.920]   like wrestling matches, or in the Anamama,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.160]   they have these, or used to, these chest-pounding duels,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.480]   where, so if we're in this match, you challenge me,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.160]   and I have to, of course--
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.920]   - Chest-pounding duel.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.760]   (Dave laughs)
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.600]   I like this.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.360]   - So you're not hitting each other,
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.160]   you're just, it's like peacocking, you really--
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.600]   - Oh, no, you're hitting each other.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.440]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.760]   - Yeah, so they get 20 paces away, and they run up,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.640]   and you punch the other guy in the chest,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.680]   and he has to basically stand there,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.520]   and then he does the same to you.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.000]   - Wrists and everything, oh, wow.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.080]   - And then it's basically last man standing.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.160]   - That's, well, I suppose that's better than the face.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.480]   That's an interesting decision with the chest.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.320]   - Yeah.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.280]   - I mean, I'm sure if you get good at that kind of thing,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.240]   you could start breaking ribs,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.960]   and you can get loose about the rules
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.160]   of where exactly in the chest you can hit.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.800]   And there's that guy who's always known for hitting
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.720]   not exactly in the chest, accidentally missing.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.920]   - Right, right, the Mike Tyson of--
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.520]   - Exactly, eating your ear off.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.000]   So interesting, so there's ritualized conflict,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   sort of purify the competition,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.360]   and that resolves some kind of issue.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.960]   - Well, yeah, it's important to establish status hierarchies.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:57.600]   But also, and here's just one more concrete point on that.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.720]   Yanomamo, we don't have this in our language.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.400]   We just have one word for kill or murder,
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.760]   but Yanomamo have, you're either an,
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.160]   if you're a male, you're an unokai or a non-unokai.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.840]   The non-unokai are men who have not killed.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.200]   If you're an unokai, that means you have killed someone.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.960]   And the unokai among Yanomamo historically
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.360]   had higher status and more wives,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.880]   so they're a polygynous society,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.520]   which has been true of something like 83 to 85%
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.200]   of traditional societies, or actually,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.400]   I was just corrected by an anthropologist.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.720]   She said, "We no longer call them traditional societies.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.480]   "We call them small-scale societies."
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.680]   - So nothing can be called traditional?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.520]   - I don't know.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.720]   - Is bacteria the traditional society?
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.480]   - Yeah, I think it's just one of these things,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.120]   the language, the words that are deemed appropriate
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.760]   to use to describe things change over time.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.360]   - Yeah, so words can hurt people.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.040]   They can inspire people.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.680]   Words are funny, powerful things.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.440]   You authored a textbook titled "Evolutionary Psychology,
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.920]   "the New Science of Mind" in its sixth edition.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.320]   What is the magic ingredient
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.920]   that gave birth to homo sapiens, do you think?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.360]   Is it fire, cooking, ability to collaborate,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.920]   share ideas, ability to contemplate our own mortality,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.760]   all that kind of stuff?
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.920]   - Yeah, well, I think it's hard to isolate one factor.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.480]   I know you've had Richard Wrangham on this podcast.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.520]   It was a wonderful, wonderful interview.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.640]   He used to be a colleague of mine
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.720]   when I was a professor at Michigan.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.240]   I've stayed in touch with him.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.200]   He's a brilliant, brilliant guy.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.360]   And he thinks fire and cooking
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.760]   have been one of the key things.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.360]   But I think it's hard to isolate.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.720]   I would trace at least part of our uniqueness
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.040]   to the uniqueness of our mating system.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.360]   So we have in mating,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   unlike chimpanzees, who are our closest primate relative,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.480]   and of which Richard Wrangham is a world's expert,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   but they have basically no long-term pair-bonded mating.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   Female comes into estrus, all the mating,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.560]   all the sex happens, most of the sex happens
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.360]   during that window.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   But humans have evolved long-term pair-bonded mating.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.880]   And it's only one mating strategy,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.280]   but it's a really important one.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.960]   And then you have with that male parental care.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.720]   So basically, again, you go back to chimps,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   and chimps, with whom we share more than 98% of our DNA,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.520]   males don't do anything.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.680]   So they inseminate the females,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.800]   but then when the kids are born,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.960]   they basically don't do much of anything
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.400]   in terms of provisioning and so forth.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.880]   But human males do.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.280]   We invest in the modern environment,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.600]   could be decades, especially with the Boomerang kids
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.720]   and everything, but we're, not all males do,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.480]   but compared to the vast majority of mammals,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   we are a very heavy male parental investment species.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.440]   - Could you, if it's okay,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   and I'll ask you a bunch of dumb basic questions,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.280]   'cause those are fun, could you define mating here?
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   Does mating refer to the series of sexual acts
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.000]   that lead to reproduction?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.460]   Does it include dating and love and camaraderie,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.080]   loyalty, all those things?
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.480]   - Yes, I, you know-- - Yes.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.200]   - Yeah, when I first started studying it,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.800]   yeah, I don't, when I first started studying it,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.120]   I looked for the right term.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.320]   And obviously, it's much broader than sex.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   So by mating, I include things like mate selection,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.600]   mate preferences, mate attraction, mate retention,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.680]   mate poaching, mate expulsion.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.360]   - Mate poaching, that sounds fun.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.480]   So the early, the game theoretic strategy
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.040]   of mate selection is primarily what mating is about,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.960]   or do you include the long-term,
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.880]   once you agree that you're gonna stick this out
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.680]   for a while and have multiple children,
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   is that also mating?
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.960]   - Yes, I include that as well.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.840]   So it's a broad-- - Broad category.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.360]   - Broad definition, and absolutely includes
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.920]   the emotion of love.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.320]   And of course, there are many different types of love,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.200]   brotherly love, love of parents for children.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.140]   But love, I think, and this is one of the shifts
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.320]   in the social sciences.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.080]   So when I was an undergraduate, for example,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.960]   I was taught that love is this invention
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.640]   by some Caucasian European poets a couple hundred years ago.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.040]   And it turns out that's not the case.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.920]   So there's been extensive cross-cultural evidence now
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   that people, not every person in all cultures, of course,
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.500]   but some people in all cultures experience this emotion
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.840]   that we call love.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.240]   - And for the word love, are we going to,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.400]   in this conversation, try to stick to sort of romantic love
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.000]   for the meaning of the word love?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.640]   - Well, that's a great question.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.480]   But I mean, it's pretty well established
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   that there are these different phases of love.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   So there's this infatuation phase where our psychology,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.160]   we get obsessional thoughts.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.960]   It's hard to focus on work when we're not with the person
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.200]   we're thinking about, the other person constantly.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.120]   So there's kind of like ideational intrusion
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.280]   into our psychology, but you can't sustain that.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.640]   I mean, it'd be, and then of course,
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.560]   there's a, pardon the phrase,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.120]   but what I described as the fucking like bunnies phase
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.300]   of this intense sexuality.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.240]   But people have other adaptive problems they have to solve.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.640]   And so you can't stay in that state for too long.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.960]   And so that subsides over time
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   and develops into, at least in many cases,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.240]   this warm attachment.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.960]   - Cuddling bunnies, long-term cuddling bunnies.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.800]   - Yes.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.180]   - Phase of the relationship, but still romantic,
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.240]   not like brotherly love or, you know,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.880]   'cause I talk about love a lot.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.560]   And for me, you know, love is a broader experience
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   of just experiencing the joy and the beauty of love
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.680]   and the beauty of life.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   So like just looking out in nature,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.200]   that's the kind of love, like whatever the chemicals
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.760]   that lead to a feeling that at least echoes
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.440]   the same kind of feeling that you get with romantic love,
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.640]   you can experience that with even inanimate objects.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.460]   That sounds weird to say,
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.020]   but just a gratitude and appreciation,
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.040]   not in some kind of a weird Zen way,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.440]   but just in a very human way.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.720]   Just, it feels good to be alive kind of feeling.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess I would,
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.560]   I mean, that's an interesting thought.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.520]   I hadn't thought about that.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.600]   I guess I would use other terms to describe that.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.320]   So like the term awe, for example,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.840]   when you see a beautiful sunset, you know,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.240]   that's why I kind of started out by saying,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.600]   I think there are different types of love
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   and I'm focusing on the mating type.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.320]   - And we'll talk about that.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.000]   But so yeah, there is a sense of beauty
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.620]   and there's a sense of sexual appeal.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.920]   Maybe that's a good, and those intersect
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.760]   in fascinating ways.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   We'll talk about all of that.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.040]   But you're saying mating strategies,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.560]   not that we've kind of placed ourself
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.440]   on what we mean by mating.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.920]   Mating strategies is one of the cool features
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.760]   that made humans what they are.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.600]   One of the initial inventions
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.000]   is the weird and wonderful ways that we mate.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   - Yeah, and I mean, if you go to even things
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.080]   like how we compete for mates,
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.640]   and this is another kind of strange,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.500]   for some people, angle on it,
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.000]   but mating is inherently a competitive process
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.880]   in that desirable mates are in scarce supply
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.920]   relative to the numbers of people who want them.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   And so even post-mating, that is after mate selection,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.760]   mate attraction, and mutual mate choice,
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.840]   desirable, that's why there's mate poaching.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.140]   Mate poaching is one of the strategies
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.980]   that we in my lab with David Schmidt have studied.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.800]   And so, okay, but one of the unique aspects
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.380]   of humans is that we compete using language.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.120]   And that is we have reputations,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.180]   and humans devote a lot of effort
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.760]   to maintaining the reputations,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.380]   to building the reputations,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.600]   to trying to recover reputations
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.500]   after a loss of reputation for various reasons.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.880]   But we compete for mates using language,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.840]   and that includes sending signals
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.960]   to the person that we're trying to attract using language,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.320]   verbal fluency, and obviously
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.280]   some more recent things like poetry.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.300]   But also we use language to derogate our competitors.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.140]   So one of the papers I published very early on,
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.140]   it was a research project on derogation of competitors,
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.540]   the ways in which people impugn the status,
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.940]   character, and reputations of their rivals
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.540]   with the goal of making them less desirable to other people.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.500]   And humans do that, and women and men both do that.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.860]   So it's an interesting thing that we're,
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.600]   male competitions, we were talking about
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.840]   the Yanomamo earlier, and some of these overt physical,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.540]   or what animal biologists call contest competition,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.900]   where there's a physical battle.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.760]   Males do that, and so a lot of the early attention
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.240]   on mate competition was focused on
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.880]   these sort of ostentatious overt battles
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.840]   in contest competition.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.480]   But we compete through language,
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.320]   and so there's this big overlooked domain of women,
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.640]   the ways in which women compete with each other
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.520]   using language.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.540]   And one of the things that astonished me
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.540]   is how observant women are about the subtle imperfections
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.760]   in their rivals and take pains to point them out.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   So just as a random example, I went to a party,
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.840]   this is back in my youth, but went to a party
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   with my girlfriend at the time.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.940]   And I got into this conversation with another woman
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.140]   who happened to be very attractive.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.480]   But then we leave the party, and she said something
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.720]   just casually offhanded, like, she said,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.120]   "Did you notice that her thighs were heavy?"
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.160]   And I hadn't, but next time I saw this other woman,
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.200]   I found my attention being drawn to check out her thigh.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.560]   Well, and originally it puzzled me
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.600]   why women would derogate other women on appearance.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.680]   Well, they do it, of course,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.580]   because men prioritize appearance.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.960]   But I thought, well, the man can see the woman directly
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.480]   with his own eyes.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.200]   Why would verbal input alter his perceptions
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.720]   of how attractive he was?
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.760]   And I think that part of it is,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.000]   I think there are actually two quick answers to that.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.280]   One is the attentional one.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.320]   So our attentional field,
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.960]   when they draw attention to it,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.520]   those what could be very small deviations
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.600]   from perfect symmetry or whatever they are
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.680]   become magnified in our attentional field.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   But the other is that who we have as a mate
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.240]   is also a reflection of our own status.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.160]   And you saw this in a kind of overt and way
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   in the 2016 presidential election,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.840]   where Donald Trump was saying,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.240]   this was when he was in competition with Ted Cruz,
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.920]   I think, in the primary, he said,
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.280]   "Look at my wife, look at Ted Cruz's wife."
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.200]   And he really impugned the appearance of Ted Cruz's wife.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   - So using language, you can alter the dynamics
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.560]   of the social hierarchy, the status hierarchy, sorry.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.280]   So you can change the values subtly,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.240]   or if you have a large platform in big ways,
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.760]   you can move things around just with your words.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.440]   - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.480]   - Right, which is fascinating.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.200]   Because it's all socially constructed anyway.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.440]   So this, I mean, the question I have is,
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.800]   you said there's the interesting thing
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.000]   about mating strategies is there's a small pool
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.960]   of desirable mates.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   And what the word desirable means is socially defined
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.400]   almost by on purpose to make sure
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.360]   the pool always stays small.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.920]   - I would have a couple thoughts on that.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.720]   It's an interesting issue, set of issues you raise.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   Okay, one is that I think we have evolved adaptations.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.580]   Part of our psychology is to detect differences.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.920]   And so this is why, like a, I don't know,
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.840]   a Martian or an alien coming down,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.480]   they might look at humans and say,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.920]   "Boy, they all look alike."
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.320]   Just like we look at, I don't know, zebras or whatever,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.160]   and we think they all look alike.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.000]   But what's important in decision-making,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.120]   especially in the mating domain, or even friendship domain,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   or coalitional selection domain, is the differences.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.200]   And so I noticed this, just a concrete example of this.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.200]   I was sitting around, this is, again, ages ago,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.400]   watching something like a Miss America beauty contest,
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.680]   and people in there with a bunch of other people,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.520]   and they were saying, "Boy, did you see Miss North Carolina?
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.720]   "What a dog."
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.080]   And so this is astonishing.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.440]   So here are like 50 contestants who are selected
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.420]   as the most attractive in their state, presumably,
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.640]   although they claim it's based on talent.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.620]   But we notice the differences.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:45.320]   And this is why I would push back a little bit
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.080]   on the term socially constructed,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.600]   because I think there are many different meanings
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.080]   of that phrase.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.280]   And one meaning that some people have,
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.920]   one connotation is that it's arbitrary.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.300]   And I don't think it's arbitrary.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.280]   So this has been another shift
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   in understanding standards of beauty,
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.680]   where it used to be believed in the social sciences.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.400]   You can't judge a book by its cover.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.000]   Beauty is only skin deep.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.840]   Don't judge people on the superficial characteristics.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.640]   But in fact, physical appearance provides
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.200]   a wealth of information about the health status
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.660]   of someone there, in the case of males,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.000]   their physical formidability.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.280]   And we have formidability assessment adaptations.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.320]   And then fertility as well.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.120]   So there are a very predictable set of cues to fertility
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.960]   that have evolved to be part of our standards
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.920]   of attractiveness.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.840]   And they're not arbitrary.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.800]   There are some culturally arbitrary ones.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.920]   So like you go to the Maori in New Zealand, for example,
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.640]   and they find tattoos on their lips to be very attractive.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.720]   So there are some culturally arbitrary things.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.920]   But standards of beauty like cues to youth,
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   cues to health in women, clear skin, full lips,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:17.160]   clear eyes, lustrous hair, a small waist-hip ratio
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.440]   that is circumference of the waist relative to the hips
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.740]   is a cue to youth and fertility,
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.680]   and a cue to health.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.000]   Symmetrical features.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.580]   So we are a bilaterally symmetrical species,
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.240]   but we all have deviations from perfect symmetry
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.320]   that are due to different things.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.040]   So mutation, load, environmental insults,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.120]   diseases during development, and so forth.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.680]   - All right, but that's kind of deeply biological.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.460]   Like there's cues that indicate something
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.640]   that is biologically true about a particular human.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.600]   So if we talk about both men and women.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.640]   So we're now talking about what men want
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.240]   in the mating strategies when they look at women.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.560]   So you're saying small waist to hip ratio.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.400]   - Right.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:18.020]   - How much of that is our deep biological past
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.400]   on top of which we can build
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.720]   all kinds of different standards of beauty?
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.220]   So we have many things going on in our brain.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.220]   Our value of other humans in selecting a mate
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.260]   might incorporate a lot more variables
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.700]   as we get into the 21st century.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.700]   So how quickly does our valuation of a mate evolve
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:49.020]   relative to the evolution of the human species?
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.700]   - You're using evolve in the sense of culturally evolve?
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.100]   - Culturally evolve, and then relative
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.700]   to biologically evolve.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.700]   - Yeah, well, I think that there are some things
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.340]   that are biologically evolved,
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.300]   some standards of attractiveness.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   And there are some of the things that I mentioned.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.060]   So in male evaluation of females,
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.940]   let me back up and just say,
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.400]   what is the underlying logic?
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.340]   Why would we have standards of attractiveness?
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.020]   So here's the interesting thing,
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.940]   and this gets back to your earlier question
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.500]   about what is unique to humans,
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.340]   or what distinguishes us,
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.000]   or what set us off on the path that we did,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   is chimpanzee males do not have any difficulty
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.620]   figuring out when a female is fertile.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.020]   She signals that like crazy
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.860]   with the bright red genital swelling,
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.640]   olfactory cues, she goes into estrus.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.600]   In humans, we have, and this was actually a third thing
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.100]   that I wanted to add earlier,
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.780]   we have concealed ovulation, okay,
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.700]   relatively concealed ovulation,
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.620]   which is remarkable given how close we are
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.660]   primatologically to chimpanzees.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.660]   And so there's a little bit of evidence
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.620]   that there are subtle changes that occur
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.980]   when women ovulate, women not on hormonal contraceptives.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.260]   - But it's mostly concealed.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.860]   - But it is largely concealed.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.340]   - Do you think that's a feature or a bug?
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.840]   Like do we evolve that, is that a cool,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.000]   a powerful invention for the human species?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.980]   - I think it's an adaptation in women,
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.260]   that women have evolved concealed ovulation.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.940]   And I think it's a feature, not a bug.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.980]   - That gives more, would it give more power
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.980]   for women to select a mate?
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.620]   - There are a couple different hypotheses about it,
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.300]   but the one that I think is most plausible
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.000]   is that, again, comparing it to chimps,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.340]   female goes into estrus, the male just has to try
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.260]   to monopolize her while she's in that estrus phase,
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.780]   and then they basically ignore the females after that.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.460]   If you can't know when a woman is fertile,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.700]   then you have to stick around a lot longer.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.420]   And so I think long-term pair bonding co-evolved
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.300]   with concealed ovulation.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.920]   And with that, also, a very different form of sexuality,
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.380]   which is that we have sex throughout the ovulatory cycle,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.100]   and chimps don't.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.660]   There's a little bit of mating, a little bit of sex
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.980]   toward the edges of the estrus cycle, but very little.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.020]   - So that actually makes mating a more fundamental part
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.380]   of interaction between humans than it does for chimps.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.900]   So meaning like year-round, every day,
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.780]   constantly selecting mates in terms of biologically speaking.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.500]   So what else do men want?
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   Today, in the 21st century, versus in the caveman days?
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.380]   - A wonderful question.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.500]   To answer it, though, I have to distinguish
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.820]   between long-term mating and short-term mating.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.740]   And in long-term mating, it gets very complicated.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.620]   So as a--
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.980]   - That's one way to put it, yeah.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.820]   - Well, so I teach a course in human sexuality
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.140]   at University of Texas at Austin.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.660]   And one of the things, this is back in the days
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.500]   when there were chalkboards, and you taught
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.780]   with a piece of chalk and wrote things on the board.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.740]   And what I would do is I would ask the class,
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.540]   I'd teach this large class, one to 200,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.020]   I'd say, what do women want?
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.380]   Tell me all the things women want in a long-term mate.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.340]   And so I would start at one end of the blackboard,
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.940]   there were like five blackboards, and I'd say,
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.360]   well, I want a mate who's kind, who's understanding,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.540]   who's intelligent, who's healthy,
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.860]   who's got a good sense of humor, who shares my values.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.460]   And I'd just go, and I'd fill up five blackboards
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.300]   and then run out of space.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.420]   And so first, this large number of characteristics
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.180]   that people want, and then specific magnitudes
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.220]   of those characteristics or amounts.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.180]   So I'd say, you want a mate who's, say, generous
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.140]   with their resources, and they'd say, yes,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.660]   I want a mate who's generous with their resources.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.820]   So I said, so like a guy who, this is in women's mate
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.340]   selection, a guy who, at the end of every month,
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.500]   gets his paycheck and gives it to the local wino
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.180]   on the drag, and I'd say, well, no, not that generous.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.260]   Generous toward me, not indiscriminately generous.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.460]   And so you want a mate who's ambitious,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.060]   who's a hard worker, yes, but not a workaholic.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.940]   And so then you get to interactions
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.980]   among different characteristics.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.580]   - So there's a lot of characteristics, a lot of variables
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.560]   in this very complex optimization problem for women.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.380]   - Yes, that's right, and more so for women than for men.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.780]   So then I turn to the men, and I say,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.580]   well, what do men want, and then I run out of space
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.180]   after about a blackboard and a half,
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.820]   'cause they can't think of anything else.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.220]   So women-- - I think there's a lot
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.720]   of explanations for that.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.620]   Besides the lack of the number of variables, it's also,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.220]   you know, I mean, that's interesting.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.100]   So what's the difference between the variables?
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.780]   So on the men's side, what are the variables?
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.220]   - Well, in long-term mate selection,
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.100]   there's a lot of overlap.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.980]   - Sure. - Okay.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.180]   So things like intelligence, good health,
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.820]   sense of humor, an agreeable personality,
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.820]   someone who's not too neurotic or moody
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.540]   or emotionally volatile,
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.420]   but there are key differences as well.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.380]   And the differences stem from,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.780]   they basically fall in the delimited number of domains.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.180]   So for men, it's physical attractiveness,
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.740]   physical appearance, and youth are the two real big ones.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.220]   Okay, men prioritize those more than women do.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.700]   And so that's why you have phenomena such as this,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.980]   I'll quote, "Love at first sight,"
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.580]   where sometimes men can walk into a party
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.060]   and they see a woman across the room,
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.880]   and they say, "I'm gonna marry that woman.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.260]   "That's the woman for me."
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.380]   Women very rarely do that.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.020]   Now, most men don't do that either,
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.860]   but men are much more inclined to fall in love
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.180]   at first sight, that's because they prioritize
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.780]   physical appearance.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.620]   Why?
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.380]   Because physical appearance provides this wealth
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.220]   of information about a woman's fertility status.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.340]   And this is from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.060]   from a purely reproductive perspective,
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.860]   in business school, they would call it job one.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.280]   Job one is you have to select a fertile mate.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.460]   So those who, in our evolutionary past,
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.820]   who selected infertile mates,
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.400]   so postmenopausal women, for example,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.300]   did not become our ancestors.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.660]   So we are all the descendants of this long
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.420]   and unbroken chain of ancestors,
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.980]   all of whom succeeded in selecting a fertile mate.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.600]   But fertility cannot be observed directly.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.300]   - It can use some cues.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.740]   - Exactly, and there are cues that are probabilistically
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.620]   related to this underlying quality of fertility
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.340]   that we can't observe directly.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.400]   - And we're doing that computation in our heads.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.180]   What about men?
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.380]   What do men want for short-term mating?
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.140]   - Well, so for short-term mating,
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:45.460]   for both sexes, physical appearance looms very large.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:50.980]   So women are, no, physical attractiveness and appearance,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.420]   they're important for women in long-term mate selection.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.940]   So I don't wanna mislead anyone on that.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.820]   They're just not as important as they are for men.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.520]   And so a lot of characteristics come for women
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.540]   before physical appearance, physical attractiveness.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.740]   - So women, so if we switch to women,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.780]   what do women want?
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.780]   They want also physical appearance for short-term mating,
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.740]   physical attractiveness, what else?
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.700]   - Well-- - Some cues that represent
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.420]   physical attractiveness that maybe represent health.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.020]   - Well, here's, this is your--
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.980]   - I'm learning a lot here.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.820]   - Yeah, well, so, but you're also asking
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:37.140]   a very interesting question about what is controversial
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.700]   within the evolutionary psychology field, right,
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.380]   and not totally resolved.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.460]   So-- - That's why you're
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.020]   on the sixth edition of the book,
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.540]   and there could be a lot more editions coming.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.780]   - Yeah, I revise it every four years or so
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:55.180]   because there's four years of new, interesting work,
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.660]   and so it deserves updating.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.600]   But the traditional, I should say,
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.900]   answer to your question is that women go for good genes,
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.380]   cues to good genes in the short-term,
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.740]   and cues to resources in the long-term.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.740]   And this has been a hypothesis that advocated,
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.500]   I didn't come up with this one,
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.220]   by Steve Gangestad, a former student of mine,
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.140]   Marty Hale, Randy Thornhill,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.580]   and some other very smart players in the field.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.580]   And what they used as markers of good genes
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:38.580]   are things like symmetrical features and masculine features.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.860]   So strong jawline, high shoulder-to-hip ratio,
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.780]   other sorts of masculine features.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.540]   But I started to doubt this explanation
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.780]   for what women want in the short-term
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.180]   because of some other findings.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.500]   So for women, a lot of short-term mating
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.700]   is not one-night-stand mating,
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.540]   but rather it's affair mating.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:14.500]   So if you ask the question, why do women have affairs?
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   So let's restrict the question for the moment.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.380]   My colleagues would argue, well, women have affairs
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.180]   because they're trying to get good genes from one guy
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.780]   while they're getting investment from the regular partner,
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.500]   the husband.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.340]   Okay, but the problem is that when women have affairs,
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.980]   70-plus percent tend to fall in love with
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.060]   or become attached to their affair partner.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.860]   - Oh, sorry, what percentage, 70?
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.700]   - Yeah, 70--
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.700]   - A large majority.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.420]   - Yeah, 70% or more.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.900]   In contrast to men, where it's more like 30%
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.580]   of men who have affairs fall in love with
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.180]   or become attached to their affair partner.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.740]   But from a design perspective,
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.540]   an engineering perspective, if you will,
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.900]   that's a disastrous thing
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.340]   if you're just trying to get good genes.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.340]   So you're trying to retain the investment of one guy
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.460]   while getting good genes surreptitiously
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.460]   from this guy who presumably has more.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.780]   Falling in love with them, becoming attached,
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.180]   that's not a feature you want.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.980]   - Yeah, it's bad engineering.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.820]   - Yeah, exactly, it's bad engineering.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.860]   And so I developed an alternative hypothesis
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.460]   that I call the mate-switching hypothesis,
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.940]   which is that affairs are one way
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.540]   in which women divest themselves
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.820]   of a cost-inflicting partner
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.660]   or a partner who things aren't working out well with.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.620]   And it's a way to either transition back
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:52.380]   into the mating market or to trade up in the mating market.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.540]   And so, anyway, so these are probably
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.140]   the two leading hypotheses about why women have affairs.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.140]   And I am putting my money on the mate-switching hypothesis.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.140]   My esteemed colleagues are putting their money
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.580]   on the good genes hypothesis.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.940]   But I think the evidence for the good genes hypothesis
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:17.260]   is starting to look shakier than initially.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.540]   - Well, this is a heated debate.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.940]   I mean, mate-switching sounds like a,
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.740]   so from a game theory perspective,
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.860]   from an engineering perspective,
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.500]   it seems to make a lot more sense,
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.220]   unless you put a lot of value in lifelong,
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.200]   sort of in the long-term mating,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:37.340]   some kind of value in the lifelong singular relationship
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.100]   like monogamy.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.620]   - Yeah.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.300]   - And maybe we do, psychologically.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.660]   Maybe there's a big evolutionary advantage to that.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.700]   - And we do, but we also know that divorce is,
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.180]   you know, and breakups are also common
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.740]   and occur in all cultures.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.580]   So that's--
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.740]   - Yeah, we're just not very good at this thing.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.300]   Well, either we're not good at the mate selection,
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:06.140]   such that maybe we're not incorporating
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.580]   all the variables well,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.020]   or we're just not good at monogamy, period,
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.180]   from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.740]   - Well, I think there, that's--
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.780]   - Another debate?
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.300]   - No, that raises an interesting set of questions.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.540]   So I think that, I mean, one issue is longevity.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.540]   So, I mean, we didn't live to be 70, 80 years old
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:35.260]   in over 99% of human evolutionary history.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:40.020]   And so we didn't necessarily evolve to be mated monogamously
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.060]   with one person for decades and decades and decades.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.340]   But I also think that long-term peer bonding
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.780]   is a critical strategy,
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.340]   but mate switching is also a critical strategy.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.100]   So if you have a mate, for example,
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.060]   who becomes cost-inflicting
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.060]   or becomes sufficiently debilitated
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:07.020]   or who suffers an injury such that,
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.780]   like in hunter-gatherer societies
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.860]   where the mate can no longer hunt,
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.540]   can no longer provide resources
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.300]   for their kids and the woman,
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.460]   this becomes a problem.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.860]   And so I think that we have adaptations to mate switch
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.900]   and to divest ourselves from some partners
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.300]   and trade up in the mating market
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.140]   under certain conditions.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.140]   - So, okay.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.340]   - And those conditions will differ for men and women.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.920]   - What are some of the cues in terms of what women want?
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.580]   You know, I go to the gym.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.300]   It's a hotly contested debate.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.980]   You said evolutionary psychology,
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.300]   and this is in the bro psychology forums
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.980]   that I visit multiple times a day.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.980]   What's the most important cue of appearance for guys?
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.500]   What muscle group is the most important to work on?
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.980]   Do women care about biceps is what I'm asking.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.700]   - In terms of physical appearance,
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:12.820]   a good shoulder to hip ratio,
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.820]   so relatively wide shoulders relative to hips is one.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:24.100]   Women tend to prefer men who are physically fit
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.100]   and well-toned but not muscle-bound.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.020]   So, like if you go to, I don't know,
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.340]   some of those early,
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.740]   when Arnold Schwarzenegger was doing the Mr.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.540]   whatever it was contest,
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.020]   you see the women don't find those attractive,
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.620]   the extremely muscle-bound guys,
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.300]   but they like a guy who's physically fit,
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.540]   high shoulder to hip ratio.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.900]   They like guys who are physically taller than they are
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.460]   and guys who are a bit above average in height.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   So, if the average is, I don't know,
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.700]   five nine, five 10 and up there for humans,
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.180]   depending on the culture,
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.360]   women prefer an inch or two taller than that.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:20.340]   - So, shoulders, height, dad bod, what's that about?
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.820]   Why do you want a dad bod?
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.060]   How do I define dad bod?
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.300]   - What is a dad bod?
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.260]   - Dad bod is not muscle-bound.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.820]   - Okay, so out of shape.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.180]   - No, no, just a little bit.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.340]   A little bit of a cushion for the pushing.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.820]   I don't know what the kids call it these days,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.480]   but just a little bit, a little bit of fat.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.660]   So, why do they not want guys to be obsessed
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.500]   with their body?
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.660]   Is that, or is that some evolutionary thing?
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:54.660]   - Yeah, I think that women might interpret a guy
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:00.300]   who is so obsessed with his body that he's,
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.820]   they might view that as a sign of darn narcissism.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.340]   - Yes.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.340]   - And that's not a good trait.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.660]   - What about cultures where large,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.900]   sort of overweight men are valued?
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.020]   Is that, how do you explain,
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.980]   like how much can we override the evolutionary desires
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.300]   with our sort of cultural fashions of the day
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.100]   that maybe represent other desirable aspects like wealth?
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:32.020]   - Well, wealth is, resources have always been important,
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.460]   especially to women.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.460]   So, is a man able to acquire resources,
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.660]   and is he willing to dispense them to her and her kids?
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.260]   So, that's always important.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:48.260]   In traditional cultures, that boils down to hunting skills.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.940]   So, if, so I asked a colleague, friend, Kim Hill,
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.980]   who's probably the world's leading expert
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.500]   on the Ache of Paraguay,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.900]   and you ask him like what leads to high status
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.700]   in the Ache in males, hunting skills.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.020]   That's the one thing, the big variable.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.500]   - And that's resources.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.020]   - And that's resources.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.580]   Now, what's interesting about modern culture
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.660]   is we have cash economies,
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.620]   but cash economies are relatively recent.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.700]   And historically, there's over the vast,
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.340]   99% of human evolutionary history,
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.700]   you weren't able to stockpile resources
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.700]   in the way that you are today.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:35.340]   Although there are interestingly certain ways you can do it.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.380]   So, like you kill a large game animal, okay?
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.020]   You bring it back, you get some status points
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.860]   because you give some to your family,
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.600]   you can share it more widely with the group, et cetera.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.400]   But it's gonna go bad, right?
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.160]   You can't just say, I'm gonna keep this carcass around
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.040]   for the next several months, okay?
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.560]   But, and I think it's a Steve Pinker
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.160]   who might've used to coin this phrase
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.680]   that they store the meat in the bodies of other people.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.160]   And so, for example, they store it in their friends.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.480]   So, you know, hunting success is,
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.600]   you know, it's a hit or miss kind of thing.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.520]   So, you might come back empty handed four times out of five,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.840]   but when you do, you share your meat with others.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.200]   And then when, you know, and then they reciprocate
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.360]   by sharing their meat with you.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.960]   And so, you can store resources
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.760]   in the bodies of other people,
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.240]   which is I think an interesting way to think about it.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.880]   But that can only go so far.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.860]   And when you have cash economies,
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.240]   you have both the ability to stockpile resources,
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   but also this kind of explosion and inequality of resources.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.160]   And that's evolutionarily recent.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.000]   - What about, now this is the difference
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.760]   between the Huberman, the excellent Huberman Lab podcast
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.840]   that you did that people should listen to.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.920]   He is a brilliant scientist,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   a sort of a rigorous analyst of what is true
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.440]   in the scientific community.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.400]   Also helps you with great advice on how to live.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   Now, in contrast to that, I am a terrible,
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.320]   almost idiotic level journalist.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.600]   So, this is what you have to deal with.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.640]   Another thing that people talk about
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.160]   that women care about is penis size.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.940]   Does penis size matter for women in sexual selection?
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.640]   - Well, there's controversy about that.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.400]   - In the evolution of psychology community?
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.960]   - Well, I-- - Is there papers on penis size?
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.600]   - I wouldn't say scientific papers,
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.240]   so speculations about-- - Sure.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.320]   So, not in nature or in science?
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.940]   - Yeah, yeah, no, nothing that I've seen there.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:56.960]   I think that there's individual variability.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.440]   So, this is something that comes up again.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.520]   When I ask women in my classes, what do women want?
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.680]   Some will say, a large penis.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:11.320]   But I think there's variability in that preference.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.440]   And it also might depend in part on the variability
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.960]   in the woman's anatomy.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.560]   - Do you think there's something fundamental
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.680]   in terms of evolutionary psychology, in terms of evolution?
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.240]   Or is this a quirk of culture that's current,
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.800]   that's maybe somehow connected to pornography
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.640]   or something like that?
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.000]   - Yeah, my guess is it's something
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.840]   that's perhaps a quirk of culture
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   or something that is evolutionarily recent.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.800]   But I don't know.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.360]   I mean, it's a topic that hasn't been explored much.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.760]   I've never done work on it.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.880]   - Well, somebody should do a PhD,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.680]   some archeologist should do a PhD
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.560]   on the history of human civilization
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.280]   and its valuation of penis size
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.020]   and the correlation of penis size to the value of the male.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.160]   Okay, moving on.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.120]   Another absurd question in terms of what men want.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.940]   Again, definitely not a Huberman Lab podcast question.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:20.640]   Why do men, let's say a large fraction of men, love boobs?
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.160]   - Well, I think that--
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.440]   - You're one of the most cited evolutionary psychologists
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.720]   and this is what you signed up for,
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.560]   these kinds of questions.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.840]   - Questions like this, yeah.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.420]   Well, so again, this is something
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:40.420]   I haven't studied directly, but scientifically.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.820]   - Yes, yes.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.220]   - But yeah, there's been some work on that.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.180]   - Another cultural quirk, perhaps?
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.900]   - No, I don't think it's a cultural quirk
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.860]   because I think it's the shape that matters a lot
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.220]   because shape is gonna be a cue to fertility.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:03.580]   So one of the things that humans are attracted to
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:07.280]   in the opposite sex is sexually dimorphic features
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.500]   and breasts are a sexually dimorphic feature.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.700]   - What's dimorphic mean?
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:16.700]   - Difference in morphology between males and females.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.220]   - Got it.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.960]   - Diming to morphic morphology.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:28.540]   And women don't develop breasts until puberty
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.000]   or post-puberty.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.020]   And so as a sexually dimorphic characteristic,
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.060]   we tend to be attracted to that.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.460]   Same is true, by the way, with the waist to hip ratio
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.420]   that we mentioned earlier.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.460]   Prior to puberty, males and females
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.980]   have very similar waist to hip ratios.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:50.980]   But at puberty, there's a differential hip development
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.940]   and fat deposition that creates a sexual dimorphism
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.180]   with respect to waist to hip ratio.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.900]   And so again, men are attracted to this waist to hip ratio.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.700]   No man consciously says that.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.060]   They find this woman more attractive than that woman.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.260]   They don't think, ah, she has a waist to hip ratio of .70.
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.100]   That's true.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.140]   - That's exactly what I do, but most men, most men, yes.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.900]   So isn't that fascinating that we just build
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.100]   these entire industries of fashion
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:26.100]   and what we find beautiful around these kinds of ideas?
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:30.140]   And we just, and then not just fashion,
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:35.140]   and then we build, we have sociological tensions
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.340]   about whether we should care about this kind of thing or not.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.460]   There's battles in that space.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:44.260]   It's like, they seem so simple.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.340]   It's just the human body.
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.820]   And we wear clothes, first of all.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.700]   That's a funny thing.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.380]   What's the, why are we wearing clothes?
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.660]   What's the shame aspect of covering up the body?
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.420]   Is that another feature, or is that, what is that?
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.020]   - Yeah, that's an interesting question, and I don't know.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.900]   It's just like hiding ovulation.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.140]   Maybe that's another hiding.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.660]   Like, maybe hiding is a great game theoretic thing
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.460]   to play with, 'cause it can give you,
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.700]   it can give the powerless more power by covering, maybe.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.100]   - Well, I think there are a few things.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.500]   So one is the sort of arbitrary features of fashion,
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.580]   and then the other is the aspects of fashion
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   that attempt to magnify what is inherent
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.500]   in our evolved standards of beauty.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:33.300]   So for example, women tend to wear things
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.760]   that accentuate their waist-hip ratio.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.420]   So, I mean, historically, those,
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.220]   in the old days, corsets, for example,
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.420]   cinched the woman's waist.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:50.180]   And you wouldn't see fashion develop in a way
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:55.180]   that made a woman seem old, unhealthy,
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.180]   or pockmarked signs of open sores or lesions.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:05.340]   There are certain domains, design spaces,
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.220]   that you wouldn't, that no culture would develop.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.340]   So, but there are arbitrary features,
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.620]   but sometimes they're not entirely arbitrary,
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.940]   or they're arbitrary at one level of description,
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.380]   but not at another.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.380]   So for example, fashion tends to be linked with status,
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.940]   and that's why it constantly changes.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.540]   The high-status people start wearing
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.420]   a certain type of clothing,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.820]   and then when the lower-status people imitate them,
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:37.380]   then they have to shift to signal their status.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.660]   And so I think the fashion and clothing
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.380]   is in part linked to status.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.980]   - So this is not you talking, this is me.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.660]   I just wanna make a statement, a profound statement,
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.420]   that I think yoga pants, now this is broadly speaking,
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.580]   but yoga pants is one of the greatest inventions
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:54.420]   in human history.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.260]   There's fire, and yoga, and I'm just gonna leave it there.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:02.380]   I'm a fan, and I have female friends
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.260]   that talk about how comfortable yoga pants are,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.300]   which is what I'm referring to when I say
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.700]   it's one of the greatest inventions,
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.060]   because comfort in fashion is really, really important to me.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.160]   Let me ask about sort of the sociological aspect of this.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.640]   So I've talked to Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:27.140]   the meta who's the CEO, founder of Facebook,
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.820]   and now meta and owns Instagram.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:29.940]   - Right, I've heard of him.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.900]   - Yeah, he's a, yeah. (laughs)
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:37.900]   He holds the American flag and likes the water.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:43.020]   Anyway, so there's been criticisms
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.740]   of social networks and so on,
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.220]   and I just wanna ask you about the broader question here,
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:52.820]   that there's objectification of the human body in the media,
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.860]   and that creates standards for young women,
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:59.020]   for young men, perhaps, but more young women.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.420]   You mentioned to the cruelty that women can have
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.740]   towards each other in terms of,
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.740]   well, let's, you know, cruelty is already a moral judgment.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.180]   Just, you've made a statement about the fact
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:15.180]   that women seem to point out imperfections in other women.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.860]   Do you think it's a problem in our modern society
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.820]   that we objectify each other in this way?
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.820]   Do you think this is a fundamental aspect of our biology
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.860]   that we need to suppress versus celebrate?
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:41.620]   Just like we might suppress our natural desire for violence
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.940]   if such exists in modern society?
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.580]   - Well, a couple thoughts on that.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.540]   I think it is damaging,
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:56.020]   the fact that so many images are displayed in social media,
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.340]   and so what I would say is that there's what's called
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:04.140]   in the field an evolutionary mismatch.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.820]   So we evolved in the context of small group living
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.060]   where there was made competition,
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.700]   but your competitors were a small number
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.020]   of other potential individuals,
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.280]   and so people do comparisons.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:24.380]   But now what we have is this bombardment,
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:29.380]   bombardment of our visual system and our sexual psychology
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:33.700]   and our mating psychology with thousands and thousands
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.460]   of images that are not at all representative
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:42.460]   of who our actual competition is in the mating domain.
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.380]   And so I think that, and there's actually evidence on this
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:51.300]   that Baz Luhrmann actually said something like this
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.780]   in his "Sunscreen Song."
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.140]   I don't know if you ever heard that,
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.900]   but it's like a set of, it's a wonderful string of advice,
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.580]   song about advice, but he says--
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.060]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, sorry.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.740]   - Yeah, he says, "Don't read beauty magazines.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.500]   "They will only make you feel ugly."
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.540]   I think that there's truth to that,
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.420]   that is, especially with women,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.100]   they look at all these images,
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:18.100]   and of course, they're photographed, they're Photoshopped,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:22.860]   they're highly selected and not at all representative,
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.380]   and so women compare themselves to that.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.420]   So I think this social comparison
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.140]   is an evolved feature of humans.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.780]   I mean, males do it, females do it,
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.340]   but it's exacerbated in the modern environment
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.140]   in wildly evolutionarily mismatched ways.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.900]   And so I think that it is destructive, it's harmful.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:47.580]   There's evidence that it hurts women's self-esteem.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:52.580]   So here's just another factoid, or fact, if you will,
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.600]   that at least in Western cultures,
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.300]   males and females have roughly the same
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.260]   overall average levels of self-esteem,
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.820]   but once puberty hits, all of a sudden,
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.140]   women's self-esteem starts to drop,
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.260]   and I think it's because when they enter, make competition,
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:14.500]   then they start elevating the importance
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.140]   they attach to physical appearance,
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:20.820]   and then as you point out, the tremendous objectification
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:24.940]   that saturates social media and media in general,
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   it's damaging and harmful.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.860]   I don't know how to undo it, though.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.060]   I don't know how to design a society that undoes that.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.660]   - Well, one of the ways we undo things,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.500]   just like you pointed out, is we use words.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.460]   When we manipulate society,
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.220]   we manipulate social and status hierarchies
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.460]   using our words for ill, and we can do the same for good,
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.780]   and that's why there's a lot of clickbait articles
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:57.780]   about Instagram leading to a lot of suffering
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:04.880]   amongst teenage girls and all those kinds of things.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.840]   I'm criticizing the clickbait nature,
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.840]   not the contents of the articles,
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.520]   but in those articles, hopefully become viral
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.960]   in a way that makes us rethink
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.720]   about how we build social networks
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.240]   that kind of allow us to too easily misrepresent
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.160]   how we look when we are quote-unquote influencers
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   and what mental effect it has on young people
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.320]   that look up to those influencers,
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.320]   but I guess it's not the objectification fundamentally
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.480]   that's the problem.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.520]   It's the inaccurate, it's the fake news,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.320]   it's the fake news, misrepresentation.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.240]   You still objectify the male body, the female body,
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.000]   but you do so while misrepresenting the actual truth,
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.840]   and so you're moving the average,
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.400]   you're moving the standard representation
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.520]   of what a male should look like,
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.280]   what a woman should look like,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.800]   and the dishonesty's the problem, not the objectification.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.200]   - Here's just one other interesting empirical finding
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   on that, and it has to do with another dimension
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.040]   that I think is harmful, and that's the thinness dimension.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   These are studies originally done by Paul Rosin,
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.320]   but they've been replicated, where if you ask men,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.320]   okay, what is your ideal figure in a woman?
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.480]   And so they have these, say, nine figures
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.240]   that vary from very, very thin to average to plump.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.120]   Men give it the midpoint.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   They say the midpoint is in relative thinness or plumpness
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.800]   is what I value, and you ask women,
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   what is your ideal body type for you?
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:49.120]   They give it, they say thinner, but then if you ask them,
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.440]   what do you think male's ideal body type is?
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.840]   They put it in exactly the same spot
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.200]   that they put their own ideal, which is thin,
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.200]   and so there's actually an inaccurate perception
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.520]   of how thin men desire women to be,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.480]   and I think that's partly exacerbated
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   by the fashion industry, where the models
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   are often real thin, and the lore is that clothes hang better
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.800]   on thin models, and then on TV, they say you gain 15 pounds
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.920]   over what you really are or whatever,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.840]   but for whatever reason, women misperceive
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.000]   how thin men want them to be,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.240]   and so you have, this is another huge sex difference,
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.200]   is eating disorders, anorexia, for example,
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.000]   bulimia, binging, purging, where these eating disorders
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.440]   are nine to 10 times more common in women than in men.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.080]   - Can I just take a small tangent,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.480]   'cause it was such a beautiful, the Sunscreen Song,
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   such a beautiful one, if I can read
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.720]   some of the words from it?
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.200]   - Yeah. - I really enjoy it.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.960]   - Yeah, it's a great song.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.640]   - For people, you should check it out,
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.760]   it's called Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.040]   I guess it's actually a speech to a class,
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.640]   I don't know if that's artificial or real,
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.320]   but it's a speech that gives advice,
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.240]   and it goes, "Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '97,"
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.600]   I just remember it even now, those words,
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.120]   "Where's sunscreen?
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.560]   "If I could offer you only one tip for the future,
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.380]   "sunscreen would be it.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.080]   "The long-term benefits of sunscreen
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.920]   "have been proven by scientists.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.280]   "Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.560]   "than my own meandering experience.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.440]   "I will dispense this advice now.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.280]   "Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.080]   "Oh, nevermind, you will not understand
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.900]   "the power and beauty of your youth until they're faded.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.140]   "But trust me, in 20 years,
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.520]   "you'll look back at the photos of yourself
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.560]   "and recall in a way that you can't grasp now
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.800]   "how much possibility laid before you
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.280]   "and how fabulous you really looked.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.420]   "You are not as fat as you imagine.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.100]   "Don't worry about the future.
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.460]   "Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.480]   "as trying to solve an algebra equation
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.040]   "by chewing bubble gum.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.640]   "The real troubles in your life
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.760]   "are apt to be the things
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.960]   "that never cross your worried mind.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.000]   "The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m.

[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.420]   "'Don't put up with the people
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.380]   "'who are reckless with yours.'
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.820]   "Floss.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.920]   "Don't waste your time on jealousy.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.740]   "Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind.

[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.020]   "If you succeed in doing this, tell me how."
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.440]   (laughing)
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.760]   Keep your old love letters.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.000]   Throw away your old bang statements.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.300]   Stretch.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.200]   Don't feel guilty if you don't know
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.080]   what you want to do with your life.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.240]   The most interesting people I know
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.800]   didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.440]   Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.840]   still don't.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.320]   For me, that's true for 50, 60, and 70-year-olds, honestly.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.720]   Get plenty of calcium.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.280]   Be kind to your niece.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.080]   You'll miss them when they're gone.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.280]   Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.640]   Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.600]   Maybe you'll divorce at 40.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.440]   Maybe you'll dance the funky chicken
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.600]   on your 75th wedding anniversary.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.280]   Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.680]   or berate yourself either.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.720]   Your choices are half chance.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.780]   So are everybody else's.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.280]   Enjoy your body.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.440]   Use it every way you can.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.560]   Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.080]   It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.280]   Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.000]   but in your own living room.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.840]   Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.440]   Do not read beauty magazines
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.000]   that will only make you feel ugly.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.480]   Get to know your parents.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.960]   You never know when they'll be gone for good.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.040]   Be nice to your siblings.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.280]   They're your best link to your past
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.720]   and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.760]   Understand that friends come and go,
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.720]   but a precious few who should hold on.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.200]   Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.400]   For as older you get,
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.640]   the more you need the people you knew when you were young.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.080]   Live in New York City once.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.300]   I actually took this advice.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.560]   This is fascinating advice.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.840]   I remember this advice well.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.600]   It's broadly applied.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.320]   Live in New York City once,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.120]   but leave before it makes you hard.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.040]   Live in Northern California once,
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.760]   but leave before it makes you soft.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.460]   Travel, accept certain inalienable truths.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:55.240]   Prices will rise, politicians will philander,
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.960]   you too will get old.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.320]   And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young,
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.320]   prices were reasonable, politicians were noble,
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.960]   and children respected their elders.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.680]   Respect your elders.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.920]   Don't expect anyone else to support you.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.560]   Maybe you have a trust fund,
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.600]   maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   but you never know when either one might run out.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.840]   Never mess too much with your hair,
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.200]   or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.880]   Be careful whose advice you buy,
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.320]   but be patient with those who supply it.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.200]   Advice is a form of nostalgia.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.720]   Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.880]   from the disposal, wiping it off,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.560]   painting over the ugly parts,
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.240]   and recycling it for more than it's worth.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.840]   But trust me on the sunscreen.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.040]   - So this is, thank you for allowing me to read it.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.640]   It's almost sentimental for me.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.400]   I don't know when I first heard it,
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.860]   but there's a few pieces of advice in that,
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.740]   similar to the poem "If" by Rajat Kipling,
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:01.320]   there's some deep truths when you step back
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.200]   and look at it all.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.680]   And also the places where you live.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.680]   'Cause I lived for a time in, I guess, Northern California
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.200]   with Google and so on.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.760]   And one of the reasons I had to leave
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.360]   is I felt I was becoming soft.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.340]   This is my own personal experience.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:28.360]   And the same is true for the cities of the East.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.480]   They can, if you're not careful, make you hard,
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.340]   'cause everybody's super busy and rushing around,
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:38.000]   and there's just a buzz to the city, which is exciting.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.680]   It's empowering, but it can change you in ways.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.920]   And so it's one of the reasons I'm here in Austin.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.080]   I fell in love with the city,
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:46.920]   'cause it's such a nice, balanced--
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   - Yeah, it's a great move.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.440]   And yeah, I've lived on both coasts as well,
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.600]   Boston area and then Berkeley, California.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.840]   So I'm familiar with both.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.640]   - How'd you end up in Austin?
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.800]   As a small side.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.620]   - Well, I got my undergraduate degree here
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.520]   and then left for 20 years
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.800]   and migrated around.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.840]   So went to UC Berkeley for my PhD,
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.240]   Harvard for my first job, University of Michigan.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.320]   And then a job opened up at University of Texas
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.480]   for an evolutionary psychologist.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.480]   And so they wanted me, fortunately.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.760]   So I was very happy to,
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.800]   so I've always loved Austin.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.680]   - Yeah, the love never died, it was there.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.120]   - Yeah, yeah, it's a great town.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.680]   I was glad that I left.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.960]   So, and experienced, well, both coasts
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.360]   and also the Midwest,
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.800]   but happy to be back in Austin.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.640]   - Let me ask a difficult question.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.460]   Now we did pretty good
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.000]   with some difficult questions already,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.280]   but there are people in this world today
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.600]   who believe that gender is purely a social construct.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.160]   You, I think, are not one of those people.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.960]   To you, what are the difference between men and women?
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.360]   How much of those differences are in nature
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.160]   and how much is nurture?
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.880]   - I guess if you're asking the question morphologically
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.520]   or psychologically, I assume you're asking psychologically.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.320]   - The question is what it is.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.560]   And the answer, sometimes the questions
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.280]   don't contain with them
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.560]   the trajectory you take with the answer, right?
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.560]   So I think I was asking both.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.040]   And the fact that both are a thing is an interesting thing.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.880]   - Yes.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.800]   - So you wrote a book, textbook, I should say,
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.360]   Evolutionary Psychology, right?
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.200]   - Yes.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.840]   - Both of those words are in the book title,
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.280]   psychology, that's the human mind.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.440]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.440]   - How much of gender, how much of sex is the human mind?
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.080]   And how much of it is the biology?
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.480]   - The way that I phrase it,
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.120]   so I don't like sort of dividing the world
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.240]   into two categories, things that are biological
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.760]   versus things that are not biological.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.520]   So the biology is actually defined
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.400]   as the study of life and life processes.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.920]   And so at that sort of abstract level,
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.960]   everything we do is biological,
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.440]   including culture and our capacity for culture,
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.740]   which I think is an evolved capacity that humans have.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.640]   - When you get to the issue of sex and gender,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.440]   I mean, one cut at your question is,
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.340]   are there universal psychological sex differences?
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:44.760]   And the answer to that question is, yes, there are some.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.360]   So for example, well, and this is in one of your areas
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.120]   of specialty, engineering, one of the interesting things
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:59.120]   is that it's called the people's thing dimension.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.520]   So do you want an occupation?
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   You want a job that involves people, social interaction,
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.120]   or are you happy with a job that just involves things,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.720]   mechanical objects or computer code or whatever?
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.920]   And this is one of the largest psychological sex differences
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   that exists, and it's true in every culture.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.520]   So in terms of, I don't know, magnitude of effects,
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:30.360]   it's an effect size of more than a standard deviation,
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.600]   difference between the means
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.200]   on this psychological sex difference.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.720]   And so one of the interesting things is,
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.120]   so if you go to places like,
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   go to the most gender egalitarian cultures in the world.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.220]   So places like Sweden or Norway,
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.520]   which are explicitly gender egalitarian
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.840]   and are truly in many, many ways,
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.480]   but you allow people freedom of choice,
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.120]   some of these sex differences actually get larger,
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.000]   the psychological sex differences,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   and also assortment into different occupational choices.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.920]   Now, but this is not something that I study.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   I study mating, and the sex differences,
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.480]   if you ask in what domains
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.080]   are the sex differences the largest,
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.720]   it turns out they occur
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.640]   within the domain of mating and sexuality.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.320]   So our evolved sexual psychology,
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.920]   our evolved mating psychology
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.040]   is to some degree sexually demorphic.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.160]   Okay, with the very important asterisk
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.760]   that we're talking about overlapping distributions.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.160]   So there are some things that,
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.640]   so if you look at human morphology,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.600]   we talked about breasts earlier.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.840]   Women have evolved functional breasts
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.360]   that's functional for lactation.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.200]   Men don't.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.880]   So there's no amount of culture or social coercion
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.840]   can cause men to have lactating breasts.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.040]   Psychologically, we don't see dimorphism that extreme
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.440]   where something is literally present in one sex
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.920]   and totally absent in the other.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.320]   So there's overlap in the distributions.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   So I mentioned earlier that in the mating domain,
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.880]   men more than women on average
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.760]   prioritize physical appearance,
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.560]   physical attractiveness, relative youth.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.600]   Women on average prioritize resources,
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.040]   resource acquisition,
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.400]   qualities that lead to resource acquisition
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.760]   like status, ambition, industriousness, and so forth.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.520]   But there's overlap in the distributions.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.480]   So some women place the total priority
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.840]   on how physically attractive the guy is,
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.520]   and some men view that as irrelevant.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.000]   And so the point that I'm making
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.480]   is that there are psychological sex differences
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.960]   that make some people uncomfortable.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   But it's one of these things where I'm a scientist,
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.120]   I'm not a political advocate,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.680]   and so I adhere to the empirical data.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.120]   Empirical data are very strong in these domains.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.280]   So with respect to sex differences
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.880]   in the mating domain and sexuality,
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.600]   and things we haven't even talked about
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.040]   like desire for sexual variety
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.440]   and sex differences in the whole desire
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.960]   for short-term mating, huge sex differences there.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.680]   And these have been documented universally in all cultures.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   So, okay, now, are there things that are culture-specific
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.840]   or social-cultural overlays
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.320]   onto these fundamental psychological sex differences?
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.240]   Absolutely.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:57.560]   But there's also an issue of levels of analysis,
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.000]   levels of abstraction,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.880]   and how closely you look at the phenomenon.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.040]   So quick analogy, language.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.280]   So you say, well, in China, they speak Chinese.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.120]   In Korea, they speak Korean.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.920]   In Brazil, they speak Portuguese.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.200]   So look how culturally infinitely variable languages are,
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.080]   which they are at that level.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.080]   But do humans have a universal human innate grammar?
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.520]   And I think the evidence points to the answer yes to that.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.480]   At least that's what Steve Pink or Paul Bloom
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.280]   and some others argue.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.640]   So at one level of abstraction,
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.920]   things are infinitely culturally variable
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.400]   or at least highly culturally variable.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   At another level of abstraction, there's universality.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.320]   So here's one example in the mating domain of this.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.000]   So Margaret Mead, who is a famous anthropologist,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.240]   studied the Samoan Islanders,
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.680]   and she tried to argue basically
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.040]   for the infinite malleability of things like gender
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.880]   and gender roles and so forth.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.200]   And she said, look at this culture.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.600]   In this culture, it's the men who paint their face,
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.920]   whereas in Western cultures,
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.760]   it's the women who wear makeup and so forth.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.320]   Well, it turns out if you look carefully at the culture
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.660]   where men paint their face,
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.840]   they're painting war paint on their face.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.880]   They're not putting on makeup
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.400]   to enhance their cues to youth and cues to health.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.760]   They're putting on war paint
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.680]   to make themselves more ferocious
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.800]   or to demarcate what tribe they're in,
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.480]   what coalition they're in.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.240]   And so at sort of one level of abstraction,
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.480]   you could say, well, there's high cultural variability
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.780]   in application of face paint,
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.840]   but on another level,
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.040]   there's really a fundamental functional difference
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.120]   in the purpose to which the paint is applied.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.240]   - Yeah, and then you can abstract the paint away
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.800]   and fashion in general is magnify the characteristics
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.240]   that are appealing to the opposite sex.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.840]   'Cause war paint is probably,
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.760]   you're magnifying the characteristics
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:13.720]   that are appealing to the other sex.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.880]   So ability to gain resources, maintain resources,
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:22.040]   status in the hierarchy, all those kinds of things.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.800]   - Well, that's part of it,
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.280]   but I think another part has to do with,
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.440]   in that case, male coalitions.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.360]   So we were in a intense,
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.080]   this is another unique characteristic.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.320]   I don't know if you got into this with Richard Wrangham.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.920]   I don't remember you talking about this,
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.000]   but he's written a lot about male coalitionary psychology
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   and humans cooperate to an extraordinary degree
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.680]   in forming coalitions for the purpose
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.160]   of competing with rival coalitions.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.720]   And so you even see this with,
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.080]   well, you see it in the sports arenas
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.560]   with team sports, where this team wears a different uniform
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.280]   than that team, they have different mascot, et cetera.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   And so part of that is male coalitionary psychology.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.080]   - Well, so you write, again, returning to the textbook.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.520]   Now, people should know you wrote a lot of incredible book
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.280]   that is maybe more accessible
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.680]   than the evolutionary psychology textbook, but--
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.280]   - The evolutionary psychology textbook is very accessible.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.800]   - Yes, it is extremely accessible,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.320]   but that's not your thing.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.520]   And on Amazon, you can't, it's a pain.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.480]   It's a textbook.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.400]   It's a little bit more of a pain to purchase,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.600]   which I did, I bought all your books.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.120]   They're amazing.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.920]   We'll talk about a bunch of them.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.720]   But in terms of coalitions,
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.680]   in chapter 12 of your evolutionary psychology textbook,
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.840]   you write about status, prestige, and social dominance.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.440]   So how do hierarchies of status and social dominance emerge
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.040]   in human society?
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.800]   And what's the value of status in sexual selection?
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.000]   We talked about cues of individual health
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.280]   and all that kind of stuff,
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.080]   but what the heck's the purpose of status?
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.360]   Why does it matter if I'm the big boss?
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.640]   - Well, it matters because status
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.920]   influences your access to resources
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:26.520]   and your ability to influence other people
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.800]   within your group.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   And so this is part of the reason why women
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.160]   prioritize a man's social status,
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.320]   how he is viewed in the eyes of others,
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.840]   because high-status men have access to more resources.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.220]   It's interesting that you ask about that
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.160]   because I've just published,
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.000]   this is with Patrick Durkee,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.640]   a former graduate student of mine.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.400]   We published a couple papers on precisely this issue
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.320]   where we looked at what we call human status criteria.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.840]   That is, what are the things that lead to increases
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.500]   or decreases in status?
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.240]   And we did this in 14 different cultures.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.000]   And we found some things that are universal,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.900]   but also some things that are sex-differentiated.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:18.600]   And so universal things like people value
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.440]   trustworthiness, they value intelligence, wisdom, knowledge.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.920]   So it's even, if you go across cultures,
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.920]   even to the small-scale cultures that we alluded to earlier,
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:38.940]   there are these wise people, wise men, wise women
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:43.940]   in the culture who have people go to for advice, for wisdom.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:48.240]   And so having a wide range of knowledge
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.320]   is a universal status criterion.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.600]   And there's some things that are sex-differentiated,
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.880]   and they often fall into the mating domain as well.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.620]   This is where mating and status
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:02.520]   are interestingly related to each other
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.520]   in that successful mating increases your status,
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.680]   but having high status also gives you access
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.520]   to more desirable mates.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.920]   And so the game gets harder and harder always.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.480]   - So wait, so are we talking about what are the characteristics,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:26.240]   what's the role of power and wealth, those kinds of things?
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.120]   So you said wisdom is universal.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:28.960]   - Yeah.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.800]   - What about wealth and power?
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.840]   - Yeah, well, I guess it depends on what you mean by power.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.600]   So I think of power as the ability to influence--
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.560]   - A large number of people.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.560]   - Yeah, so, and this is one of the interesting things
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:47.040]   about the fact that cash economies
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.840]   are evolutionarily very recent,
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.960]   in that people are like, so I guess recently,
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.800]   or it's about to happen,
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.960]   that Elon Musk is gonna buy Twitter.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.420]   - Yeah, it's happened.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.360]   - Has it happened already?
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.200]   - Yeah.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.400]   - Okay, so they say that the wealthiest,
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.760]   or one of the wealthiest men on Earth
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.400]   has now purchased the most influential media platform
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.720]   on Earth.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.720]   So obviously, you or I couldn't compete with Elon Musk
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   for the purchase of Twitter.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:25.840]   And so the fact that cash economies
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.680]   allow the stockpiling of unprecedented amounts of wealth
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.920]   produces these tremendous power differentials
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:37.020]   that didn't exist in over most
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.620]   of human evolutionary history.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.320]   - So their wealth is power,
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.720]   but you can also be,
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.080]   power can be attained through other ways.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.840]   - Yeah, but I would say that the interesting thing
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.840]   about wealth is that it's an infinitely fungible resource.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.960]   So you can use it and translate it
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.280]   into many, many other things,
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.280]   like buying Twitter, or buying a big house,
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.320]   or even getting mates, or an artificial,
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.200]   I don't know if you wanna get into that at all,
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.680]   but I know they have these sex dolls,
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   or virtual reality sex that some people are developing.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.960]   If you have enough resources,
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.480]   you can purchase things like that.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.360]   So you can translate wealth into a variety
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.880]   of other tangible things in ways
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.680]   that you couldn't ancestrally.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.280]   - That's one really powerful thing.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:43.400]   But there is still power that's correlated,
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.200]   but not intricately connected to wealth,
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.720]   which is like being leaders of nations.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.920]   Technically, the President of the United States' salary
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.680]   is not very high.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.840]   - Right.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.120]   - Presidents, and then you go outside of that,
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.440]   and to the half of the world
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.080]   that's living under authoritarian regimes,
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.800]   you have dictators.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.880]   And those are very powerful, usually men.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:14.800]   And presumably, there's some value there
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.840]   in the mating selection aspect.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.400]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.900]   And it's not by chance that most of them are men.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.760]   And this is gonna sound strange,
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.680]   and hopefully not offensive to people,
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.720]   but if you ask the question,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.400]   why is it the case that men are in positions of power
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.360]   so much more so than women?
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.820]   Well, in part, it can be traced to women's mate preferences.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.400]   So it's one of the sex differences
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.960]   that women have, over evolutionary time,
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.960]   preferred men who had power, status, resources, et cetera.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.480]   And what that has done is it's created selection pressure
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.800]   on men to attach a high motivational priority
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.080]   to clawing their way up the status hierarchy.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.080]   And studies of time allocation distribution show this,
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:13.520]   where men, they're more willing to sacrifice their friends,
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.920]   their grandmother, their kin, or whatever,
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.860]   to claw their way up to the top of status hierarchies.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:20.400]   Women, much less so.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.560]   Women spend more effort maintaining relationships
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.040]   with their kin, with their friends,
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.760]   their friend networks, and so forth.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:33.720]   So, and so in a way, you could say,
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.400]   not only are men in positions of power more than women,
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.320]   now you're blaming women for why they are.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.000]   And it's not a matter of blame,
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.960]   but I think that what I just outlined
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.280]   is an essential part of the causal process,
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.240]   the co-evolution of women's mate preferences
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.700]   with men's motivational priorities.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.080]   - How much do you think these mating strategies
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.400]   underlie all of human civilization?
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.880]   Like, what motivates us?
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:08.840]   You know, there's Becker with the denial of death.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.440]   Why do we build castles and bridges and rockets
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.320]   and the internet and all of this?
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.480]   Is it some complex mush, or is it underneath it all,
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.000]   or are we all just trying to get laid?
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.280]   - Well, I wouldn't reduce it to something
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.040]   quite as trying to get laid.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.740]   But I think mating is certainly a part of it.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:34.320]   - I wonder how big of a part,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.320]   'cause so with Ernest Becker,
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.120]   the idea is that we're all trying to achieve
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.400]   an illusion of immortality.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.600]   So we're trying to create something that outlasts us,
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.920]   and therefore we create bigger and bigger things
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.120]   in societies and bridges and architecture.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.080]   - Yeah, well, I think what's missing
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.600]   from Becker's analysis is, you know,
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.360]   I mean, it's a fascinating book to read,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.000]   Denial of Death, but what's missing is
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.280]   that I think that the reason that,
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.080]   and again, I think it's more men than women.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.840]   I think there's a sex difference on this,
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   that men want to build a lasting legacy
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:19.340]   because that will in turn affect their lineage.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.680]   And although I do, now, Woody Allen is out of favor,
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.320]   but I remember this quote from him.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.400]   He said, he said, he didn't want to achieve immortality
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.440]   through his work, he wanted to achieve immortality
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.700]   by not dying.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:42.240]   - Oh boy, the funny ones are also deeply flawed often.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.380]   Staying on the topic of sex differences
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.280]   in a very different way, perhaps.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.740]   So dominance and submissiveness,
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.240]   something you've also written about.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.400]   What's the role of that inside relationships
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.160]   about this human dynamic of dominance and submissiveness?
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:06.480]   Is that a feature or a bug?
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:10.060]   So the stable state that these dynamical systems arrive at,
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:16.080]   is it good to have an equality within a relationship
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.880]   or is it good to have differences in a relationship?
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.600]   - Are you talking about romantic relationships
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.560]   or just in human relationships?
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.800]   - Romantic, probably, because unless it could be generalized
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.360]   to human relationships,
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.720]   perhaps it could be generalized to human relationships.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.640]   I wasn't thinking that, but perhaps it could be.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.120]   But let's start with romantic, I guess one-on-one.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:41.120]   - I'm personally in favor of equality on that dimension
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.200]   within romantic relationships
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.200]   and I don't talk about my personal life,
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.040]   but I've been in relationships
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   and the best ones tend to be those where there's equality
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.860]   and one person does not dominate the other.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:03.720]   But I guess the reason I ask you
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.220]   is in what type of relationships,
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:08.760]   because there's some things like coalitions
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:12.440]   where hierarchy is very important
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.040]   to the function of the coalition.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.200]   So it's like if you're like a war coalition or something
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.560]   in small group warfare, you can't just have equality.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.480]   You have to have leaders
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   that are determining the battle plan, so to speak.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:36.560]   And so if you're attacking a neighboring group or something
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.320]   and everyone gets an equal say,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.680]   it's not gonna work that way.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.600]   And so we tend to appoint as leaders those who are,
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.560]   so it's not always work out well,
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.520]   but those who are presumably wise or good, effective leaders
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.840]   and even talk about, and I'm sure you're familiar with this
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.280]   and I'm not an expert on this,
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.200]   but wartime leaders versus peacetime leaders.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.720]   And so, again, it depends on what the goal is
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.240]   of the group that you are a part of.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.360]   And so I think there is functionality and utility
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.960]   to a lot of our evolved psychology of status
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.040]   and dominance and submissiveness.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.640]   So for example, and you have to look
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.240]   at the individual psychology,
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.280]   and this is actually something I'm currently studying,
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.060]   again, with Patrick Durkee,
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:34.640]   where one advantage of the status hierarchies
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.600]   is that you're not always battling.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:41.800]   So you determine, and that's why,
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.520]   here's another sexually dimorphic aspect of our psychology,
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.560]   formidability assessment.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:52.760]   So there's evidence that males engage in this,
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:56.400]   can I take this guy or can he take me?
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.600]   And it's like a-- - Entirety of my life, yes.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.880]   - It's like a spontaneous assessment of formidability.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.320]   And it also, that information is critical
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:11.120]   because that means who you should not challenge
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.000]   or who you can challenge with impunity.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:21.520]   And there's functionality to submitting as well,
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:26.320]   because you defer to someone so that you don't get vanquished
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.920]   and you live to see another day.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.000]   So I think we actually have a very rich psychology
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.640]   of status hierarchies and dominance and submissiveness.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:40.640]   - So especially sort of violent conflict, yes.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.960]   But back to relationships.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.880]   So maybe phrased another way,
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.280]   what is masculinity, what is femininity?
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.260]   Is there value inside a relationship for differences?
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.320]   You talked about mating,
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.800]   mating strategies with the dating stage
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:05.480]   where you're selecting the mate,
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.760]   but also within, mating broadly defined
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.040]   as the entirety of the process.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:17.040]   Should those differences be magnified and celebrated
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.720]   or sort of suppressed?
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.840]   - I've seen enough different relationships work
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.840]   and I've seen enough relationships implode
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.840]   to say there's not one size fits all on these things.
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.480]   So even with respect to masculinity and femininity,
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.120]   some reduce it psychologically to two other terms,
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.880]   which are agency and communion.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   So where agency is, are you instrumental, goal-oriented,
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.260]   get tasks done, et cetera.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:55.240]   Communion is more the love and forming connections
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.880]   with other people and so forth.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.000]   And I published a study a while back
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.880]   on what's called unmitigated agency
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.760]   and unmitigated communion.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.640]   So there are like good and bad aspects
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.680]   of agency and communion.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.440]   - So there's toxic, as they say, masculinity,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.900]   toxic femininity, you can just rephrase that saying
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.400]   there could be toxic agency and toxic communion.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.240]   And so some elements of masculinity,
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:32.200]   the unmitigated masculinity is, I think, terrible.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.040]   I was actually walking around downtown Austin earlier today
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.560]   and I'll just give you this example.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:42.560]   And this guy was, I guess, stuck
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.200]   and wanted the car ahead of him to move.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.080]   And all of a sudden he screamed out of his,
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.960]   move your fucking car!
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:55.920]   And then jumped out of his car and to a person,
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:00.880]   to me, that's toxic masculinity, if you will.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.060]   We don't need that.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:05.280]   - Yeah, so, and by the way,
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:08.080]   as somebody who worked with cars quite a long time
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.740]   in terms of human interaction with semi-autonomous vehicles,
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:15.440]   it's so fascinating how the car and traffic
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   brings out the worst in human nature, in a sense,
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.560]   or maybe to rephrase that,
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:29.160]   it maybe challenges you to explore something that,
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:31.120]   in terms of temper, in terms of anger,
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.360]   in terms of anxiety that you have been bottling it up.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.800]   There's something where the car is like a vessel
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.520]   for psychological experiment of how much stress
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.440]   you can take.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.960]   And some people, that stress is like heating,
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:48.360]   it's making the water boil.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.560]   And it's fascinating to see what that results in.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.040]   I think if you are the kind of person
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.720]   that explodes emotionally in traffic,
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.680]   that means there's deeper issues to sort of confront.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.520]   And it seems like the traffic and the car
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.520]   is a place where you get to confront the shadow,
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.360]   Carl Jung's shadow.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.200]   There's something deep within that that we don't often fish.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.680]   We're alone with ourselves
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.660]   and we get to see who we truly are.
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:22.440]   - Yeah, well, yeah, it can bring out road rage.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.800]   And also there's this, I don't know,
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.640]   when you're in the vehicle,
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.920]   you have this shell around you.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.320]   And so there's this feeling that you are protected from.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.720]   - Yes, so you could be yourself,
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.000]   you could be your true self in this moment.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.640]   And sometimes that true self in this moment
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.480]   is an angry, screaming person,
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:46.480]   which means you have to introspect that shadow,
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.960]   shine a light.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:52.020]   Let me ask you about something that's ongoing currently.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.140]   It'd be fascinating to get your opinion on.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:58.020]   So something I've been watching,
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.940]   some of the world has been watching,
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:03.460]   is the defamation trial brought by Johnny Depp
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:05.180]   against Amber Heard.
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.060]   Have you gotten a chance to watch any of it?
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:10.420]   - I haven't watched it, but I've read some reports of it.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:14.700]   - What's your analysis on this particular dynamic?
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.340]   We talked about toxicity
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.620]   in the space of agency and communion.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:25.540]   What do you make of this relationship
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.060]   that's presented to the world in its raw form?
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:31.340]   - You know, I don't have strong opinions on it.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.300]   I think in this stage in the trial,
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:35.940]   we've heard from him primarily.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:37.580]   - We have not, and we should say,
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:38.420]   for people listening,
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.500]   in case this is published a little bit later,
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.700]   we have not heard from Amber Heard.
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.780]   - Right, not heard from Heard.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:46.820]   We've heard from Heard.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:47.660]   We're doing that.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.540]   That's going to be happening this week.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:50.620]   - I don't know.
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:54.300]   I think that I've seen,
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.620]   and this is another topic that I have studied,
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.660]   is intima partner violence
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:01.860]   and some of the nastier stuff
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:03.640]   that goes on within relationships.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.500]   And I think that when this nasty stuff happens,
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.460]   sometimes it's asymmetrical,
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.980]   but sometimes it's symmetrical
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:16.140]   in the sense that they get into these downward spirals
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.340]   where one is insulting the other,
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:20.100]   or even with physical violence,
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.820]   one starts pushing the other,
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.180]   shoving the other, hitting the other,
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.820]   and then the other hits back.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.900]   And so you get into these cycles.
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.900]   And so coming at one point in time,
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.000]   in this case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.120]   years later and trying to disentangle
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.780]   what actually went on in their relationship,
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:48.260]   I don't feel qualified even to do that.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.300]   - Well, it's fascinating to see.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.740]   So first, I mean, I have a lot of opinions,
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.740]   particularly because I'm just a fan of Johnny Depp
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:01.920]   as a person and a fan of Johnny Depp, the actor,
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.660]   and the kind of characters he created.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:06.860]   The person, because maybe this is fiction,
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:10.340]   maybe this is reality, but they tend to rhyme.
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.000]   And mirror each other,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.660]   but his fascination with Hunter S. Thompson,
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.600]   and then some aspect of him taking on
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.560]   the Hunter S. Thompson personality,
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.940]   where there's this layers upon layers of wit and humor,
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:27.840]   and also anxiety and darkness with the drug use
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.680]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.360]   So it's very human, very real person.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.440]   And so you get to,
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.080]   one of the beautiful things about this trial
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.840]   is you get to basically have a long-form podcast.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.900]   And you get to reveal the complexity of this human,
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.900]   the humor under pressure, under stress,
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:48.980]   but also just the rawness of love,
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:52.180]   the things that love makes you do, or whatever that is.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:56.540]   Whatever the things that keeps us in relationships
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:00.200]   that are toxic in that turmoil,
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.200]   the hope, the self-delusion,
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:11.500]   the push and pull of longing and fights,
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:16.180]   the ups and downs, whatever the--
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.420]   - Yeah, the rollercoaster. - The rollercoaster.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.420]   - The make-up, sex. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.940]   - You know, yeah.
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:24.900]   - And the questions arise whether that's a feature or a bug.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.060]   Like, why are we drawn to that?
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.020]   You mentioned inmate selection,
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.580]   for long-term mate selection,
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.800]   I think you said women, but I think maybe both
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:37.700]   don't want a kind of,
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:40.420]   you had scientific and eloquent words to use,
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:42.540]   but basically crazy people.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:44.740]   You want somebody who's stable.
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:46.340]   - Emotionally unstable, yeah.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:53.260]   - But here it seems like maybe we're drawn to that still,
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.660]   like flies to the light.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.980]   - Right, well, it can be addictive,
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.540]   but it's not good for long-term relationships.
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:02.060]   I mean, that characteristic,
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:05.660]   and there is a stable personality characteristic.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:09.020]   It goes under different names, anxiety, neuroticism,
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.820]   emotional lability, et cetera,
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.980]   but that's the single personality characteristic
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:18.300]   that is most predictive of breakups and divorces.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.760]   And in studies that I've done,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.580]   predictive of conflict in couples,
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:27.060]   people who are emotionally unstable,
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.980]   they just get into a lot of conflict with their partner.
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:32.120]   They create havoc.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.600]   Now, that can be exciting,
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.060]   but bad for long-term happiness.
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:46.060]   - They seek conflict in order to attain intimacy.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.020]   So conflict creates attention.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:50.860]   - Yeah.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:58.820]   - If you take intimacy broadly, it's intimate.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:02.860]   'Cause you're like raw, fragile, you're right there.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:06.780]   - Yeah, well, and I mean, there's one hypothesis
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:10.740]   that was put forward by an Israeli biologist
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:15.740]   named Amos Zahavi called the testing of a bond.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.100]   And so he asked the question,
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:20.700]   like why do people inflict costs on their partner?
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:25.140]   Even like kissing, you're introducing,
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:26.540]   it's a disease vector.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:31.460]   Why do people do these weird things, inflicting costs,
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:35.180]   or emotional liability as a way of inflicting costs?
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.620]   And what he argues is it's the testing of a bond.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:43.260]   If the person's willing to tolerate this level of stress,
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:45.580]   this level of cost imposition,
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.260]   then that means they must be very committed to me.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:50.660]   And so, and I think that's something people do
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:52.880]   in romantic relationships,
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.460]   is they do test the strength of the bond.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:59.100]   They test the commitment of the person.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:02.700]   And I think that's a feature, not a bug,
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:04.540]   in the sense that,
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:09.860]   especially in the early stages of love, romantic love,
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:14.500]   we tend to overly romanticize and idealize our partner.
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.660]   So when there's an absence of evidence,
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:19.780]   we impute positive values.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:23.700]   And this is one of my recommendations
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:26.500]   to friends that I know is,
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.860]   if you're really considering a good long-term commitment
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.420]   to this person, go on vacation with them.
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:35.820]   Ideally to a foreign country
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.580]   where both of you are unfamiliar.
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:38.420]   - Oh, I love it.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.460]   Road trip or something like that.
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:43.020]   - Yeah, so where you experience unexpected things,
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:47.060]   stresses, you get a flat tire or whatever,
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:51.540]   you encounter, and you see how the person deals with stress,
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:55.180]   and you see how you deal with each other under stress.
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.600]   And I think that that's,
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.140]   unless you have put stress tests on relationships,
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.140]   you really don't know where things stand.
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.820]   - Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.700]   I'm a huge fan of that, like road trip.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.300]   And not just late in a relationship, like day one.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:12.340]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:15.040]   - Road trip, not day one, day negative one,
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.720]   before it even happens, just see, stress test.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:20.020]   'Cause it makes everybody better.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.220]   It creates intimacy, or it creates,
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.740]   it creates or it destroys.
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:28.460]   But, you know, on the Johnny,
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:32.260]   so they also, they both suffered childhood abuse.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:35.260]   One of the things that I took away from the trial,
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.140]   for me, it was just educational.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:43.140]   I don't get to see inside, as most of us maybe don't,
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:46.420]   like toxic relationships or fights and so on.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.340]   A lot of things that people maybe do inside of relationships
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:52.820]   and we don't get to see it presented in such a raw way.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:56.340]   So, one of the things I learned is that,
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:00.900]   you know, in terms of partner violence,
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.540]   a woman too, can be violent.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:05.100]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:08.700]   - That to me, so emotionally and physically violent,
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:13.700]   that, I almost don't want to, you know,
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:18.380]   Amber Heard, I mean, there's no limit
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:21.280]   to my dislike for that person in particular.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:27.120]   Because clearly, to me at least, I stand with Johnny Depp.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.660]   To me, that guy is full of love.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.220]   And, but full of demons because he's drawn
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.680]   to whatever the chaos that's created there.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.060]   But also, it's just an education for me that,
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:42.780]   I tend to associate sort of men with violence
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:46.980]   and toxicity and destruction inside relationships.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.260]   But it was interesting to see that women too
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.020]   can be like directly violent.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:53.860]   - Yeah.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:58.180]   - And men too, which was also surprising to me,
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:02.260]   have the capacity to stay in such a relationship
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:03.820]   and to not walk away.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.260]   Which is what I thought is my,
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.220]   in terms of toxic violent relationships,
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:11.060]   I thought there's a male figure who will do emotional
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:13.740]   and physical, mostly physical violence
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:18.140]   and then kind of manipulate the mind of the female
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:19.500]   to stay in the relationship.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.100]   But that dynamic goes, can go both ways.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.020]   - Yeah, it does go both ways.
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:28.420]   And I think even the emotional abuse
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:31.660]   is sometimes even worse than the physical abuse.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:34.500]   I mean, you see that in studies of,
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.220]   even like childhood abuse,
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:40.980]   where it's the emotional abuse that is the most damaging.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.700]   What about the role of jealousy?
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:47.080]   Something you also written about in a relationship.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.380]   Is that a feature or a bug?
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.060]   You started to speak about it,
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:57.420]   but is it good to be jealous of your partner
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:59.380]   inside of a relationship?
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:01.020]   How does it go wrong?
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:03.500]   The pros and cons.
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.020]   - So I've written a whole book on this
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.700]   called "The Dangerous Passion."
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.420]   Why Jealousy is as Necessary as Sex and Love.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:17.420]   And I think that one cut at your question
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:21.020]   is that a moderate, so first of all,
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:24.180]   I think it's a feature, not a bug in most cases.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:29.180]   So in the sense that you have to have an adaptation
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:34.820]   that is sensitive to threats to a valued relationship.
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.660]   Because, and I think I alluded to this earlier,
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:41.460]   that just because you're in a relationship
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:43.940]   and you're in a relationship with a desirable partner,
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:48.340]   doesn't mean that you've finished solving the problems
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:50.220]   of mating that you need to solve.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.740]   Because there are threats from the outside.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.940]   So mate poachers, people who try to lure your partner away
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.700]   for either a sexual encounter
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:02.380]   or a more committed romantic relationship.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.340]   And then there's also dissatisfaction
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:05.900]   within the relationship.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.580]   So your partner might become tempted
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:12.100]   to be sexually unfaithful or romantically unfaithful
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.940]   or emotionally unfaithful.
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:18.140]   And so we need humans with the evolution
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:19.900]   of long-term pair bonding,
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:24.220]   we need adaptations to guard the relationship
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:28.020]   and be sensitive to threats to the relationship.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.740]   And I think jealousy is one of those.
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.900]   I think it's a key one.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:36.900]   And now that I think that there are a variety
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.940]   of benefits to it, but also a variety of costs
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.380]   or downsides to jealousy.
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:46.980]   Because we know that jealousy, male sexual jealousy
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:49.900]   is the leading cause of spousal abuse
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:52.780]   and spousal violence, physical violence,
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:54.740]   probably emotional violence as well,
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:57.300]   or psychological violence.
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.700]   And so that's why I call it the dangerous passion.
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:02.420]   It's a necessary emotion,
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:05.420]   but it is also a dangerous emotion.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:07.620]   Leads to homicide.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:10.260]   You know, leads to...
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:14.180]   And I've studied also homicidal ideation,
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.420]   which intersects with this topic
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:21.300]   in that men, sometimes women to a lesser degree,
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.940]   develop homicidal ideation about people
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.500]   who are trying to poach their mates
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:28.300]   or who do poach their mates,
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.300]   successfully poach their mates.
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.740]   So what jealousy does is it alerts you
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:35.940]   to a threat to the relationship,
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.740]   and it motivates checking out the source of the threat.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:41.420]   How threatening is this?
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:44.500]   So people tend to increase vigilance
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.580]   of their partner in the modern world
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.380]   and includes hacking into their cell phone or computer,
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:55.380]   monitoring them, sometimes stalking them.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:00.740]   But also can include positive things.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.580]   So it might be that...
[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:04.020]   So one trigger of jealousy
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.660]   is a direct threat to the relationship.
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:10.340]   But there's another more subtle trigger of jealousy,
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:13.100]   which is a mate value discrepancy.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:16.340]   So usually when people mate,
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:19.540]   they assort or pair up on overall mate value.
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.940]   So in the American 10-point scale,
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.740]   the eights tend to pair up with the eights,
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.540]   the sixes with the sixes,
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.380]   the tens with the tens, and the ones with the ones.
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.660]   - American, is there other scales?
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:33.540]   I wonder if the numerical systems,
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.660]   well, there's a binary.
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:37.260]   I just call it binary, zero, one.
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.140]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:40.860]   The eights pairs with the eights, sevens.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.460]   - Yeah, yeah, so in general,
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:44.820]   but there are errors in mate selection.
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.380]   You kind of alluded to that issue earlier
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:50.380]   that sometimes people make errors in mate selection,
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:51.220]   which they do.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:52.980]   So sometimes you think this person
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:56.580]   is well-matched on mate value, but they're not.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:58.140]   But then things change.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:01.460]   So let's say they're the same,
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:02.700]   you have two sixes,
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.620]   and then all of a sudden the woman's career takes off.
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:09.340]   All of a sudden she's getting promotion,
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:11.860]   she's acquiring wealth,
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:16.860]   she's attracting men who are of a different mate value
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:18.580]   than she previously did.
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:20.740]   Well, that triggers jealousy in the guy.
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:23.500]   Even if she swears she's gonna be totally loyal
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:27.020]   and she has no signs of leaving or no signs of infidelity,
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:30.140]   a mate value discrepancy is gonna trigger jealousy.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.620]   Now, what can it do?
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.900]   Well, it can do, in the broadest sense,
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.980]   people can do two classes of things.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.780]   They can do cost-inflicting things
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:41.020]   or benefit-providing things.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:44.140]   So the man in that situation might say,
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:47.100]   "Okay, I need to devote more attention to my partner.
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:48.820]   "I need to up my game
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.700]   "when it comes to resource acquisition.
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:55.700]   "I need to lavish more attention and gifts on her."
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:59.580]   And so there's a whole suite of benefit-provisioning things
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:02.760]   that can help to reduce that mate value discrepancy.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.020]   And then there's also cost-inflicting things.
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:11.660]   And humans, unfortunately, do both sets of things.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:16.540]   - Yeah, there's also this, maybe that's love.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:21.540]   I notice the people I especially love
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:25.140]   or have a connection to romantically or otherwise,
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.360]   there's a feeling like I don't deserve you.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.700]   So with friends, with so on,
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:34.460]   like, I mean, I tend to think that about almost everything,
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:35.740]   which is why it's a strong signal
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.580]   when I don't feel it that way,
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:40.780]   which is like, I can't, how lucky am I to have this?
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:46.460]   And that's a weird illusion of inflation of value
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.300]   or something.
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.540]   I think that the positive effect of that
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.180]   is it motivates me to be better,
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:57.460]   I guess on this one to 10 scale, to be higher.
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:59.740]   And you sort of kind of have to,
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:04.580]   it's a nice feature that your mind sees others
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:07.740]   that you have affection towards as higher value,
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:10.540]   and it forces you to have that.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:12.660]   I'm a person that experiences jealousy,
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.100]   and that forces me to be better.
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:16.300]   I get my shit together.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:18.060]   - Yeah, well, and I think that
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:21.220]   sometimes the best relationships
[01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:25.620]   are when both people feel lucky to be with the other person.
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:27.900]   - Yes, exactly, it's balanced that way.
[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:30.300]   And then that's when you, in terms of jobs,
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:33.100]   in terms of going to the gym, all those kinds of things.
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:36.420]   And yeah, so a little bit of jealousy.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:37.700]   I have discussion with those people.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:40.620]   I always wonder, there's people in relationships
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:44.460]   where like, no, no, they never experienced jealousy.
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.380]   I wonder what that's like,
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.540]   'cause they're very successful relationships,
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:50.660]   and I always wonder, I'm currently single,
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:54.100]   so I always doubt that I know what the hell I'm doing at all.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.620]   But I'm definitely somebody that experiences jealousy
[01:51:56.620 --> 01:52:00.740]   and kind of enjoys jealousy, like a little bit.
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:03.620]   I like missing, to me that's like,
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:05.340]   you're missing the other person.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:06.580]   - Yeah, well-- - Or longing
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.420]   for the other person.
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:10.340]   - And here's another interesting wrinkle
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:13.100]   that I also talk about in the book is,
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:16.540]   sometimes people intentionally evoke jealousy
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.600]   in their partner.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:23.180]   And I think that's also a kind of testing of a bond
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:24.460]   kind of issue.
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:29.100]   So, and especially women, but I think both sexes
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:32.420]   interpret a total absence of jealousy
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.220]   as a sign that their partner's not sufficiently committed
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:37.860]   to them or sufficiently in love with them.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.820]   So if you like to say, I don't know,
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:42.340]   if you go to a party with your partner
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:45.100]   and then you leave the room for some reason,
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:47.540]   you come back and your partner is passionately kissing
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:50.200]   someone else and doesn't bother you at all,
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:52.660]   that might be a cue to the partner
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:55.700]   that maybe you're not very in love with that person
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.980]   or not very committed to them.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.900]   And so-- - So it's a good way to,
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:01.980]   it's a good way to test.
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:04.340]   That said, I mean, I love the term mate poaching,
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:05.260]   by the way.
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:08.140]   I believe here in Texas, mate poaching is officially illegal
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:11.100]   so I'm allowed to, one of my favorite songs by Hendrix
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:12.160]   is "Hey Joe."
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.380]   Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:19.740]   And yeah, I actually always wanted to play that song
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:24.180]   but I get, I start to think about guns and so on.
[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:27.340]   I think it's supposed to capture a feeling.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:28.620]   It's not actual violence.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:30.620]   It's saying, I'm gonna shoot my old lady.
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:33.380]   I caught her messing around with another man.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:38.300]   That's a blues type of feeling, like of anger,
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.500]   I guess for mate poaching, for mate switching
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.940]   performed by the partner and then the frustration
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.740]   and the anger that's resulting.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:51.780]   I always wondered why the violence
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:54.440]   is directed towards the partner
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:58.140]   versus the person who did the other male.
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:00.520]   - It tends to be evenly split.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:05.520]   So sometimes, and that's, I mean, men especially,
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.900]   when someone poaches on their mate,
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.580]   they have homicidal fantasies.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:13.300]   - Towards which, equally split?
[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:16.260]   - Towards the mate poacher, yeah, but equally split.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:21.260]   So it's, I think the non-lethal violence
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:26.140]   tends to be more directed toward the mate
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:30.700]   because it's, and this is a horrible thing
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:32.500]   of male sexual psychology,
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:35.280]   but I think part of the violence is functional
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:38.780]   in the sense that it's designed to keep a mate
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:41.460]   and prevent her from engaging in anything
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:45.220]   with other potential mate poachers.
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:49.160]   But people do.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:54.060]   So even, it goes back to the French law
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:57.380]   where they had the so-called crime of passion.
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:01.540]   So if a husband walked in and found his wife
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:05.360]   having sex with some other guy in bed and shot him,
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.880]   that was viewed as a crime of passion.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:11.580]   It's still not legal, but you kind of get a discount for it.
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:14.620]   Whereas if he goes home, thinks about it for a while,
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:15.880]   then gets the gun and comes back,
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.800]   then that's premeditated murder.
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.080]   - Yeah, see, to me, I guess everybody's different.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.560]   To me, I have zero anger towards the partner
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:27.880]   in that situation, to me, 'cause that's definitive proof
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:29.840]   of the soliloquy.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.760]   So what's the function of the anger there?
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:38.580]   To me, all of my anger is towards the guy, the poacher.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:44.140]   Because some of it has to do probably
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:45.700]   with the status establishing.
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:48.220]   What was the term you used?
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:51.140]   Formidability?
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.700]   - Yeah, formidability assessment.
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.540]   - Assessment.
[01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:54.380]   And I'm like, wait, wait, wait,
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:57.460]   did you just say you're more formidable than me
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:58.380]   in this situation?
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:00.640]   I wanna reestablish, at least in my own mind,
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:01.800]   the formidability.
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.680]   And that seems to be, I guess we're all different,
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.920]   but maybe 'cause I roll around with guys a lot,
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:10.120]   like grapple and wrestling, all that kind of stuff.
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.040]   To me, to establish status is competing with other males,
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.200]   not with the female.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.140]   'Cause that's a break of loyalty.
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:19.440]   What's the point of anger at this point?
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.680]   That's just betrayal.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:25.040]   - Well, except that a lot of the mate poaching
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.620]   is discovered, or cues to mate poaching
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:32.300]   are discovered before the consummation of the act.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.140]   So it might be just--
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:35.660]   - Oh, like the emotional cheating leading up to it.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:40.620]   - Or mild flirtation, things like that.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:45.620]   And so the violence is designed to head off the threat
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:50.240]   before it becomes real.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.220]   - Boy, aren't human relations,
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.480]   especially romantic ones, complicated?
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.320]   - Very.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.300]   But that's what makes them so fascinating to study.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.740]   - Yes, exactly, from a science perspective,
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.100]   and to study from within,
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:06.980]   like Richard Ranham with the chimps,
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:11.140]   be in it.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:13.460]   Study from the N of one perspective.
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.360]   What do you make of polyamory?
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.900]   So what the heck is, what do you make of marriage?
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:20.380]   What are your thoughts about marriage?
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:22.700]   What are your thoughts about lifelong monogamy?
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.600]   What's your thoughts about polyamory,
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.360]   given that we've been talking about ideas
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.800]   of mate switching and poaching and all that kind of stuff?
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.400]   - Yeah, I think that we evolved to be,
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:36.400]   I prefer the term pair-bonded species.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:41.080]   So pair-bonding is one of the strategies.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:44.300]   Pair-bonded long-term mating is one of the strategies.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:47.520]   But that doesn't necessarily mean for decades and decades
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:50.760]   and our lifelong, 'cause we often pair-bond serially.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:53.820]   So we get into a relationship that might last a year
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:55.900]   or five years and then break up
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:57.780]   and then form another relationship.
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:59.640]   So we engage in serial mating.
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.900]   We engage in infidelity.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:07.900]   We engage in some short-term mating.
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:10.620]   And so we have what I describe
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:12.860]   as a menu of mating strategies.
[01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:17.200]   And which particular mating strategy an individual adopts
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.600]   depends on a wide variety of factors.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:22.920]   I think some are just kind of personal proclivities.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.580]   Some depend on your mate value.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:27.300]   So if you are an eight, a nine, or a 10,
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.340]   you have more options
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:32.480]   for what mating strategy you wanna pursue.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:33.860]   If you're a one or a two,
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:37.360]   you're not gonna be able to be polyamorous
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.660]   in all likelihood.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:42.240]   There's a lot of attention to polyamory now.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:47.480]   And it's unclear whether there's an increase in it
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:50.200]   or whether people are just talking about it more.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:55.500]   It is the case, and I know several people
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.340]   who are in polyamorous relationships
[01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:01.220]   and I've talked with them in detail about them.
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:04.440]   And jealousy is often a factor in that.
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:08.900]   And they describe it as kind of like an emotion
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:13.020]   that has to be somehow tamed or dealt with in some way.
[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:14.900]   And so in polyamory,
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:17.920]   there are many different types of polyamory.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.040]   So in like one type, for example,
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:22.760]   is you have a primary love partner
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:26.860]   and then some others on the side that are permitted,
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:29.720]   usually within in consensual terms,
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:33.680]   within an explicit contract
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:35.540]   that the primary partners work out.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:37.480]   So it's okay if you,
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:40.080]   I know as one couple,
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:44.080]   it's okay if you do it outside the city limits
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:47.000]   of Los Angeles, but not within.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.160]   Some say it's okay for Thursday,
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:52.880]   but I want the weekend, Friday and Saturday nights to me.
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:57.920]   It's okay if there's sexual involvement,
[01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:59.940]   but no emotional involvement.
[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:03.680]   So there are different strategies that people work out.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:07.880]   And some of them are designed to try to keep jealousy at bay.
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.640]   So I think it's an evolved emotion
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.340]   that is a natural emotion that people experience.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.540]   Now, interestingly, there's a,
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.000]   while we're on this topic,
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.060]   there's a sex difference therein,
[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:23.820]   namely if you contrast sexual jealousy
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:25.740]   with emotional jealousy
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:29.580]   or sexual infidelity with emotional infidelity.
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:32.760]   And so we, in one set of studies,
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.020]   I put my participants,
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:37.400]   or we used to call them subjects,
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.780]   into this, what I call the Sophie's choice
[02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:41.780]   of the jealousy dilemmas.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:43.580]   Where I said, imagine your partner
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:45.780]   became interested in someone else,
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.780]   and you discover that they have had
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:51.580]   passionate sexual intercourse with this person,
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:55.460]   and they've gotten emotionally involved with them,
[02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:57.460]   they've fallen in love with them.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:01.500]   Which aspect of the infidelity upsets you more?
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:05.020]   And when you, and that's why I call it the Sophie's choice,
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.980]   both terrible choices, right?
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:08.040]   - Yeah.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:10.100]   - But men much more likely to say
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:13.260]   the sexual infidelity is what upsets me.
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.540]   More women, it's like, why are you even asking me?
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:16.420]   It's a no-brainer.
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:19.220]   85% of the women say the emotional infidelity
[02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:21.100]   is what bothers them more.
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.420]   Former student of mine, Barry Cooley,
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:26.340]   did a really interesting study of analysis
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:28.740]   of this reality show called Cheaters.
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:29.860]   I've actually never seen it,
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:34.860]   but where if you suspect your partner of cheating,
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:39.700]   then a detective from the TV team will follow the person,
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:42.180]   and then they'll call up and say,
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.180]   we've just found your husband here in the No-Tell Motel,
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:48.060]   do you wanna come down and talk to him?
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:50.140]   And so what he analyzed, though,
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:53.660]   was the verbal interrogations that people had
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:55.540]   when they confronted their partner,
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:00.540]   and women wanted to know, are you in love with her?
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:04.580]   Men wanted to know, did you fuck him?
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:06.260]   Or did you have sex with him?
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:09.540]   And so it's this sex difference in sensitivity
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:12.500]   to these different cues of infidelity.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.020]   And of course, there's an evolutionary logic
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:18.940]   to this sex difference, and it's been replicated,
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.500]   not the Cheaters study,
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:24.940]   but the hypothetical Sophie's Choice study.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.780]   It's been replicated now in Sweden and China,
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:30.900]   and it's a universal sex difference.
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:32.620]   - So given that sex difference,
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:35.300]   and you mentioned another one that just returned to,
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:38.540]   which is in the engineering disciplines.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.900]   - Yeah, person thing, orientation.
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:43.220]   - So until I started to see,
[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.580]   writing about it in the psychology literature,
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:48.860]   I observed this anecdotally a lot.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:51.340]   And the reason I observed it is I was confused.
[02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:54.620]   So I care a lot about robots, I'm a robotics person.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:58.320]   And so a lot of males in the robotics community
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.100]   really didn't care about what's called
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:02.260]   the human-robot interaction problem,
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:05.140]   which is like robots when they interact with humans.
[02:03:05.140 --> 02:03:08.900]   And then a lot of females, all brilliant
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.540]   in the robotics community,
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:12.340]   cared about the human-robot interaction.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:14.100]   They cared about the human,
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:16.340]   what the robot communicates with the human,
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:18.700]   human in the picture, human in the loop.
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:21.780]   And I was really confused, 'cause the difference to me
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:24.820]   in my anecdotal interactions,
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:27.300]   but the N is quite large there.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:31.380]   I'm in the robotics community, I know a lot of people.
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:34.620]   And I was confused because for me,
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:37.180]   I really care about human-robot interaction.
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:40.700]   I care about both a lot.
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:44.980]   And the same thing here in terms of emotional cheating
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.860]   versus physical cheating.
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:50.500]   I care a lot about both, and I have this oscillating brain.
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:53.000]   So I wonder what that says about my brain.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.980]   So I'll often wonder this,
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:57.300]   'cause there's specific sex differences
[02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:00.100]   that are represented in the data in the literature,
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:03.380]   and they seem to oscillate depending on mood.
[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:06.140]   And I wonder what that says about me.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:09.900]   Why do I care so much about that robot on the floor?
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:14.420]   I care not, half I care about how it works,
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:18.060]   and the other half, how it makes other people feel.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:18.900]   What is that?
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.380]   - Yeah, so I guess what I would say,
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.880]   this gets back to our earlier discussion
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.780]   of agency and communion,
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:29.100]   where I actually think that it's a sign
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:34.100]   of being well-balanced, to have both capacities within you.
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:39.100]   And so you get people who are unimodal,
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:42.300]   or they just have one mode of operating.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.980]   Let's say it's the thing mode,
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:46.940]   which engineers tend to be good at.
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:50.380]   You have to be good at it to be a good engineer,
[02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:52.340]   'cause things have to actually work.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:56.020]   It's not in some dream or hypothetical state.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:58.480]   Things have to actually work.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.540]   But with the agency and communion,
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:02.540]   I think it's good to have a balance.
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:04.740]   And that's why I think some of the best
[02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:08.620]   romantic relationships are those where people are,
[02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:12.180]   they're high on what they used to call androgyny,
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:15.860]   where they have both the positive features
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:17.500]   of agency and communion,
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:21.740]   the positive features of masculinity and femininity
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.020]   within the same mix,
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:28.020]   but also with the footnote of not the unmitigated agency
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:32.000]   or unmitigated communion, both of which can be negative.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.360]   And so I view these as capacities,
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:38.400]   and some people are out of balance,
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.560]   some people have a good balance between the two.
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.440]   It sounds like you have a good balance between the two.
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:43.820]   - Well, but also the allocation.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:46.060]   I feel like it's a very dynamic thing.
[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:51.060]   It's like, I'm at least aware, for me personally,
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:54.960]   of the beauty between humans,
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.800]   of the dance of the push and pull,
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:05:59.640]   of the different moods.
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:01.200]   It's like a dynamical system.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:04.880]   It's not two static entities fully represented
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:07.120]   and consistent through every interaction.
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:08.720]   Sometimes, you know,
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:13.160]   people might confuse the fact that I often talk about love,
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:17.480]   and I love humans, that I don't have a temper,
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:20.880]   that I don't have, like, I lose my shit all the time,
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.800]   especially on things I really am passionate about,
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:26.440]   like people I work with and so on.
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.200]   I'm all over the place.
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:30.760]   But underneath it, there's a deep love and respect
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:32.960]   for humans, but I lose my shit all the time.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.600]   And that chaos, that rollercoaster,
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:41.200]   I think that's what makes human relations awesome.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:43.480]   I mean, the push and pull of it.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.980]   Of course, it can oscillate too far,
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:48.880]   which is when it becomes Amber Heard type of situation,
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:51.640]   when it turns to emotional or physical violence,
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:55.920]   when it turns to jealousy, crosses a line where it's hurtful
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:00.920]   and there's like, it crosses that vast gray landscape
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:06.840]   of what is abuse versus what is just beautiful turmoil
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:11.640]   of human nature, right?
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.040]   - Yes, yeah.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.560]   - And it's complicated, yeah.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:18.400]   - Yeah, it's complicated and it's dynamic,
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.560]   and I would just add to that.
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.520]   I thought you phrased that brilliantly,
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.920]   but I would just add to that.
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:27.720]   It also depends on sort of what you're trying to do.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:32.120]   And so I think some of the oscillation can be what task,
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.480]   what problem you're trying to solve.
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.440]   And so if you're, I don't know,
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:40.160]   trying to build a bridge or something,
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.960]   you need to be very thing oriented
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:47.920]   and make sure the damn thing actually works
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.280]   and doesn't collapse when a car goes over it.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:55.520]   If you're trying to form a relationship,
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.640]   and you're entirely thing oriented,
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:07:59.840]   it's not gonna work.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.120]   And that's one of the people,
[02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:06.320]   one of the things with, and males tend to be more
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:10.360]   on the so-called spectrum side of things
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:13.400]   where one of the hallmarks is a deficit
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:16.200]   in social mind reading.
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:17.560]   It's just to add to your point about,
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:18.600]   I guess I've already made it,
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:22.800]   of the dynamic properties of the roller coaster
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.520]   is depending on what problem you're trying to solve,
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:27.640]   you might wanna toggle back and forth
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:29.840]   to one pole or the other.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.680]   - You wrote a book called "Why Women Have Sex,
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:37.680]   Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge,"
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.480]   that sounds fun, "and Everything in Between."
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:42.160]   So why do women have sex?
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:44.680]   - Well, I co-wrote it with a female,
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:48.680]   who is Cindy Meston, a wonderful friend and colleague
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:51.840]   and co-author and co-collaborator.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:55.160]   I wouldn't be presumptuous enough to write a book
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:59.120]   called "Why Women Have Sex" by myself as a male.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.080]   - Did you contribute anything to this book?
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:02.600]   I'm just kidding.
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:04.760]   - I did, but I have to tell you a story
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.040]   about the origins of this idea,
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.600]   which I give credit to Cindy Meston for.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.920]   And we were, she's a colleague
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.000]   in the psychology department with me,
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.040]   and we would go out to dinner once a week or so,
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.920]   and we were just talking about this, she raised this issue.
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.320]   And so we started to brainstorm.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.360]   Originally, it was why humans have sex,
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.640]   and that's the scientific article we published
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:32.000]   was why humans, 'cause we're interested in males and females.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.080]   And so I said, I would come up,
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.200]   "Well, they have sex because of X."
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.280]   And then Cindy Meston would come up, she'd say,
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.360]   "Oh, here's seven other reasons."
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.680]   And then I'd come up with one more,
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:45.080]   and she'd come up with another seven.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:48.920]   And so it was like, so she's in some sense,
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:53.920]   importantly, the originator or fountain of this idea.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:57.040]   - Oh, so she's able, there's something
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:59.240]   about the way she thinks about sexuality
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:02.280]   that's able to deeply introspect about reasons for sex.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.200]   - Yeah, and probably especially about female sexuality.
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:07.800]   And this is one of the interesting things,
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.440]   and why it's so fun for me to collaborate with,
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.600]   in this case, female, because they do have
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:17.560]   a different sexual psychology than males.
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:21.080]   And I've noticed this, that's why in my graduate,
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:24.360]   so I've had 30 or so PhD students,
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.040]   about half have been male, half have been female,
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.920]   and the women come up with different questions,
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.480]   different scientific questions
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.300]   that I wouldn't have thought of necessarily.
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:39.920]   And so anyway, so it turned out to be a good collaboration.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.280]   I will say that we co-wrote it,
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:44.160]   and that I did contribute to it.
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:45.640]   - Good. (laughs)
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:50.520]   - And especially the evolutionary insights.
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:52.640]   - So is there a good few words you can say
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:56.880]   to why women have sex?
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:58.760]   What are some primary motivations?
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:03.760]   - Well, we originally came up with a list of 237 reasons
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:09.280]   for why humans have sex, and they range from,
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.240]   you know, some of the obvious ones,
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:17.240]   because it feels good, because I want it to relieve stress,
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.760]   to relieve menstrual cramps, to get rid of a headache,
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:24.680]   to get my boyfriend off my back
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.160]   so I could get some work done.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.640]   So things like that.
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.760]   To others, like, here's another one,
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:34.920]   so that he'd take out the damn garbage.
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.920]   It was kind of interesting that one nomination
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:43.880]   was to get closer to God.
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:48.480]   So there were some that were kind of spiritual motivations
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:49.960]   for having sex.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:53.120]   And then some of the nastier ones, like to get revenge
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:57.080]   on my partner, or to get revenge on a rival.
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:02.080]   So that's like sleeping with my rival's boyfriend.
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.480]   So there's some nasty stuff and some good stuff in there.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.200]   - It's so fascinating, because, yeah,
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:11.600]   sex has such a powerful role in our psychology,
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.200]   but also in our culture.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:16.520]   So you can make significant statements
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.520]   in the status hierarchy about your sex,
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.400]   the selection of your sexual partner.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.680]   It's interesting, so it's not just 'cause you're horny.
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:29.200]   It's all those other kinds of things.
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:31.320]   - Yeah, well, hornyness is one.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.120]   But there are other reasons.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.360]   What about different kinds of sex?
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:41.800]   Again, this is not the "Humor in the Lab" podcast.
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:45.360]   Rough sex versus, quote, "making love."
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.360]   What's the explanation between all of that?
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:48.720]   All the various kink?
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.200]   Now, that's just a basic sort of split,
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.920]   but all the different kinks that humans establish,
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:57.320]   all the different fantasies and all those kinds of things.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.180]   - Yeah, well, that's a complicated question,
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:04.840]   for which I don't think we have sufficient time
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:07.080]   to get into that in detail.
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:08.440]   And it is complicated,
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:12.440]   because there are some sexual fantasies that,
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:13.520]   sexual fantasies, by the way,
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:15.520]   I think are a really fascinating window
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.720]   into our sexual psychology,
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.840]   because in a way, they're unconstrained
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.120]   by things like rules and norms in society
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.100]   and cultural presses that you're kind of free
[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:31.920]   to fantasize about whatever you want to fantasize about.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:34.240]   So I think it provides an interesting window
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:35.800]   into human sexuality.
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.240]   And there are some predictable ones,
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:42.760]   and then there are some also individual
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:44.320]   or idiosyncratic ones.
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:49.320]   And again, there's a fundamental sex difference in this,
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:54.880]   in that when you talk about fetishes
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.480]   or like shoe fetishes, leather fetishes,
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.880]   different types of things,
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.880]   males are much more prone to those than females.
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.280]   - Shoe fetish, you said?
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:10.840]   - Shoe fetish, almost all fetishes.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:13.440]   Males are overrepresented.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:17.400]   And I think it's partly because there's some evidence
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.120]   that they're classically conditioned.
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.680]   So I think that first or early sexual experiences
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:25.960]   that people have kind of condition them
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:29.800]   to the cues that are present during those early ones.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:32.520]   And so if your first sexual experience happened to be,
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:36.760]   involve visual images of shoes,
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:38.160]   or you're having to look in your shoes
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.880]   when you first had sex,
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:41.000]   that's just an example,
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.140]   or leather or zippers or whatever the case is,
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:49.040]   that people develop these very individualistic
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.920]   sexual turn-ons based on these early sexual experiences.
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.960]   - So it could also be, you said have sex,
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:59.640]   but it could also be sexual feelings,
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:01.000]   early sexual feelings.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.280]   So I wonder what that is about men,
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:08.480]   that they have a more,
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:10.760]   when they first start experiencing sexual feelings,
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.560]   that they're more sensitive to the cues,
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:16.520]   and those cues somehow have a deep psychological effect
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.560]   on their development of their sexuality.
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:19.880]   So if they have kinks,
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.200]   that means they're somehow more cue-sensitive,
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.680]   and maybe, does the matter of society
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:28.480]   like slap someone on the wrist for it?
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:31.640]   Does that help solidify the kinks?
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.840]   - Yeah, I don't know about the society
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:34.800]   slapping on the wrist,
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:37.040]   but I think what it is is this,
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.920]   I think this is the evolutionary hypothesis anyway
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:42.840]   about why there's this sex difference.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.160]   And that is that men are conditioned
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.280]   to anything that's gonna lead to sex,
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:53.360]   because whereas women don't have to be.
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:56.800]   From a male perspective,
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:59.280]   because of women's greater investment,
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:02.600]   because the nine-month pregnancy, et cetera,
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:05.080]   in order to reproduce,
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.720]   women have to invest this tremendous amount.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.640]   Men don't.
[02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:11.840]   One act of sex can produce an offspring,
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.120]   and so for men, but not for women.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.000]   And so this huge asymmetry in investment
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.720]   means that the payoff matrix
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:26.760]   of different sexual strategies differs for the sexes.
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:29.840]   In that context, women become the valuable
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:33.000]   and scarce resource over which men compete.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.920]   So anything that leads to successful sex
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:37.480]   is gonna be selected for it.
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.040]   And so men are very sensitive to being sexually conditioned.
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:44.080]   That's what's called sexual conditioning,
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:47.960]   to whatever cues are associated with sex happening.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:54.040]   From a woman's perspective, sex is not a scarce resource.
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:57.560]   So a woman could go out here in Austin
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:01.600]   any night or probably any day on 6th Street
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.600]   and have no problem having sex with a guy within 10 minutes.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:11.840]   Guy would have more difficulty.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:14.920]   He's not gonna go out,
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.160]   unless he's Johnny Depp or really, really charming.
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:23.440]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a fascinating dimorphism
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:27.320]   or asymmetry in our mate selection.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:31.560]   What do you think is the effect on this young male brain,
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.840]   but female too, of pornography?
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:35.760]   So one of the fascinating things
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.360]   that the digital world brought us,
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:44.360]   now I grew up at a time when a magazine,
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.400]   like a Victoria's Secret magazine
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:51.400]   was my source of sexual inspiration.
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:55.640]   But that was before the internet.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:57.440]   And now the internet with pornography
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:59.520]   makes it extremely accessible.
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.280]   All kinds of kinks, all kinds of wild variety.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:07.880]   I mean, variety in quantity is immense.
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.160]   So what do you think that has,
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:16.840]   how that affects mate selection, mating,
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:21.840]   and just the human psychology of the two sexes of the species?
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:26.280]   - Yeah, great question, a big question.
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:30.280]   So, I mean, we could have a whole podcast just on that
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:31.800]   or at least talk for a while about it.
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:34.400]   So I'll just say a couple of things about that.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:37.400]   One is, again, there's a sex difference.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:39.280]   And I feel like I'm a broken record here,
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.360]   hammering on this, but it is--
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:43.320]   - So a lot of, just to actually echo the thing,
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:46.520]   please be a broken record, 'cause it's interesting.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:48.660]   The more we get to the mating,
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:53.640]   the more there's sex differences present themselves.
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:55.080]   They surface. - Yeah, that's right.
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:57.240]   And in many psychological domains,
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.080]   there are no sex differences, or the sexes are very similar.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:03.040]   But pornography is consumed,
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:06.020]   about 80% of the consumers are men.
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:10.200]   So it is very heavily a male consumer industry,
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.520]   if you will.
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:18.520]   And I think that it can have positive and negative effects
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:21.920]   depending on the circumstance.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:26.680]   So one potential negative effect
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.680]   is that men might develop unrealistic expectations
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:35.560]   about what sex will be like or should be like
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.120]   in real life.
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:39.900]   And so I remember actually this,
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:42.460]   I just heard about this one case of,
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:47.020]   won't mention any names, where a man got married
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:52.020]   and he had been accustomed to seeing very large breasts
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:54.380]   in his pornography consumption,
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:59.300]   and discovered that his wife had what he perceived
[02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:01.440]   to be very small breasts.
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:05.460]   In fact, they were actually just medium-sized,
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:10.380]   but because he had been so heavily exposed to pornography
[02:20:10.380 --> 02:20:13.820]   and the artificially enhanced breast size
[02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:16.020]   that is often depicted in pornography,
[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:21.020]   that he had come to expect something that was unrealistic,
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:25.180]   in this case, not leading,
[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:28.060]   that's not the way to lead off to a great sex life
[02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:31.320]   with your wife by being disappointed in her breast size.
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:34.700]   So I think that people can develop,
[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:37.500]   in this case, men unrealistic expectations,
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:40.280]   also about the kind of sexual acrobatics
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.180]   that porn stars engage in,
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:44.900]   and when they get in real life situations
[02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:48.700]   can put pressure on women to become,
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:52.660]   to fulfill those kinds of images.
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:54.820]   But the other thing,
[02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:58.020]   the other kind of detrimental effect that it has is,
[02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:01.980]   and this is something that is emerging culturally,
[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:04.020]   is I think it has a dampening effect
[02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:09.020]   on men's pursuit of real-life relationships,
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.340]   because in some sense,
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:14.100]   it kind of bleeds off some of that sex drive
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.780]   or sexual desire, sexual energy,
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:20.980]   and so they're, and some men get addicted to it,
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:23.180]   so they're spending hours and hours and hours a day
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.600]   consuming pornography,
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:28.660]   and so I think it can have a detrimental effect
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:31.340]   even on men's ambition.
[02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:33.380]   - Yeah, there's something really powerful
[02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:35.100]   about that sexual energy,
[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:37.780]   not to be all spiritual about it,
[02:21:37.780 --> 02:21:42.340]   but it seems like that's somehow correlated with ambition.
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:45.940]   So one of the things that pornography can take away
[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:48.180]   is exactly as you said,
[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:52.820]   is your pursuit of love out there,
[02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:57.380]   including women, but also love of things,
[02:21:57.380 --> 02:22:00.620]   meaning building awesome, epic things,
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:02.820]   so the love of both bridges and women,
[02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:07.580]   bridge building and relationship building.
[02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:10.220]   Yeah, there's something about that energy,
[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:15.220]   and also, yeah, there's a sort of a vicious downward spiral
[02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:20.980]   because it somehow staunts your development
[02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:22.900]   because it limits social interaction,
[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:29.220]   the push and pull of romantic social interaction,
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:31.740]   it cuts the edge off of that,
[02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:33.400]   and it forces you to be,
[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:37.260]   to spend way too much time with yourself
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:40.340]   without the development of that social interaction.
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:41.660]   I don't know, but there,
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:44.820]   so outside of the expectations
[02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:45.780]   on all those kinds of things,
[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:47.180]   it seems to have a detrimental effect
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:50.100]   on the development of the human mind.
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:51.300]   - Yeah. - What is that?
[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:54.020]   I don't, 'cause some of that is echoed
[02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:56.140]   in people talk about the metaverse,
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:59.260]   that some of our life would be in the digital space,
[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:00.620]   and it's like, on one hand,
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:01.940]   well, if it brings you happiness,
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:04.900]   if it brings you joy, short-term and long-term,
[02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:07.660]   why is the metaverse not the same
[02:23:07.660 --> 02:23:09.980]   or better than the real world?
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:12.740]   But there is something still missing, and what is that?
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:17.140]   Something of the pleasure you feel with porn
[02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:21.340]   is still missing, it's really not representing
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:23.780]   some of the fundamental pleasure you feel
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:26.100]   when you interact with real people,
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:29.300]   and that could be just the growth you experience.
[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.460]   Like, real people can reject you.
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:32.300]   (Dave laughs)
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:35.420]   The challenge, again, the push and pull,
[02:23:35.420 --> 02:23:37.220]   all of that, the dance of human relations.
[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:41.260]   - Yeah, yeah, and the exploration of your sexuality.
[02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:46.060]   So on porn, you can kind of passively explore
[02:23:46.060 --> 02:23:49.940]   because you can see, as you mentioned,
[02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:53.860]   a wide variety of things, and people do that,
[02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:57.780]   but in terms of exploring your own sexuality,
[02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:01.940]   I think there's no replacement for a real human being.
[02:24:01.940 --> 02:24:03.300]   - So you've written about violence,
[02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:06.300]   and here we're talking about porn and sex.
[02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:07.420]   I don't know if you have thoughts on this,
[02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:11.940]   but I'd love to ask your opinion on, quote, incels.
[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:14.180]   So here I would like to quote Wikipedia
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:18.340]   that define incels as members of an online subculture
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:19.860]   of people who define themselves
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:22.660]   as unable to get a romantic or sexual partner
[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:24.540]   despite desiring one.
[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:27.620]   They also write, now, I don't know if Wikipedia
[02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:31.340]   is the accurate source about incels, but here it is.
[02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:34.060]   They write, quote, "At least eight mass murders
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:36.340]   "resulting in a total of 61 deaths
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:39.420]   "have been committed since 2014 by men
[02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:42.180]   "who have either self-identified as incels
[02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:45.900]   "or who had mentioned incel-related names and writings
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:48.620]   "in their private writings or internet postings.
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:50.300]   "Incel communities have been criticized
[02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:53.740]   "by researchers and the media for being misogynistic,
[02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:56.460]   "encouraging violence, spreading extremist views,
[02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:59.900]   "and radicalizing their members."
[02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:02.140]   Is there some insight that you draw
[02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:06.180]   from this connection of sex and lack of sex to violence?
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:11.180]   - Well, I think sex and violence are linked
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:16.420]   in various ways, and it's not just incels.
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:24.300]   So if you look at serial killers, for example,
[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:30.540]   and this is another thing that I've,
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:34.460]   true crime is kind of an avocation of mine.
[02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:36.380]   I just enjoy reading about true crime
[02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:37.820]   and following true crime stories.
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:38.760]   - It's an avocation.
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:40.940]   - Hobby. - A hobby.
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:42.860]   - Side interest.
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:46.020]   - Super fancy word for hobby, I got it, cool.
[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:48.100]   - That, like Ted Bundy,
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.940]   he was actually very charming
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:53.580]   and didn't have any trouble attracting women,
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:57.380]   but his killing spree started shortly
[02:25:57.380 --> 02:26:01.900]   after he was rejected by a very high-status,
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:06.780]   attractive woman, and he felt a rage
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:10.540]   about being rejected by her.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.420]   Now, who knows, that's an N of one,
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:16.860]   and we don't know if being rejected
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:18.780]   causes serial killing per se,
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:22.820]   but sex and violence are related in different ways.
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:29.200]   I argue, and I haven't studied the incel community
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:32.660]   in detail, I actually have an incoming graduate student
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:33.940]   who's gonna start in the fall
[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:36.420]   who has been studying the incels,
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:39.020]   and so he'll have a more informed picture,
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:42.660]   but my attitude is there are ways
[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:44.260]   to improve your mate value.
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:46.800]   If you're having trouble attracting a mate,
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:48.580]   there are ways to improve your mate value,
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:52.380]   because a lot of things that women want in a mate
[02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:53.900]   are improvable.
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:59.500]   Women want guys who are compassionate,
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:03.900]   who are understanding, who are ambitious,
[02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:06.380]   who acquire resources, et cetera,
[02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:08.500]   who are physically fit.
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:11.180]   There are things you can do to improve your mate value,
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:13.420]   and so I would say, rather than,
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:17.060]   I would encourage incels or the incel communities,
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:19.340]   rather than being hostile toward women
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:20.840]   or being angry at women,
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.420]   just do things to improve your mate value,
[02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:27.900]   and then you will be more successful at attracting women.
[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:29.900]   - Yeah, I mean, some of it, that's a fascinating,
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:32.500]   so your student will be studying that.
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:36.600]   Listen, I love the internet.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:38.980]   The internet always wins,
[02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:40.460]   and there's a fascinating aspect to it,
[02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:42.300]   which is just humor,
[02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:45.640]   and I'm fascinated by seeing the humor,
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:48.560]   whether it's 4chan or Reddit and all that kind of stuff,
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:53.040]   where people maybe will self-identify as incels as a joke,
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:55.520]   as a kind of, basically representing the fact
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:57.480]   that it's hard to get women.
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:27:59.280]   This is the struggle, the struggle,
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:02.480]   and for women, it's hard to get a mate that they,
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.600]   they're basically jokingly representing the challenges,
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:09.160]   the difficulty of the mate selection process,
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:12.740]   that the desirable group is smaller than the entire group.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:14.740]   That's it, and they're joking about it,
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:17.580]   but then it's interesting how quickly humor,
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:23.700]   again, a dynamical system, it can turn into anger,
[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:27.060]   and that, on the internet, is so interesting to watch,
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:31.940]   like how trolling, light trolling, is humor,
[02:28:31.940 --> 02:28:34.300]   but it can turn into aggression,
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.320]   and I've just seen, it's weird.
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:42.800]   It's weird how, this is true on the internet,
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.960]   but you also just look at the dark aspects
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:48.460]   of the 20th century that I've been reading a lot about,
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:53.460]   how kind of lighthearted things turn dark quickly,
[02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:56.560]   and it's interesting.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:58.080]   I don't know what to make of it,
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:01.060]   because it's basically sexual frustration
[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:05.920]   that all humans feel, it's dating in general,
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:08.760]   can turn into anger,
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:14.680]   can turn into sophisticated philosophical constructs,
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:17.600]   like about how the world works,
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.200]   of who really is pulling the strings,
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:24.360]   and that turns some of the worst crimes committed
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:26.160]   by the Nazis, for example,
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:28.600]   or by extremely intelligent people,
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:32.980]   that constructed models of how the world works,
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:36.580]   and there's something about sexual frustration
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:38.400]   is one of the really powerful forces
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:40.980]   that could be a catalyst for constructing such models,
[02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:42.380]   and once you've done that,
[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:46.260]   shit gets a lot more serious,
[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:49.060]   and it's no longer joke, it's serious,
[02:29:49.060 --> 02:29:51.260]   but at the same time, when you just look from the surface,
[02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:52.340]   it's kind of jokes.
[02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:53.660]   - Yeah. - It's just weird.
[02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:56.140]   - That's interesting points that you're making.
[02:29:56.140 --> 02:30:00.680]   I think that this is one way in which evolution
[02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:05.680]   has built into us a feature
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:10.040]   which is really bad for our overall happiness,
[02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:13.320]   and that is that it's created desires
[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:15.800]   that can never be fully met,
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:18.440]   and that includes in the mating domain,
[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:22.160]   so even with people who are successful in attracting
[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:25.680]   somewhat desirable mates, maybe they want,
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:28.820]   you know, Giselle Bündchen or some,
[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:32.900]   you know, they desire things that are,
[02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:34.780]   women that are higher in mate value
[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:38.660]   or a larger number of partners
[02:30:38.660 --> 02:30:40.540]   than they can successfully attract,
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:43.700]   and in a way, I mean, these serve as,
[02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:45.020]   evolution's built into these
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:47.540]   because they're motivational devices.
[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:50.380]   They motivate us to try to get what we want,
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.520]   but it also makes us miserable
[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:54.760]   or at least unhappy or dissatisfied
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:58.280]   because there are desires that can never be fulfilled,
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:01.300]   and this is, to mention one more sex difference,
[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:03.860]   this desire for sexual variety,
[02:31:03.860 --> 02:31:05.720]   meaning a variety of different partners,
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:08.160]   is much, much greater in men than in women,
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:12.120]   and so that's why even like in pornography consumption,
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:14.560]   men will, like, you know, go through
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:17.840]   multiple, multiple, multiple images
[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:22.400]   and sex scenes and so forth compared to what women
[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:24.500]   who consume pornography go through,
[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:27.780]   but this desire for sexual variety
[02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:31.360]   is something that makes men miserable
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.840]   because it's something that they can't,
[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:36.720]   most men, unless you're a king or a despot
[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:41.680]   or, you know, have a harem,
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:45.320]   it's something that can never be fulfilled in everyday life,
[02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:48.360]   and so I even think that, you know,
[02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:52.080]   you talk to men who are walking down a city block
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:55.800]   in Austin or New York City or San Francisco or wherever,
[02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:59.640]   and they pass by, they could pass by six women
[02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:02.960]   and feel a sexual attraction to six different women
[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:05.400]   in one city block, you know?
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.360]   (Dave laughs)
[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:09.720]   Now, and so this is, again, where evolution
[02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:13.920]   has created in this desires that can never be fully met.
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:15.040]   - It's the evolution.
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:16.520]   Well, it's useful, right?
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:18.840]   And the hilarious thing, this always,
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:22.480]   by my own mind, by just observing people,
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:27.480]   once you get that 10 or that beautiful woman
[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:29.880]   that you've been lost, you take her for granted
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:31.240]   and you move on to the next thing.
[02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:33.560]   - There are classic cases like,
[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:36.000]   I don't know if you remember this case,
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.040]   but Hugh Grant was with Elizabeth Hurley,
[02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:43.600]   who is a gorgeous model, and he was caught having sex
[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:46.080]   with a prostitute, I think it was in LA or whatever,
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:48.800]   and he's got Elizabeth Hurley,
[02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:51.120]   why are you having sex with a prostitute?
[02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:54.960]   But it's the male desire for sexual variety.
[02:32:54.960 --> 02:33:00.680]   - Well, let me do a little bit of a tangent here
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:05.240]   and ask you about just your work in general
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:08.760]   in terms of its interaction with the scientific community
[02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:10.400]   and with the world at large.
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:12.840]   So many of the ideas you do research on
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:14.200]   are pretty controversial,
[02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:18.240]   or at least the topic is controversial somehow.
[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:19.760]   Maybe you can speak to that.
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:23.120]   But what are your thoughts in the current climate
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:26.880]   of cancel culture, or maybe there's a better term for it,
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:29.080]   that word is like loaded now,
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:33.880]   about you doing research in this space
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:37.960]   that is so essential, so crucial
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:40.280]   to understanding human nature?
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:42.800]   What are the difficulties, what are the concerns for you?
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:45.080]   To be able to freely explore.
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:49.760]   - Yeah, I've been doing research on these things.
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.760]   So when you combine sex or sexuality
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:34:01.440]   with sex differences, with evolution,
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:05.000]   each of these topics are controversial by themselves,
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.480]   and you bring them together,
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.240]   the intersection becomes especially controversial.
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:15.280]   But I guess view myself as a scientist,
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:21.560]   and so I would rather be scientifically correct
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:25.280]   than politically correct, if you will.
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:29.720]   So I have no interest in, I don't have an agenda,
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:31.240]   I don't have a political agenda,
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.800]   I don't have any agenda other than discovering human nature.
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:39.800]   That's what I've devoted my scientific career toward,
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:42.280]   and that's why I do the studies
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:44.120]   in response to empirical data,
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:48.040]   and the best theories that we have available,
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:49.920]   the best conceptual tools.
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:54.000]   So do some of these things upset people?
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.280]   Yeah, yeah, they do.
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:59.060]   As a matter of fact, even early in my career,
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:02.480]   before I started publishing on some of these things,
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:05.000]   I gave a talk in the sociology department.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.920]   This was at University of Michigan,
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.240]   and a female professor came up to me afterwards and said,
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:12.800]   you know, you really shouldn't publish
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:14.380]   the results of your studies.
[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:16.360]   And I said, why not?
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:21.240]   And she said that women have it hard enough as it is
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:24.560]   without knowing about these things.
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:28.760]   And my view is that's naive.
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:32.560]   I think suppression of scientific knowledge is a bad thing,
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:34.920]   and suppression of scientific knowledge
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.360]   about sex differences is a bad thing.
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:41.600]   Men and women are not psychological clones,
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.480]   especially when it comes to the mating domain
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:45.840]   and sexuality domain.
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:49.240]   The only other domain that shows massive sex differences
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:52.280]   that we haven't touched on is aggression and violence.
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:57.280]   So the leading cause of violence is being a male.
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:00.480]   Males have, and the more extreme the violence,
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:02.320]   the more males have a monopoly on it.
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:05.480]   So when you get to homicide, warfare,
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:06.920]   males have a monopoly on it.
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.280]   And we need to understand human nature,
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:13.400]   and we need to understand sex differences therein
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:17.680]   in order to be in a position to effectively solve
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:19.400]   some of the social problems
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:21.280]   that these sex differences create.
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:27.360]   So, you know, so I've been gotten some flack.
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:32.280]   No one's tried to cancel me in my work so far.
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:33.680]   So I'm--
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:34.640]   - Just wait.
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:36.320]   - Yeah, just--
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.880]   - But does it hurt you personally?
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:41.040]   Just is it psychologically difficult to do this work?
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:44.200]   'Cause what is research is thinking deeply through things
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:49.200]   and like doing studies, but also interpreting them
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:52.840]   and thinking through what is the right questions to ask.
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:54.320]   What does this mean?
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:56.600]   And for that, you have to have a clear mind,
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:01.800]   an optimistic mind, a free mind, and all of that.
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:03.440]   So you're just a human.
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:06.160]   So psychologically, is it difficult?
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.240]   Does it wear on you?
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:10.640]   - Yeah, I would say not really,
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:13.400]   but I've been, I think, fortunate.
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:15.680]   So even say my latest book,
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.800]   I published a book recently on conflict between the sexes.
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:22.200]   And it deals with very controversial topics,
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:24.840]   including intimate partner violence,
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:28.360]   like with the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard thing.
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:30.240]   And I don't talk about that in the book,
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.240]   but, and it's been largely well-received.
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:40.800]   And I think partly it's because I am careful
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:44.160]   in my publications not to endorse it.
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:46.280]   So one of the common conflations that people make
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.200]   is they think that it's something that you think is good.
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:53.800]   If you find a sex difference,
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:55.280]   that there should be a sex difference.
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:57.000]   This is the is-ought confusion.
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:01.120]   And so I try to make it very clear
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.040]   that I'm studying what is not what ought to be.
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.920]   And a lot of things that I discover about what is the case,
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:13.280]   I would prefer them not to be.
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:15.560]   And I think you kind of alluded to this earlier
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:19.360]   by saying that we have to override
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:23.280]   some of our violent inclinations or impulses,
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:26.620]   or the way I would phrase it is we have to,
[02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:29.180]   - Control them?
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:33.140]   - Control or keep quiescent or suppress
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:37.020]   some of the nastier sides of human nature.
[02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:39.980]   And we've successfully done that in some domains.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:44.380]   So you can talk about, like one group that fascinates me
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:48.020]   is the Vikings and the whole, that whole era.
[02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:55.260]   And so you have in Sweden, Norway, for example,
[02:38:56.260 --> 02:39:00.900]   these have like the lowest homicide rates on earth.
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:06.300]   But you go back 400 years ago, 600 years ago,
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:08.600]   people were killing each other right and left.
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:14.780]   And so finding that, so this leads me to be optimistic
[02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:19.180]   that we can change conditions
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:22.700]   to suppress our evolved proclivities.
[02:39:22.700 --> 02:39:26.660]   Just like one physical example that I sometimes use
[02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:29.140]   is callous producing mechanisms.
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:31.060]   We have evolved callous producing mechanisms
[02:39:31.060 --> 02:39:32.500]   that are very valuable.
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.620]   We develop thickness in the areas of our skin
[02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:37.780]   that have experienced repeated friction.
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:41.060]   But we can in principle design environments
[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:43.660]   where we don't experience repeated friction.
[02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:45.860]   And so we won't grow callouses.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:47.660]   And so you've designed an environment
[02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:50.460]   that basically prevents the activation
[02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:52.240]   of our callous producing mechanism.
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:53.540]   I think we can do the same thing
[02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:55.820]   with some of these other inclinations
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:01.780]   and have succeeded in reductions of homicide
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:04.620]   even in the last couple hundred years.
[02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:06.820]   - And some of that has to do with the myths and stories
[02:40:06.820 --> 02:40:08.900]   we tell ourselves, like again, it's language.
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:10.800]   'Cause I mean, I love the Vikings.
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.900]   Valhalla, that idea.
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:17.720]   That's a myth, that's an idea,
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:23.280]   that's a promise for the great land beyond,
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.240]   over there beyond the mountains.
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:27.820]   It's like Animal Farm, Sugarcane Mountain,
[02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:32.760]   that is promised to you if you're a great warrior.
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:36.200]   I believe Valhalla is where half the soldiers go
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:42.040]   as a reward for great soldiering, for being great warriors.
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:44.200]   And the thing I just recently have been reading
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:45.360]   quite a bit about Valhalla,
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:48.280]   which is it's such a fascinating
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:50.420]   how these myths are constructed.
[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:57.140]   I believe, I just think this is such an awesome setup
[02:40:57.140 --> 02:40:59.480]   in terms of a kind of heaven,
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:02.240]   which is they spend the entire day fighting
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:09.520]   for joy, and if they die, they're reborn the next day.
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:13.080]   So it's, you're basically the passion,
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:15.640]   the thing you're passionate about without the consequences.
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:19.120]   On top of that, I think there's a pig or a boar
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.760]   that is, they keep eating.
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.560]   So it's regenerated every single day.
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:29.820]   So unlimited food, and there's unlimited beer, I believe.
[02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:31.680]   So it's like-- - Or mead, maybe.
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:34.280]   - Mead, mead, yes, yes, yes, it's mead.
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:35.880]   I don't know, that's fascinating
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:37.520]   that we construct these myths.
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:38.820]   And at the same time,
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:45.480]   these myths can be used to get humans
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:48.080]   to do some of the worst atrocities.
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:51.760]   So some of the violence requires us to have those myths
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:54.160]   of what is waiting for us beyond death,
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:57.880]   sort of beyond over there in Sugarcandy Mountain,
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:00.840]   as Crow says that in Animal Farm.
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:05.000]   And so I think the more and more in this modern society,
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000]   the positive of not constructing so many myths
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:09.800]   is that we get to live more in the moment,
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:12.960]   and that forces us to optimize and improve the moment,
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:16.240]   and we get to face the irrational
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:17.760]   and the painful aspect of violence.
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:20.120]   Maybe we should reduce that in the here and now.
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:22.120]   Yeah, the downside is we may not,
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:25.240]   if we dispose of God or these kinds of religious
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:29.520]   and spiritual ideas, we might descend into,
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:32.080]   we need to worry about with nihilism.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:33.480]   And it's a beautiful dance,
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:35.320]   'cause humans seem to tie themselves together
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:37.360]   with narratives. - Yes, yeah.
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:40.400]   - And with myths and stories that we all believe,
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:42.160]   if you completely dispose of them,
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.000]   society, I don't know, we don't know.
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:46.920]   We don't know what's going to happen,
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:48.000]   if it's going to collapse,
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.760]   or if it's actually going to rediscover better myths,
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.400]   better stories, more scientifically grounded ones,
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:57.360]   ones that are driven in data and all those kinds of things.
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:59.840]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:01.760]   I mean, it's an interesting question.
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:05.440]   I mean, I don't have any brilliant insights into it
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:08.600]   other than that, to agree with you,
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:12.600]   that people construct narratives,
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:13.920]   well, of their own lives,
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:17.040]   and sometimes the life after death.
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:19.520]   But I guess I would add,
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:21.640]   and this is maybe a more cynical view,
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:23.520]   but you mentioned atrocities.
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:28.520]   I think that leaders can sometimes exploit those under them
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:36.680]   to create forms of violence or justification for warfare.
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:45.760]   Like in the group that we are conquering,
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:49.160]   they are a subhuman, they're insects,
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:52.640]   they're an infectious disease that is,
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.800]   and so these narratives can be used by leaders
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:01.040]   to exploit and motivate people under them
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:03.560]   to commit these atrocities.
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:07.640]   So it's a nastier part of our psychology,
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:09.000]   both that leaders do that,
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.400]   but also that people are vulnerable
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:13.400]   to narratives of that sort.
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:15.960]   - Yeah, it's fascinating to look pre-internet.
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:18.960]   You hope the internet makes us more resistant to that,
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:21.200]   which I do have probably a question on that.
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:23.720]   But if you look at just the propaganda machines
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:25.280]   during World War II,
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:28.680]   on the Nazi side and on the Soviet side,
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:32.160]   on every side, but particularly in those two,
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:35.000]   it's so fascinating both how effective
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:38.960]   a simple message can be in a leader being able
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:42.340]   to convince the small inner circle around them,
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:47.440]   convince themselves, which is fascinating, propaganda,
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:50.000]   and you start to believe the propaganda you generate,
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.800]   and then how easily the populace is convincible.
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:56.280]   Again, you hope that the internet,
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:44:58.280]   the distributed nature of the internet
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:01.920]   makes it more difficult to run a propaganda campaign,
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:03.560]   at least of the classical sort.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:05.680]   I do have a question about this,
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:07.360]   'cause you mentioned Elon Musk.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:09.800]   When we're talking about status hierarchies,
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:11.360]   like you and I can't buy Twitter.
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:13.720]   - And we're a wealth accumulation, yeah.
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:16.340]   - What do you think about Elon buying Twitter,
[02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:22.200]   in particular, in the reason, the state of reason,
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.280]   that he's doing so in emphasizing free speech?
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:27.360]   - That's an interesting question,
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:30.280]   but I don't really have an informed opinion about it.
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:34.640]   I don't know, it's not my area of expertise,
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:37.280]   and I don't know enough details,
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:40.920]   and I also don't know what his plans are for Twitter,
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:44.760]   what changes he proposes to implement.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:47.400]   - Well, the reason I bring that up is because,
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:49.880]   and you've kind of said you don't necessarily
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:51.800]   feel a tremendous amount of pressure,
[02:45:51.800 --> 02:45:54.440]   but in doing controversial research,
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:57.760]   in doing research on controversial topics,
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.160]   you're also a communicator,
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:03.120]   and Twitter is a platform in which you communicate,
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:05.440]   and there's going to be, if you get canceled somewhere,
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:07.040]   you get canceled on Twitter.
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:09.440]   - Yeah. - And so, there's pressure.
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:14.280]   So what does free speech look like in these public platforms?
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:16.540]   It's communicating difficult ideas.
[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:19.560]   It's changing your mind, it's exploring ideas,
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:22.860]   and not fearing the mob.
[02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:27.460]   The mob that pressures the platform
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:29.540]   to remove you from the platform,
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:33.100]   or to ban you, shadow ban you from the platform,
[02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:36.140]   decrease your reach artificially on the platform.
[02:46:36.140 --> 02:46:38.140]   And those are really fascinating questions
[02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:41.660]   that we get to deal with in this new digital age.
[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:43.860]   So there's a lot of ideas.
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:46.100]   You said what Elon is planning to do.
[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:48.740]   Forget Elon, how do you do this well?
[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.260]   That's the question.
[02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:52.780]   And there's sort of an absolutist view of free speech,
[02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:54.580]   let anyone say anything.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:57.220]   And I tend to be a person that believes
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:46:59.700]   everybody should have the freedom to say anything.
[02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:02.260]   The question with a social media platform is,
[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:07.260]   well, can you force anyone to hear what you have to say?
[02:47:07.260 --> 02:47:13.740]   Because the virality, the viral nature of communication
[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:18.740]   means that you can control who hears what you say.
[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:23.340]   The virality of that, the search and discovery aspect.
[02:47:23.340 --> 02:47:25.620]   And I think that's a fascinating question
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:27.620]   from the algorithmic perspective.
[02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:29.500]   The amount of data out there, just like papers,
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:30.980]   there's a huge amount of papers.
[02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:35.400]   What you want is to find the best papers,
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:36.880]   the ones you agree with,
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:39.040]   but also the ones that challenge you.
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:41.540]   And you don't want to nonstop read
[02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:42.740]   the papers that challenge you.
[02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:44.620]   You're going to be mentally exhausted.
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:48.040]   There's a bucket of attention and focus
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.900]   and mental energy you can allocate.
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:51.540]   The ones that really challenge you,
[02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:54.040]   the ideas that really challenge you are exhausting.
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:54.880]   It's good.
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:56.720]   Just like going to the gym, it's good.
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:48:01.280]   But then you also want to read things that are fun for you.
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:02.720]   And those are, you know,
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:06.920]   if you're spending your whole life in arguments,
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:07.960]   that's going to be exhausting.
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:10.080]   You want to hang out, chill with your friends,
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:13.880]   watch some Netflix, have fun, whatever, easygoing.
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:16.680]   And sometimes have difficult academic arguments
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:19.040]   with people, for example, with people you disagree with,
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:20.480]   but not all the time.
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:22.080]   And you have to have a platform.
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:24.000]   What does free speech actually looks like?
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.360]   It's a platform where everybody can challenge anybody,
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:31.380]   but not destroy them by doing so mentally.
[02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:35.040]   So you have to balance personal growth
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:37.380]   of each individual person on the platform.
[02:48:37.380 --> 02:48:39.960]   But definitely removing people from a platform
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:41.400]   is a terrible thing.
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:44.160]   So on top of that, it's like,
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:49.160]   how do you get measures that the platform is doing good?
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:52.280]   What I really like what Elon said,
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:53.720]   and I've talked to him about this,
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:57.560]   is pissing off everybody equally,
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.680]   the extremes of every side equally.
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:00.680]   In the political spectrum,
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:02.360]   you could say the left and the right
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:06.400]   is measuring by pissing off the extremes equally,
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:09.340]   because currently there seems to be an asymmetry in that.
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:12.000]   So that's one good measure that allows you to maximize,
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.640]   as he says, the area under the curve of human happiness.
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:18.200]   That's one thing.
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:23.200]   The other is people representing themselves honestly.
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.360]   So removing the bots from the platform.
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:26.880]   It's such a weird world we live in,
[02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:29.520]   where you don't know who's real or not.
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.940]   So anonymity is an awesome thing.
[02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:35.880]   The awesome aspect of anonymity
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.600]   is it protects people's privacy.
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.780]   It actually gives them freedom to think,
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:42.380]   freedom to speak even more so.
[02:49:42.380 --> 02:49:45.380]   But when anonymity is weaponized,
[02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:48.560]   it allows you to be cruel to others
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:50.100]   without the repercussion of cruelty
[02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:52.660]   that you would feel in the physical world.
[02:49:52.660 --> 02:49:57.660]   So you wanna use anonymity as a shield versus as a sword.
[02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:00.860]   So to protect yourself from the attacks of others,
[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:02.780]   but not as a way to hurt others.
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:06.100]   And those are all really tricky things to figure out.
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:09.340]   And not all of it's gonna be solved
[02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:10.300]   with an edit button,
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:13.260]   which I believe is the most requested Twitter feature.
[02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:16.940]   Anyway, I think this is fascinating,
[02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:19.980]   not just for people talking about politics,
[02:50:19.980 --> 02:50:21.980]   which is what everyone seems to care about,
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:23.700]   but also for science,
[02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:27.780]   for people challenging each other in the scientific domain.
[02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:30.860]   'Cause I at least have hope for scientific communication,
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:33.540]   where people can start playing around
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:35.100]   with different mediums of communication.
[02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:37.860]   So not just academic papers, but just ideas,
[02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:38.940]   playing with those ideas.
[02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:40.220]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:42.660]   - Especially when you have, so evolution, psychology,
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:46.300]   well, no, even that, it can be super high
[02:50:46.300 --> 02:50:50.220]   turnover rate of importance.
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:52.260]   But you have with COVID,
[02:50:52.260 --> 02:50:55.860]   it seems like the progress of science and scientific debate
[02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:59.140]   is most powerful in that context
[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:00.460]   if it's done really quickly.
[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:01.660]   And it feels like Twitter,
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:04.940]   like most of the best things I've learned about COVID
[02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:08.140]   to stay up to date was on Twitter.
[02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:12.380]   It's so exciting to see science happening so, so, so quickly
[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:13.860]   in all kinds of domains there.
[02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:15.980]   And that was great.
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:19.860]   But then you step in with labels of what's misinformation,
[02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:24.860]   you have this kind of conformity seeking labels
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:29.060]   of what is true and not,
[02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:31.700]   which is a very unscientific thing to me,
[02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:34.060]   in the name of protecting the populace.
[02:51:34.060 --> 02:51:38.540]   It's a weird impulse that people have,
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:40.980]   which is, well, here's an organization,
[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:43.980]   here's an institution that is a possessor of the truth
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:45.820]   and everybody else is untrue.
[02:51:45.820 --> 02:51:49.780]   Now, a lot of the time, maybe majority of the time,
[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:52.340]   that institution is going to be correct.
[02:51:52.340 --> 02:51:55.020]   This consensus, consensus is the consensus
[02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:56.700]   because it's usually correct.
[02:51:56.700 --> 02:52:01.340]   But the biggest ideas are going to be against the consensus.
[02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:04.500]   - And certainly that's true in evolutionary psychology,
[02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:09.460]   where it seems like, are we even, is the cake even baked yet?
[02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:11.620]   It feels like there's a lot of turmoil
[02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:14.220]   in terms of figuring out human psychology.
[02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:16.780]   - Well, there's a lot that we don't know.
[02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:21.780]   I mean, if human psychology, if it were a simple thing
[02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:27.220]   and we only had three or half a dozen
[02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:29.300]   psychological adaptations,
[02:52:29.300 --> 02:52:31.500]   we would have discovered all of them by now.
[02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:35.700]   It's that it's so complex, multifaceted,
[02:52:35.700 --> 02:52:40.700]   multi-mechanism part that describes human nature
[02:52:40.700 --> 02:52:44.860]   that it was what makes it exciting,
[02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:47.900]   but also the amount that we know is small
[02:52:47.900 --> 02:52:49.540]   compared to the amount that we don't know.
[02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:52.580]   And so that's why you have to approach these things
[02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:55.980]   with a certain humility.
[02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:59.280]   And that's why even like in the mating and sexuality domain,
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:02.100]   which I've been studying for a number of years,
[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:05.460]   I keep coming across things that I don't know,
[02:53:05.460 --> 02:53:07.260]   questions that are unanswered,
[02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:12.460]   which makes it exciting from my perspective.
[02:53:12.460 --> 02:53:15.980]   I mean, that's what the joy is of being a scientist.
[02:53:15.980 --> 02:53:21.180]   - You mentioned, I gotta return real quick to Ted Bundy.
[02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:22.340]   You mentioned you have,
[02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:25.580]   so you've written about murder and violence
[02:53:25.580 --> 02:53:28.140]   in a long distant past,
[02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:30.880]   but the thread runs through your work today.
[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:33.380]   Who to you is the most fascinating serial killer
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:39.440]   of the true crime things that you've explored?
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:42.840]   - I think, well, Ted Bundy's way up there.
[02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:45.340]   I think Charles Manson is another.
[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:51.120]   - Have you seen on Ted Bundy,
[02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:53.320]   'cause I find him super fascinating.
[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:56.160]   Have you seen, there's a lot of movies on him,
[02:53:56.160 --> 02:53:59.820]   extremely wicked, shockingly even vile.
[02:53:59.820 --> 02:54:02.060]   It's a retelling of his life
[02:54:02.060 --> 02:54:04.780]   from the perspective of his long-term girlfriend.
[02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:05.940]   - No, I have not seen that one yet.
[02:54:05.940 --> 02:54:08.860]   - Which ties together a lot of our conversation.
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:10.900]   So it's probably my favorite one.
[02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:13.540]   A lot of people say it's the best movie on Ted Bundy.
[02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:14.540]   So you should definitely watch it.
[02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:15.480]   - I will.
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:16.580]   - I recommend it to others,
[02:54:16.580 --> 02:54:21.500]   but it's from a perspective of the relationship.
[02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:26.500]   And it just, one of the really powerful windows
[02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:30.640]   into a serial killer that I saw there
[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:32.560]   is that from the perspective of the relationship,
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:35.000]   you can have just this healthy looking relationship.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.920]   Yeah, there's some fights and so on,
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:39.520]   but the usual dating and all that kind of stuff
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:40.600]   was all there.
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:42.120]   So all the murders he was doing,
[02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:45.680]   he had a long-term girlfriend throughout all of that.
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:47.920]   And also throughout all of that,
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.320]   I'll try not to give away,
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:50.920]   in case you don't know the story,
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:53.440]   throughout all of that, she stood by his side.
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:56.640]   She refused to believe everything that was happening
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:00.980]   until the very end.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:02.500]   Of course, it shifts in the very end,
[02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:04.400]   and that's a fascinating shift,
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.240]   the breaking of the illusion.
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:09.160]   But it's really fascinating
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:11.340]   that you can have those two things.
[02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:15.560]   - Yeah, well, I think that part of it is
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:20.200]   we have these stereotypes that we expect
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:22.960]   people like serial killers to be these
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:27.960]   ugly, drooling creatures that are sort of evil all the time.
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:33.320]   And so, that's why even like you had,
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:36.360]   I don't know if I'm remembering this correctly,
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:40.600]   but like Stalin, who killed millions of people,
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:44.440]   apparently loved his kids and loved his family.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:47.840]   So we have, as part of the complication,
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:51.520]   the complexity of human nature and human psychology
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:53.860]   is we don't have just this one,
[02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:59.400]   this one property that dictates
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:01.720]   how we behave in all circumstances.
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:07.480]   - Yeah, the devil is going to be charismatic.
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:12.600]   That's why, that's one of the things I've learned
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:14.280]   about just looking at evil people,
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:16.280]   looking at Jeffrey Epstein,
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:18.840]   who seemed to have hoodwinked quite a lot of people.
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:21.920]   - Yes, yeah, that's another fascinating case.
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:24.040]   Yeah, not that he wasn't a serial killer,
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:26.140]   but a serial sexual predator.
[02:56:26.140 --> 02:56:32.000]   - And a lot of people I know and respect
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.680]   didn't see the evil.
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:36.740]   - Yeah.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:39.480]   - And so I never met the guy,
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:42.440]   but it's like, are you guys oblivious?
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:44.600]   Like, there must have been something,
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.800]   from everything I see is purely just charisma.
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.120]   It's the smoke and mirrors that--
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:54.400]   - Yeah, well, he was a very charming psychopath.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:57.520]   - Yeah, but I think every psychopath
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.220]   to be effective has to be charming.
[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:01.760]   - Yeah, the successful ones, yeah.
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:03.660]   Yeah, successful psychopaths.
[02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:06.720]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:08.920]   - And that was, I mean, Ted Bundy was one.
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:12.520]   He was a good-looking guy, intelligent,
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.940]   and could turn on the charm, and then had this evil.
[02:57:16.940 --> 02:57:19.800]   - Is there something interesting to be said
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:22.720]   that I think a large percentage of the fan base,
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:25.840]   like I've seen numbers like 80% plus of the fan base
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:28.320]   for true crime shows is women?
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.000]   Is there some psychology behind that?
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:32.040]   - I haven't seen that.
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:36.060]   I'm not aware of a sex difference that I'm not aware of.
[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:39.640]   - I mean, I've heard that in a lot of places.
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:44.640]   I wonder if there's something about true crime,
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:49.480]   maybe because it's just like sexual kinks
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:52.720]   for men develop early on, the cues.
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:56.540]   Maybe for women, there's the cues of the threat of violence.
[02:57:56.540 --> 02:58:00.680]   The attentiveness to violence develops early on,
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:03.120]   and therefore, fascination with violence.
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:06.860]   - Well, I think that, I mean, one thing is that,
[02:58:06.860 --> 02:58:08.680]   well, with serial killers specifically,
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:11.160]   I don't know if this is true of true crime in general,
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:16.160]   but serial killers, you find a lot of people,
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:19.360]   well, a lot of women fall in love with them,
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:23.240]   or even if they're jailed for serial killing.
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:26.040]   And I think one of the features of it
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:31.040]   is that it parasitizes or hijacks status mechanisms
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:37.600]   in that a key cue to status is the attention structure.
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:40.500]   That is, the high-status people are the people
[02:58:40.500 --> 02:58:43.120]   to whom the most people pay the most attention.
[02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:46.560]   And so serial killers garner a lot of attention,
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:51.560]   and even though for evil deeds, it's still attention.
[02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:56.200]   So I think that that hijacking
[02:58:56.200 --> 02:58:59.880]   of our status allocation adaptations
[02:58:59.880 --> 02:59:02.640]   is partly responsible for that.
[02:59:02.640 --> 02:59:05.600]   - Is there, given the trajectory of your life,
[02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:09.160]   you mentioned Berkeley and the East Coast and Michigan,
[02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:10.360]   you got everything.
[02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:12.800]   Is there, given the trajectory of your life,
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:16.880]   in geography and in science,
[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:19.600]   can you give advice to young folks today,
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:20.720]   high school, college,
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:23.760]   thinking about how to make their own trajectory,
[02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:25.360]   how to make their own way through life
[02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:26.840]   that they can be proud of,
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:31.840]   either career or just love life or life?
[02:59:32.480 --> 02:59:36.480]   - Yeah, well, not necessarily on careers,
[02:59:36.480 --> 02:59:40.200]   but I can give advice on mating.
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:42.000]   And I think it's one of these things
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:47.000]   where we have requirements for the courses
[02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:51.800]   that students have to take in high school, for example.
[02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:53.520]   And I think there should be a required course
[02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:57.000]   on relationships, on mating.
[02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.300]   - So not just sex?
[02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:01.880]   - Yeah, not just sex at all, yeah.
[03:00:01.880 --> 03:00:03.320]   'Cause I mean, most of what's taught
[03:00:03.320 --> 03:00:05.240]   is they teach about sexual health
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:08.280]   and how not to get an STI and so forth.
[03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:11.760]   - Yeah, my teacher put a condom on a banana.
[03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:12.600]   - Right, right.
[03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:13.760]   - It was very exciting.
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:16.880]   - But how to select a mate?
[03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:20.160]   How do you know if you're in a bad mating relationship?
[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:25.160]   How to get out of a bad mating relationship?
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:30.160]   I think that there's, at this point in the science,
[03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:31.920]   even though there's a lot that we don't know,
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:35.440]   we know enough to at least provide some heuristics
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:39.200]   or general guidelines to things to watch out for.
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:42.160]   So just as a concrete example,
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:44.040]   with intimate partner violence,
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:47.160]   and this is male to female,
[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:50.380]   there are statistical predictors of,
[03:00:50.380 --> 03:00:53.280]   is this guy, does he have an increased probability
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:55.040]   of beating you up?
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:57.720]   And there are things like if he starts to insist
[03:00:57.720 --> 03:00:59.880]   on knowing where you are at all times,
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:02.280]   if he starts cutting off your relationships
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:04.200]   with your friends and your family.
[03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:08.800]   So there are these kind of early warning signs,
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:11.840]   and I think women should know about those.
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:16.840]   Or even things like that women are most in danger
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:20.940]   of being killed by an ex during the first three
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:23.380]   to six months after they've broken up with him.
[03:01:23.380 --> 03:01:26.160]   That sometimes they think it's,
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:29.400]   the guy will say, "Meet with me one last time,
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:31.200]   and then I won't bother you again."
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.640]   No, this is a dangerous time.
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:37.200]   So I think there's some knowledge that we do know
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:39.720]   that can be used to make informed decisions
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:42.600]   about our mating lives, and I think that should be taught.
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:47.080]   - So consider that, like take the mating strategies,
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:49.600]   the mating life seriously.
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:51.080]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:56.080]   And because, aside from a small number of people
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:59.760]   who are totally uninterested in any kind of mating
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:02.800]   or sexuality, and there are a small percentage
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:04.240]   that fall into that category,
[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:07.720]   we all confront problems of mating.
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:10.000]   - How do you, you know there's that,
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.800]   called the mathematical model,
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:14.240]   like secretary problem, marriage problem.
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:16.200]   I don't know if you're familiar, but basically,
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:19.580]   you have, it's a silly, perhaps not,
[03:02:19.580 --> 03:02:23.680]   it's a formalized, simplified,
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:28.560]   queuing theory type of thing, where you have N subjects,
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:33.560]   and you get to date some number of people,
[03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:36.200]   and then there's a stopping condition,
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:38.640]   I believe it's N over E,
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:42.000]   beyond which you pick the next partner,
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.560]   which is better than anybody you've dated before.
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:49.000]   So let's not overemphasize that idea,
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.600]   but if I were to psychologize it,
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:56.760]   I would say that some exploration is good,
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:00.200]   some dating is good, but at a certain point,
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:04.480]   you pick somebody, given the set of people you've explored,
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:09.480]   you pick somebody who is pretty desirable
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:11.880]   within that group.
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:15.360]   - Yeah, yeah, but I would add that what you also wanna do
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:19.560]   is you want to mate with someone
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:21.960]   who's equivalent in mate value,
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:25.480]   or has even what's more difficult is,
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:30.480]   has a likely equivalent future mate value trajectory,
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:34.200]   because nothing remains static.
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:36.760]   - Yes, that's beautiful.
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:39.920]   - But it's also the case that there are individual things,
[03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:40.920]   we haven't talked about these,
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:44.800]   but things like religious orientation,
[03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:48.360]   political orientation, values,
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:51.520]   these are extremely important to be compatible on.
[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:54.560]   And so you do have cases of, let's say,
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:57.680]   a Democrat marrying a Republican,
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:01.240]   and that sometimes works,
[03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:03.720]   but you're gonna get into a lot of conflict,
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:05.320]   other things being equal,
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:08.040]   or someone who's deeply religious
[03:04:08.040 --> 03:04:10.480]   versus someone who is not at all religious,
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:11.800]   that's gonna be a problem,
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:14.200]   or someone who's of a different religious faith.
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:18.800]   And so compatibility on those things,
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:21.600]   compatibility also on personality dimensions,
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:22.920]   I think there's some main effects,
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:26.360]   so I would recommend avoiding that dimension
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:29.080]   we talked about of emotional instability,
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:31.400]   'cause if you sign up for that,
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:33.840]   you at least should know you're gonna be in for
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:36.000]   a lot of conflict.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:37.560]   It may be exciting at times,
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:39.560]   but there's gonna be a lot of ups and downs.
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:40.920]   - Know what you sign up for.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:43.320]   What about how much to date?
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:45.120]   So there's a culture,
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:48.640]   I'm speaking soon to a founder
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:52.280]   and long-time ex-CEO of Tinder,
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:56.840]   so there's that culture of digitalized dating,
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:58.920]   of swipe right, swipe left.
[03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:01.800]   Is it positive, negative?
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:03.840]   How much should you date?
[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:04.760]   What's the number?
[03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:08.480]   And also, what number of sexual partners should you,
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:10.680]   what's optimal, asking for a friend?
[03:05:10.680 --> 03:05:13.720]   - I don't know if there's a single optimum there.
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:15.600]   - I was hoping there was.
[03:05:15.600 --> 03:05:16.440]   - I think that--
[03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:20.320]   - Is it single digits or double digits?
[03:05:20.320 --> 03:05:21.440]   I need answers.
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:22.320]   - Well, I don't know.
[03:05:22.320 --> 03:05:25.880]   I get some of my wisdom from lyrics, from songs.
[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:26.720]   - Me too.
[03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:28.200]   Bruce Springsteen.
[03:05:28.200 --> 03:05:32.560]   - This Eagles song, I think Don Henley said something like,
[03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:35.120]   there are too many lovers in one lifetime,
[03:05:35.120 --> 03:05:38.280]   ain't good for you, or something like that.
[03:05:38.280 --> 03:05:42.440]   But I think there is--
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:44.040]   - Take it easy is a good one too.
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:44.880]   - Yeah.
[03:05:45.840 --> 03:05:48.680]   Basically, don't get too attached.
[03:05:48.680 --> 03:05:51.400]   Don't take heartbreak too seriously.
[03:05:51.400 --> 03:05:52.240]   - Yeah.
[03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:55.120]   So, but I think, I mean, internet dating,
[03:05:55.120 --> 03:05:57.720]   and there's been some work on them,
[03:05:57.720 --> 03:06:00.480]   I think has its pluses and minuses.
[03:06:00.480 --> 03:06:03.320]   And one of the pluses is it gives you access
[03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:04.880]   to potential pools of mates
[03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:08.520]   that you could never possibly meet in real life,
[03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:12.120]   where mating and dating used to be either people you knew,
[03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:16.960]   or friends of friends, or you go out to bars, or parties.
[03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:18.840]   But so that's the good thing,
[03:06:18.840 --> 03:06:22.480]   gives you access to those extended pools.
[03:06:22.480 --> 03:06:26.120]   But also it gives people the illusion
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:28.640]   that there's always someone better out there for you.
[03:06:28.640 --> 03:06:30.440]   Someone who's just a little more attractive,
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:32.280]   a little more compatible, a little more.
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:35.400]   And so it produces what's sometimes
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:37.560]   called decision paralysis.
[03:06:37.560 --> 03:06:41.200]   You have too many options and you can't choose.
[03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:45.400]   I think one other potential negative,
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:46.800]   which I think could be corrected
[03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:48.720]   by these internet dating sites,
[03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:53.720]   is that the picture, the photographs of the face and body
[03:06:53.720 --> 03:06:59.360]   tend to overwhelm all other sources of information.
[03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:02.120]   And so, especially if you're just looking for a sex partner,
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:02.960]   that's one thing.
[03:07:02.960 --> 03:07:05.880]   Physical appearances, it's fine for that
[03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:07.600]   to be overwhelmingly important.
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:09.200]   But if you're looking for a long-term mate,
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:10.360]   there's so many other things
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:13.080]   that are really, really important.
[03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:17.680]   And so, but people tend to be swamped
[03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:21.200]   by the visual input, which is natural
[03:07:21.200 --> 03:07:24.160]   because that's where we evolved to respond to visual input.
[03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:27.000]   We're not evolved to respond to words,
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:32.640]   like, "Oh, I like to go fishing," or something like that.
[03:07:32.640 --> 03:07:37.160]   So if there's some way for these sites to,
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:40.640]   in long-term mating, for these other characteristics
[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:44.800]   to be made more salient in people's information processing,
[03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:47.520]   I think that would be a valuable improvement.
[03:07:47.520 --> 03:07:50.320]   - Yeah, because even, forget long-term beauty,
[03:07:50.320 --> 03:07:54.380]   even sex appeal is,
[03:07:54.380 --> 03:07:57.600]   like, even the word appearance,
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:00.520]   it feels like, to me, people that are super sexy
[03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:04.120]   in real life are a lot more than their picture.
[03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:04.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:07.520]   Like, it's actually surprising.
[03:08:07.520 --> 03:08:09.360]   Like, they come to life in different ways.
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:10.200]   - Yes.
[03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:12.160]   - It could be either submissiveness as shyness
[03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:17.160]   or extravagant wit and humor,
[03:08:17.160 --> 03:08:20.400]   or like super confident or super,
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:22.040]   like, whatever they are,
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:24.920]   whatever the weirdness that they are comes through.
[03:08:24.920 --> 03:08:27.120]   So when people say, well,
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:28.600]   that was just the case of the,
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:31.600]   sort of proponents of dating apps,
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:34.040]   it's like, well, when you meet somebody at a bar,
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:35.760]   you're getting the same experience as you do
[03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:38.680]   on a dating site, you have very little information,
[03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:40.680]   all you get is appearance.
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:43.480]   But I don't think appearance on the screen
[03:08:43.480 --> 03:08:45.440]   is the same as appearance in real life,
[03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:47.400]   especially with people that, for some reason,
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:48.920]   you find super sexy.
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:51.480]   'Cause, like, and again, the objectification
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:53.220]   that we mentioned earlier is the,
[03:08:53.220 --> 03:08:56.760]   it over-optimizes for people
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:59.120]   who are good at taking pictures of themselves.
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:02.020]   Like, they're representing themselves inaccurately.
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:06.060]   They're not just even in the physical features,
[03:09:06.060 --> 03:09:07.680]   but in the way those physical features
[03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:10.000]   are used in physical reality.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:11.540]   Like, in terms of body language,
[03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:13.200]   in terms of flirtation,
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:16.320]   in terms of just everything put together.
[03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:21.320]   So I just, I wonder if there's a way to close that gap.
[03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:24.420]   And I don't know what that is exactly.
[03:09:24.420 --> 03:09:27.400]   I tend to believe more information is good on dating.
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:28.760]   I don't use, actually, dating apps.
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:31.680]   I just, 'cause they don't make any sense to me,
[03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:33.680]   'cause there's not enough information.
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:37.600]   Like, what this, like, to me,
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:41.800]   like, whether you know Dostoevsky or not is important.
[03:09:41.800 --> 03:09:43.280]   And I don't mean that because you've read,
[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:45.640]   specifically, a book by Dostoevsky,
[03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:49.160]   but there's something about, have you suffered?
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:51.200]   Have you thought about life deeply?
[03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:53.680]   Have you been shaken in some way?
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:56.560]   And that's not, sometimes books can reveal that.
[03:09:56.560 --> 03:09:58.000]   Sometimes something else can reveal that.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.960]   But this kinda very shallow resume,
[03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:05.320]   like, I like to travel, I have boobs.
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:07.320]   It's like this kinda thing is,
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:09.880]   it loses the humanity of it all.
[03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:11.800]   Because, listen, as a fan of technology,
[03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:15.200]   I would love dating to open up, like you said,
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:18.560]   the pool of possibilities out there, the soulmate idea.
[03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:21.600]   Like, I believe that there's an incredible people
[03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:24.560]   out there for you that is an emotional connection,
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:26.280]   not just a physical connection.
[03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:28.260]   And so that the promise of,
[03:10:30.920 --> 03:10:34.120]   digital tech is that you can discover those people.
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:36.000]   And that's not just for a romantic relationship,
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.160]   it's for friendships, it's for business partners,
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:41.600]   it's for all that kinda stuff, like your friend groups.
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:42.920]   But yeah, there's something,
[03:10:42.920 --> 03:10:44.760]   seems broken about dating sites.
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:47.040]   - Yeah, well, that's why, I mean,
[03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:49.720]   when I'm asked for advice on this,
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:53.560]   I say, if you feel like you have a connection with someone,
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:56.840]   meet them in person, meet them in real life.
[03:10:56.840 --> 03:10:58.360]   - And take the road trip, like you said.
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:00.320]   - Yeah, take the road trip. - Stress test it.
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:03.520]   - Yes, yeah, 'cause there's only, I mean,
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:08.520]   so much you can learn through messaging and so forth.
[03:11:08.520 --> 03:11:12.880]   - Amongst all of this, we didn't really,
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:17.240]   we didn't really mention love, which is hilarious.
[03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:21.520]   So let me ask you, in the last just few questions,
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:23.360]   what's the role of love in all of this
[03:11:23.360 --> 03:11:25.840]   in the human condition?
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:29.880]   So if we talked about mating,
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:32.000]   we talked about mate selection,
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.760]   we talked about all the things we find attractive in a mate,
[03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:37.120]   the status hierarchies and all that kinda stuff,
[03:11:37.120 --> 03:11:39.440]   what about that deep connection with a human being
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:41.440]   that's hard to explain?
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:42.960]   - Well, we talked about it a little bit,
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:46.820]   but so we're talking about love, like romantic love.
[03:11:46.820 --> 03:11:51.600]   I think it's an evolved emotion
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:56.600]   that evolved in part to solidify long-term pair bonds.
[03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:02.320]   And is it different from the love of a parent for a child
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:07.280]   or brotherly love or sisterly love or other friendship love?
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:10.000]   I think these are different phenomena.
[03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.400]   But if we're talking about romantic love,
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:14.220]   I think it's an evolved emotion.
[03:12:14.220 --> 03:12:19.480]   Leading hypothesis is that it's a commitment device.
[03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:23.340]   So if I say to a potential mate,
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:27.640]   oh, you exceed my minimum thresholds
[03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:30.560]   on intelligence and looks,
[03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:32.520]   I think we make a good couple.
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:33.720]   - That's a good pickup line.
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:37.880]   - Yeah, it wouldn't do much emotionally.
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:41.200]   But if you say, I love you,
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:44.160]   it's I can't stop thinking about you,
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:48.200]   it's this uncontrollable emotion that I feel toward you,
[03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:53.200]   it's a sign that I'm committed to you,
[03:12:53.260 --> 03:12:55.340]   at least for a while,
[03:12:55.340 --> 03:12:57.300]   and I'm not gonna abandon you when,
[03:12:57.300 --> 03:13:01.280]   if you're an eight, and when an 8.5 comes along,
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:03.880]   I'm not gonna drop you and go with the 8.5.
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:06.500]   - Yeah, that's so interesting,
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:11.500]   but it's still the reality of the emotion is there,
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:14.360]   however it evolved, it's still there.
[03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:15.200]   And it's interesting.
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:18.340]   It's one of the more puzzling pieces here.
[03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:21.160]   Even broader than romantic love,
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:24.440]   but in romantic love, what is that?
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:27.240]   How much of that is nature, how much of it is nurture?
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:32.240]   'Cause even, I mean, I ask that myself all the time,
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:36.360]   like I'm deeply romantic, how much of that is nature?
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:38.160]   How much of it is nurture?
[03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:42.960]   How much is the people I spent my childhood with,
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:47.640]   the ideas, I mean, the Soviet Union
[03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:49.280]   sort of is known for the literature
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:53.480]   and the movies and so on that are very over,
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:55.000]   that are heavily romanticized.
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.200]   I don't wanna say over-romanticized.
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:13:59.560]   Maybe there's no such thing, but so maybe, what is that?
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:02.560]   Is that my upbringing, or is that somewhere in the genetics
[03:14:02.560 --> 03:14:06.080]   that I value that emotional connection a lot?
[03:14:06.080 --> 03:14:11.080]   - Yeah, well, most humans have the capacity for love.
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:20.320]   Whether it is activated in any individual person
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:24.680]   such as you or anyone else,
[03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:28.640]   it is gonna be adjusted or suppressed
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:32.520]   by different social and cultural and upbringing factors.
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:36.320]   I mean, there are cultures where parents
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:39.440]   basically lock away girls, they cloister them,
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:41.960]   and so they can't ever meet anyone else
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:44.000]   until the parents arrange to marry them.
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:48.160]   So they override any possibility of love.
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:54.640]   But I think it's an evolved emotion.
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:59.640]   And I mean, one kind of test of this,
[03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:04.400]   and this is just slightly circumstantial evidence,
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:08.400]   but in China historically, there have been arranged marriages
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:12.960]   and then individual choice marriages.
[03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:15.800]   The arranged marriages tend to have higher breakup rates
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:19.360]   and lower child production
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:22.800]   than the ones that are sort of voluntarily chosen.
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:23.640]   You know, so-called above-max.
[03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:26.220]   - I've heard sort of contrasting stuff from India.
[03:15:26.220 --> 03:15:31.720]   I wonder, contrasting, so where the arranged marriages
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:33.040]   are longer-lasting.
[03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:36.400]   It's so interesting, 'cause you said China.
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:37.240]   - Yeah.
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:39.100]   - I would love to see the data and the dance of that,
[03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:41.560]   because maybe there's a lot of other interesting factors,
[03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:43.560]   like how the arranged marriage is arranged.
[03:15:43.560 --> 03:15:45.120]   - Yes.
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:49.040]   - Is it for the families, is the interest of the families
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:51.680]   for some kind of like in the monarchies
[03:15:51.680 --> 03:15:53.760]   to make agreements to trade resources,
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:55.480]   or is the interest of the family
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:57.920]   to maximize the success of the marriage?
[03:15:57.920 --> 03:15:59.720]   So compatibility, is it,
[03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:01.840]   are they looking for maximized compatibility,
[03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:04.200]   or are they looking to maximize resources?
[03:16:04.200 --> 03:16:08.860]   - Well, historically, it's often been an arrangement
[03:16:08.860 --> 03:16:12.560]   where they're trying to maximize the status and power
[03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:16.640]   of the alliance with this other extended family.
[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:21.160]   But that also varies from culture to culture.
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:23.880]   Like there's the Tiwi culture,
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:25.880]   where there's, you know,
[03:16:25.880 --> 03:16:30.840]   the men basically bestow their daughters on other men,
[03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:33.980]   and they try to gauge which men,
[03:16:33.980 --> 03:16:36.440]   which of these young up-and-coming men
[03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:40.060]   are really gonna be, you know, chiefs, high-status guys,
[03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:41.620]   and which ones are gonna be losers.
[03:16:41.620 --> 03:16:45.700]   And so you have this weird phenomenon,
[03:16:45.700 --> 03:16:47.860]   they have a peligrous marriage,
[03:16:47.860 --> 03:16:52.640]   where a guy will get one daughter bestowed on him,
[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:55.060]   and then other men use that as information
[03:16:55.060 --> 03:16:58.020]   that this guy must be rising in status,
[03:16:58.020 --> 03:17:00.020]   and so they give their daughters to the guy as well.
[03:17:00.020 --> 03:17:02.980]   And so the guy might go from like zero to seven wives
[03:17:02.980 --> 03:17:03.820]   in a very short span of time.
[03:17:03.820 --> 03:17:05.300]   - Yeah, the rich get richer.
[03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:07.060]   That's fascinating.
[03:17:07.060 --> 03:17:11.860]   The Game of Thrones, and sex is a part of that game.
[03:17:11.860 --> 03:17:17.680]   Let me ask you about yourself, your own self.
[03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:22.080]   We mentioned Richard Wrangham, think about mortality.
[03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:24.940]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[03:17:24.940 --> 03:17:27.560]   Are you afraid of death?
[03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:29.960]   - Yeah, interesting.
[03:17:29.960 --> 03:17:31.920]   I'm not afraid of death.
[03:17:31.920 --> 03:17:34.340]   I agree with Richard Wrangham.
[03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:36.460]   I'm not eager to leave the party.
[03:17:36.460 --> 03:17:38.380]   I don't wanna leave the party soon.
[03:17:38.380 --> 03:17:42.540]   I enjoy life in all of its interesting complexities.
[03:17:42.540 --> 03:17:45.420]   I enjoy my scientific work.
[03:17:45.420 --> 03:17:48.140]   I enjoy my relationships with other people.
[03:17:48.140 --> 03:17:49.780]   I enjoy exploring the universe.
[03:17:49.780 --> 03:17:53.980]   So I'm not eager to leave, but I'm not afraid of it.
[03:17:53.980 --> 03:17:58.980]   And I think part of that is that I was married for a while
[03:18:01.140 --> 03:18:06.140]   and my wife died prematurely of cancer.
[03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:10.500]   And so I spent basically eight months with her
[03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:13.200]   watching her die after she was diagnosed.
[03:18:13.200 --> 03:18:17.180]   And there's some, it was a horrible time for me
[03:18:17.180 --> 03:18:19.880]   and for her, obviously, but there's some way
[03:18:19.880 --> 03:18:24.880]   in which it kind of made it more familiar
[03:18:24.880 --> 03:18:28.560]   so that it became a lot less frightening.
[03:18:30.940 --> 03:18:31.780]   But--
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:36.380]   - How did that experience change you?
[03:18:36.380 --> 03:18:39.660]   Just as a scientist, as a thinker about humanity,
[03:18:39.660 --> 03:18:44.420]   as a human yourself?
[03:18:44.420 --> 03:18:45.740]   - Well, I--
[03:18:45.740 --> 03:18:47.240]   - So you're saying you felt,
[03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:50.100]   like you felt a little bit more ready
[03:18:50.100 --> 03:18:52.720]   for this whole end of the party.
[03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:57.120]   - Well, yeah, it's, I mean, 'cause we tend to be afraid
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:00.340]   of things that we're not familiar with, you know?
[03:19:00.340 --> 03:19:02.480]   And so if you're familiar with it,
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:07.620]   at least in my case, that caused a lessening
[03:19:07.620 --> 03:19:10.340]   of fear on that dimension.
[03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:13.340]   But I don't know, it also kind of, you know,
[03:19:13.340 --> 03:19:17.300]   there are these existential thoughts that it brought about,
[03:19:17.300 --> 03:19:20.620]   like how ephemeral life is.
[03:19:20.620 --> 03:19:24.180]   And I remember this Richard Dawkins quote,
[03:19:24.180 --> 03:19:28.060]   he said something like, "We are all gonna die
[03:19:28.060 --> 03:19:30.020]   "and we're the lucky ones."
[03:19:30.020 --> 03:19:31.860]   (laughing)
[03:19:31.860 --> 03:19:34.980]   - Yeah, that we even got a chance.
[03:19:34.980 --> 03:19:38.940]   - Yeah, or even, you mentioned Russian writers.
[03:19:38.940 --> 03:19:42.460]   One of my favorite writers is Nabokov, Vladimir Nabokov.
[03:19:42.460 --> 03:19:44.100]   I don't know if you've read him,
[03:19:44.100 --> 03:19:49.100]   but he said once that life is a chink of light
[03:19:49.100 --> 03:19:52.540]   between two eternities of darkness.
[03:19:52.540 --> 03:19:57.200]   - And you're saying that's not terrifying to you?
[03:19:57.200 --> 03:20:00.300]   - Well, I prefer, I'm happy with the prior,
[03:20:00.300 --> 03:20:01.980]   the first eternity of darkness,
[03:20:01.980 --> 03:20:04.980]   I prefer the second not to occur,
[03:20:04.980 --> 03:20:07.140]   but it's going to occur.
[03:20:07.140 --> 03:20:11.900]   I mean, we know that Elon Musk aside,
[03:20:11.900 --> 03:20:16.900]   I'm skeptical that we'll be colonizing other planets
[03:20:16.900 --> 03:20:19.420]   in any substantive way.
[03:20:19.420 --> 03:20:25.140]   And so our star, our sun will burn out.
[03:20:25.140 --> 03:20:28.620]   And so it's gonna take a few billion years or so,
[03:20:28.620 --> 03:20:33.000]   but it will eventually, the Earth will become a cold lump
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:38.000]   of dirt floating around in the universe with no life on it.
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:40.380]   - So it's not just your light,
[03:20:40.380 --> 03:20:42.520]   the light of your consciousness,
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:45.740]   it's the light of our human civilization
[03:20:45.740 --> 03:20:46.840]   that will eventually go out.
[03:20:46.840 --> 03:20:48.040]   - Yes, everything.
[03:20:48.040 --> 03:20:51.200]   At least here.
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:54.600]   I do believe that there is life and intelligent life
[03:20:54.600 --> 03:20:59.600]   in other parts of the universe on other planets.
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:04.740]   - I sometimes wonder if the second eternal darkness
[03:21:04.740 --> 03:21:08.780]   is the thing that makes the light possible.
[03:21:08.780 --> 03:21:11.260]   So in the other places out there,
[03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:15.300]   I wonder how successfully can you truly be
[03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:17.260]   without the deadline of death,
[03:21:17.260 --> 03:21:22.060]   both at the human scale and at the civilizational scale.
[03:21:22.060 --> 03:21:25.540]   I feel like in order to create anything beautiful,
[03:21:25.540 --> 03:21:27.840]   we'll have to live on the edge of destruction.
[03:21:27.840 --> 03:21:32.000]   That seems to be, some people would say
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.140]   that's just a feature of our past,
[03:21:34.140 --> 03:21:35.540]   that our future can be otherwise.
[03:21:35.540 --> 03:21:40.080]   But like you, I'm somebody that looks at the data.
[03:21:40.080 --> 03:21:43.180]   And currently the data says otherwise,
[03:21:43.180 --> 03:21:46.180]   but of course we're constantly changing the data
[03:21:46.180 --> 03:21:48.480]   because there's change.
[03:21:48.480 --> 03:21:50.180]   So we'll see.
[03:21:50.180 --> 03:21:52.860]   I wonder what the future holds for us.
[03:21:52.860 --> 03:21:57.860]   Speaking of which, as somebody who wrote a textbook
[03:21:57.860 --> 03:22:00.880]   on evolutionary psychology,
[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:05.300]   what do you think is the meaning of the whole thing?
[03:22:05.300 --> 03:22:06.940]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:22:06.940 --> 03:22:10.060]   You're very good at describing
[03:22:10.060 --> 03:22:12.980]   how the human mind is the way it is,
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:15.320]   but why is it here at all?
[03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:16.440]   What's the purpose?
[03:22:16.440 --> 03:22:18.500]   - Well, I can give you my answer to that,
[03:22:18.500 --> 03:22:20.520]   but I would actually love to hear your answer
[03:22:20.520 --> 03:22:22.540]   because I know you've asked this question
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:25.900]   of dozens and dozens of people on your podcast.
[03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:28.940]   And what are your thoughts on that?
[03:22:28.940 --> 03:22:32.260]   - Well, first of all, my mind changes on that a lot.
[03:22:32.260 --> 03:22:34.740]   And I think the process of answering the question
[03:22:34.740 --> 03:22:38.060]   is the fun thing, not the actual final answer.
[03:22:38.060 --> 03:22:40.420]   I think the question itself is the most fun thing.
[03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:45.420]   But for me, usually is two things.
[03:22:45.820 --> 03:22:49.500]   One is love, and we can talk a long time.
[03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:52.520]   What I mean by that is it's not just romantic love.
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:57.520]   And two is to create and hopefully to create beauty.
[03:22:57.520 --> 03:23:00.820]   So, and again, I can talk forever what that means.
[03:23:00.820 --> 03:23:05.820]   For me personally, creating beauty means engineering
[03:23:05.820 --> 03:23:09.820]   and creating experiences, like connection with others.
[03:23:09.820 --> 03:23:14.820]   On the love side, it's just the actual feeling,
[03:23:15.380 --> 03:23:20.140]   the experience of deep appreciation
[03:23:20.140 --> 03:23:24.460]   of everything around you,
[03:23:24.460 --> 03:23:27.400]   like the sensory experiences of everything around you.
[03:23:27.400 --> 03:23:31.080]   Just feeling it every single moment,
[03:23:31.080 --> 03:23:35.960]   saying I'm damn glad to be alive.
[03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:38.920]   That light with the darkness on each side,
[03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:40.020]   just being appreciative,
[03:23:40.020 --> 03:23:45.120]   like being in the experience of truly
[03:23:45.760 --> 03:23:48.760]   present and experiencing it.
[03:23:48.760 --> 03:23:52.200]   'Cause it's not going to be there for long,
[03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:53.400]   the whole thing ends.
[03:23:53.400 --> 03:23:54.640]   And that to me is love.
[03:23:54.640 --> 03:23:57.760]   And the reason romantic love is so important
[03:23:57.760 --> 03:24:01.680]   is that other people are just awesome.
[03:24:01.680 --> 03:24:05.240]   They're fascinating black boxes
[03:24:05.240 --> 03:24:07.920]   that can generate awesomeness.
[03:24:07.920 --> 03:24:11.620]   So can like other animals and objects for me,
[03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:14.880]   but humans in particular for some reason,
[03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:17.480]   are just generated of awesomeness.
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:18.520]   They surprise us.
[03:24:18.520 --> 03:24:22.640]   And therefore a good target of love.
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:26.680]   - Well, so that's a much more eloquent answer
[03:24:26.680 --> 03:24:28.480]   than I could give,
[03:24:28.480 --> 03:24:32.040]   but I'll just say a thought or two on that.
[03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:34.780]   And I mean, one of the things,
[03:24:34.780 --> 03:24:39.040]   what is the meaning of life?
[03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:40.360]   I mean, in some sense,
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:46.240]   if you're thinking about some eternal purpose,
[03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:51.000]   meaning like if we look 5 billion years hence,
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:52.640]   will any of this mean anything?
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:56.120]   I think the answer to that is probably no.
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:24:59.440]   Okay, but, and this is I think where my answer
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:04.200]   would concur with yours is that I think we have a rich,
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:09.200]   evolved psychology that contains many complex adaptations.
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:16.200]   And at any one moment in time, most are quiescent,
[03:25:16.200 --> 03:25:18.280]   most are not activated.
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:22.080]   But for me, part of the meaning of life
[03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:26.100]   is experiencing the activation
[03:25:26.100 --> 03:25:29.340]   of a lot of these complicated,
[03:25:29.340 --> 03:25:31.200]   evolved psychological mechanisms.
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:35.000]   And they include romantic love, they include friendship,
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:38.680]   they include being part of a group or coalition,
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:41.880]   'cause I think we're an intensely coalitional species.
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:45.560]   So there's something about being a group member.
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:49.280]   So just even, I don't know, if you're in sports,
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:52.240]   if your team wins, you feel that somehow
[03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:53.880]   that's your part of that.
[03:25:53.880 --> 03:25:59.240]   But this goes for both the positive
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:02.360]   and the darker sides of things.
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:05.720]   So for example, warfare,
[03:26:06.740 --> 03:26:10.900]   you see these men who have been through a war together
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:14.280]   and where their lives have depended on each other,
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:17.000]   and they're like best friends for life
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.780]   and have a bond that is stronger
[03:26:19.780 --> 03:26:24.300]   than most people form with a friend ever in their life,
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:28.700]   'cause they've been through these life or death experiences.
[03:26:28.700 --> 03:26:31.960]   And so I wouldn't want to,
[03:26:34.940 --> 03:26:38.180]   doesn't cause me to want to charge off and be in war,
[03:26:38.180 --> 03:26:42.180]   but there are some types of adaptations,
[03:26:42.180 --> 03:26:44.180]   even like warfare adaptations,
[03:26:44.180 --> 03:26:47.540]   where in principle, I would like to experience them.
[03:26:47.540 --> 03:26:49.980]   I would like to experience, and never will,
[03:26:49.980 --> 03:26:54.980]   but what is it like to be in a coalition
[03:26:54.980 --> 03:27:00.020]   where you are in combat with another coalition?
[03:27:00.020 --> 03:27:03.140]   Not modern warfare, 'cause it's horrible,
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:04.780]   but where your life is in danger,
[03:27:04.780 --> 03:27:09.460]   where you depend for your life on other people
[03:27:09.460 --> 03:27:11.580]   and they're depending for their life on you,
[03:27:11.580 --> 03:27:14.980]   and there's this kind of coalitional solidarity
[03:27:14.980 --> 03:27:17.900]   that is unique.
[03:27:17.900 --> 03:27:22.140]   Now, another thing that, of course,
[03:27:22.140 --> 03:27:25.100]   I'll never be able to experience is murder,
[03:27:25.100 --> 03:27:27.060]   'cause I'm never gonna murder anybody.
[03:27:27.060 --> 03:27:30.020]   - The night is young.
[03:27:30.020 --> 03:27:34.060]   - But studying homicidal ideation really gave me,
[03:27:34.060 --> 03:27:35.180]   it was an eye-opener.
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:39.660]   It was as interesting as studying sexual fantasies,
[03:27:39.660 --> 03:27:44.220]   because if you ask what triggers homicidal thoughts,
[03:27:44.220 --> 03:27:46.420]   ideation, most people have had them.
[03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:49.340]   'Cause I asked this question,
[03:27:49.340 --> 03:27:51.380]   have you ever thought about killing someone?
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:54.820]   And I get about 90 to 1% of men say yes,
[03:27:54.820 --> 03:27:57.140]   and about 84% of women say no.
[03:27:57.140 --> 03:28:00.180]   And even when I talk to people, they say,
[03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:01.420]   one-on-one, they'll say, "Oh, no,
[03:28:01.420 --> 03:28:02.740]   "I've never thought of killing someone.
[03:28:02.740 --> 03:28:04.620]   "What kind of person do you think I am?"
[03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:06.180]   And then 10 minutes later, they'll say,
[03:28:06.180 --> 03:28:08.700]   "Actually, there was this one time
[03:28:08.700 --> 03:28:12.100]   "when this guy humiliated me in public."
[03:28:12.100 --> 03:28:19.740]   But I think thoughts about killing, homicidal ideation,
[03:28:19.740 --> 03:28:21.340]   and they're very predictable
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:23.740]   from an evolutionary perspective.
[03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:27.460]   We mentioned mate poachers earlier, and infidelity,
[03:28:27.460 --> 03:28:28.460]   and there are other things,
[03:28:28.460 --> 03:28:32.220]   but things like that, being humiliated
[03:28:32.220 --> 03:28:37.220]   in public, status loss, do trigger homicidal thoughts.
[03:28:37.220 --> 03:28:40.860]   So anyway, I don't go off too much on that,
[03:28:40.860 --> 03:28:43.620]   but I guess what I'm saying in answer to your question
[03:28:43.620 --> 03:28:48.620]   is experiencing the rich array of complex psychology
[03:28:48.620 --> 03:28:57.020]   that we have within us, most of which remains unactivated,
[03:28:57.020 --> 03:29:00.400]   and some of which will never be experienced.
[03:29:01.220 --> 03:29:04.420]   Like, there's some people who never experience love,
[03:29:04.420 --> 03:29:09.420]   for example, because of cultural restrictions or whatever.
[03:29:09.420 --> 03:29:13.420]   And so, to me, that's part of the meaning of life.
[03:29:13.420 --> 03:29:15.220]   - So that's so beautifully put,
[03:29:15.220 --> 03:29:17.020]   the saying that they're kind of dormant,
[03:29:17.020 --> 03:29:22.020]   inactivated aspects of the psychological mechanism.
[03:29:22.020 --> 03:29:26.320]   So we have the capacity to experience a bunch of stuff.
[03:29:26.320 --> 03:29:27.540]   It's almost like in video games,
[03:29:27.540 --> 03:29:29.780]   you can unlock levels and so on.
[03:29:29.780 --> 03:29:31.980]   - And so this is basically,
[03:29:31.980 --> 03:29:36.980]   there's all of these things that are dormant in our mind
[03:29:36.980 --> 03:29:40.180]   that we have the capacity to experience.
[03:29:40.180 --> 03:29:43.700]   And part of the meaning is to try to experience
[03:29:43.700 --> 03:29:49.580]   as many of them, or as many new ones,
[03:29:49.580 --> 03:29:51.940]   novel for the particular society,
[03:29:51.940 --> 03:29:54.920]   or maybe the entirety of human civilization, who knows?
[03:29:54.920 --> 03:29:58.000]   Psychedelic drugs, like you said, violence.
[03:29:59.680 --> 03:30:01.320]   Experiences that might have to do
[03:30:01.320 --> 03:30:03.000]   with brain-computer interfaces.
[03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:05.660]   The interaction with all of those are experiences.
[03:30:05.660 --> 03:30:08.460]   And so the question is, what is the ceiling?
[03:30:08.460 --> 03:30:13.940]   How infinite or nearly infinite is the capacity
[03:30:13.940 --> 03:30:15.640]   of the human mind to experience all those things?
[03:30:15.640 --> 03:30:18.680]   And we'll get to discover those things.
[03:30:18.680 --> 03:30:21.100]   So I'm glad you never got a chance,
[03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:22.900]   and never will get a chance to murder,
[03:30:22.900 --> 03:30:24.900]   but I just want to put it on record that,
[03:30:24.900 --> 03:30:29.420]   that's definitely something on my bucket list.
[03:30:29.420 --> 03:30:31.580]   Why do you think I dress like this?
[03:30:31.580 --> 03:30:34.660]   Anyway, there is something appealing.
[03:30:34.660 --> 03:30:37.220]   Like one of my favorite movies is "Leon the Professional."
[03:30:37.220 --> 03:30:38.700]   - Oh, I love that movie.
[03:30:38.700 --> 03:30:39.540]   - What is that?
[03:30:39.540 --> 03:30:40.900]   Why is that so exciting?
[03:30:40.900 --> 03:30:42.800]   Listen, maybe it's the OCD thing,
[03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:47.060]   like killing other bad guys.
[03:30:47.060 --> 03:30:48.780]   - No women, no children.
[03:30:48.780 --> 03:30:50.500]   - No women, no children.
[03:30:50.500 --> 03:30:52.340]   Also loving that with-
[03:30:52.340 --> 03:30:54.260]   - Natalie Portman.
[03:30:54.260 --> 03:30:56.780]   - Natalie Portman, incredible actress.
[03:30:56.780 --> 03:30:58.940]   Also the complex, whatever that is,
[03:30:58.940 --> 03:31:00.860]   the fatherly or romantic,
[03:31:00.860 --> 03:31:02.740]   whatever that is, like Lolita type of thing.
[03:31:02.740 --> 03:31:07.300]   I don't know what, I've never like read a PhD thesis
[03:31:07.300 --> 03:31:09.580]   on that interpretation of that movie,
[03:31:09.580 --> 03:31:11.440]   but that's a fascinating one.
[03:31:11.440 --> 03:31:15.140]   Violence and love and sex,
[03:31:15.140 --> 03:31:18.140]   that's what makes life worth living.
[03:31:18.140 --> 03:31:19.500]   That's what makes it fun.
[03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.860]   David, you're an incredible person, incredible scientist.
[03:31:21.860 --> 03:31:24.580]   It's a huge honor to share a city with you,
[03:31:24.580 --> 03:31:26.420]   or I'm the visitor.
[03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:28.020]   You own this place, you run this place.
[03:31:28.020 --> 03:31:30.900]   - Well, I don't, we both live here now.
[03:31:30.900 --> 03:31:31.740]   - Yeah.
[03:31:31.740 --> 03:31:33.740]   - And it's been great talking to you.
[03:31:33.740 --> 03:31:35.460]   It's a great honor for me.
[03:31:35.460 --> 03:31:37.460]   I mentioned, I've followed your podcast
[03:31:37.460 --> 03:31:39.060]   for a long, long time now,
[03:31:39.060 --> 03:31:42.380]   and tremendously enjoy your interviews.
[03:31:42.380 --> 03:31:47.380]   And you have a very inquisitive, inviting style
[03:31:47.380 --> 03:31:51.100]   that brings out things in your guests,
[03:31:51.100 --> 03:31:52.540]   which I think is fantastic.
[03:31:52.540 --> 03:31:55.820]   Activates all those dormant psychological mechanisms.
[03:31:55.820 --> 03:31:58.580]   That's what life, that's what conversation is all about.
[03:31:58.580 --> 03:31:59.860]   Thank you for talking today.
[03:31:59.860 --> 03:32:01.440]   - Thank you.
[03:32:01.440 --> 03:32:04.140]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Buss.
[03:32:04.140 --> 03:32:05.300]   To support this podcast,
[03:32:05.300 --> 03:32:07.900]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:32:07.900 --> 03:32:11.900]   And now, let me leave you with some words from E.B. White.
[03:32:11.900 --> 03:32:15.660]   "If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy.
[03:32:15.660 --> 03:32:19.140]   If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem.
[03:32:19.140 --> 03:32:22.340]   But I rise in the morning torn
[03:32:22.340 --> 03:32:24.500]   between a desire to improve the world
[03:32:24.500 --> 03:32:26.860]   and a desire to enjoy the world.
[03:32:26.860 --> 03:32:29.540]   This makes it hard to plan the day."
[03:32:29.540 --> 03:32:33.500]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:32:33.500 --> 03:32:36.080]   (upbeat music)
[03:32:36.080 --> 03:32:38.660]   (upbeat music)
[03:32:38.660 --> 03:32:48.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
