[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:14.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.160]   My guest today is David Goggins.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.520]   David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.880]   He's also a highly accomplished ultra marathon runner. For those of you that don't know, ultra marathons are distances longer than
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.640]   26 miles, and in David's case, often longer than 200 miles. For his achievements in athletics,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.800]   he has been inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.960]   He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.240]   I should mention that not only was David a decorated Navy SEAL,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.280]   but he also graduated from Army Ranger School.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.520]   David is also a highly successful writer, having authored two books, the first entitled "Can't Hurt Me" and the second entitled "Never Finished," both of
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:06.480]   which are bestsellers. David's books cover many topics, including his autobiographical description of what can only be described as
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.800]   an incredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home was abusive, his school environment was abusive,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.600]   he essentially had no positive resources directed his way. And in his 20s,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.160]   he found himself to be obese, that is more than 300 pounds, working a job
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.380]   he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   David began an inner dialogue that forced him to explore the demons born out of his childhood,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.920]   but also the position that he found himself in as a young man, and
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.520]   then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform himself into the Navy SEAL, the ultra-marathon runner, the best-selling author, and
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.600]   the extraordinarily positive and influential man that he is today. As some of you may know,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.280]   David has done various public lectures.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.720]   He's a familiar face online, because there are so many clips of him on YouTube, and he has done podcasts before. However,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.840]   I'm certain that you'll find today's discussion to be very different than previous podcasts that David has been featured on.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380]   The reason is that, of course, we get into his accomplishments,
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.540]   we talk about the mindset that allowed him to achieve those things, but today David really lets us under the hood.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.300]   He lets us into the form of inner dialogue that he has to embrace, indeed, that he has to grapple with on a daily basis,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.540]   sometimes multiple times throughout the day and night, in order to impose the sort of self-discipline that he is so well known for.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.660]   We also get into some of the scientific mechanisms underlying willpower, and we talk about David's current endeavors that include, for instance,
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.100]   his own exploration of science and medicine, for which he has become an intense scholar and practitioner.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.000]   I should mention that,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.620]   multiple times throughout today's discussion, you will hear curse words. Now, David and I both acknowledge that cursing isn't for everybody, and
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.500]   that cursing itself is different than cursing at somebody. Nonetheless, we do realize that many people,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.220]   parents perhaps, especially,
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.560]   might not want to hear cursing. If you don't want to hear cursing, well, then this podcast episode is probably not for you.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.340]   However, if you are comfortable with cursing, or if you can tolerate it, I assure you today's discussion is highly worthwhile.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.700]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.080]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.780]   public. In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.160]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.740]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before on this podcast,
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:56.040]   and there's general consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of protein per pound of body weight.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   Now, when one strives to do that,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.280]   it's important to maximize the quality of that protein intake to the calorie ratio, because you don't want to consume an excess of calories
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.560]   when trying to get that one gram of protein per pound of body weight. Maui
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.700]   Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein-to-calorie ratio, so it makes getting that one gram of protein per pound of body weight
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.840]   extremely easy. It's also delicious. Personally, I like the ground venison.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.560]   I also like the venison steaks. And then, for convenience, when I'm on the road,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.800]   I like the jerky. The jerky is a very high protein-to-calorie ratio,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.680]   so it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick, and it has something like only like 55 calories.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.720]   So again, making it very easy to get enough protein without consuming excess calories.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.880]   If you would like to try Maui Nui Venison, you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman

[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.140]   AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee, but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.840]   I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago, and I've been using one ever since.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.080]   AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.680]   And I knew of Alan because he had also built the so-called Aerobie Frisbee,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.800]   which I believe at one time, perhaps still now, held the Guinness Book of World Records for furthest thrown object.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.640]   And I used to see Alan, believe it or not, at parks around Palo Alto testing out different Aerobie Frisbee.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.240]   So he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.880]   Now, I love coffee. I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day, usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.640]   Although not always. Sometimes if I'm going to exercise, I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:53.020]   But I love, love, love coffee. And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:01.760]   I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.620]   as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee, even the traditional French press.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.760]   The AeroPress is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.200]   In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.880]   I'll just ask for some hot water and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.580]   If you'd like to try AeroPress, you can go to AeroPress.com/huberman.

[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.840]   AeroPress ships anywhere in the USA, Canada and over 60 other countries around the world.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.280]   Again, that's AeroPress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.460]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.720]   Now, a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.240]   your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.960]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.560]   One of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times, at the beginning and throughout,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.320]   and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   And that's what Eight Sleep allows you to do.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.680]   It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.720]   Each morning, feeling incredibly refreshed and energized.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.840]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for almost three years now,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.760]   and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.000]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to EightSleep.com/huberman
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.160]   to get $150 off their pod three mattress cover.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.120]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.360]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.840]   Again, that's EightSleep.com/huberman.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.960]   And now for my discussion with David Goggins.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.280]   David Goggins, welcome.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.600]   - My man.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.640]   Good to see you again, man.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.480]   - Great to see you.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   It was late 2016, early 2017, I believe,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.920]   when you were in my lab at Stanford.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.880]   - Yes, sir.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.520]   - We did a little work later that day down in San Jose
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   and gosh, see you everywhere, but it's not enough.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.680]   So great to have you here.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.760]   - Thanks for having me on, brother.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.400]   - Yeah.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.760]   You embody discipline and doing hard things.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.580]   - Right.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.160]   - I think you should just start right off with the bold truth.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.280]   But right before we went hot mics.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.820]   - Right.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.320]   - We were talking about learning.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.260]   - Right.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.760]   - Right now you're spending some time learning
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.440]   and doing things that I think most people
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.000]   probably don't typically associate David Goggins with.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.840]   - Right.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.680]   - Why don't you tell us about that?
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.320]   - Well, most people just look at me as the guy
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.440]   that runs and yells as he's running.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.480]   And that's while I do that, you know, to motivate people,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.880]   but people don't understand that my day
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.520]   is broken up into segments.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.740]   I work out, I eat, I sleep,
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.240]   but I spend most of my time studying.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.080]   So like I'm in the medical world,
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.280]   I'm a paramedic in Canada,
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.720]   but I spend a lot of my time trying to nuke
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.320]   every single thing about it
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.240]   because I'm not trying to just be a paramedic,
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.760]   learn about veins and arteries
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   and how the heart pumps and stuff like that.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.580]   I'm trying to learn to the point
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.400]   where I can save someone's life.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.920]   And even though paramedics are doing that
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.540]   all over the world, I'm trying to be that paramedic
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.380]   that can really dissect exactly what's going on
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.820]   and figure out what medication goes where.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.360]   Just trying to learn the algorithm of what's going on, man.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.020]   So I spend a lot of time with it.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.240]   - I love the word algorithm
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.920]   'cause when I teach biology or try and learn anything
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   that's related to biology and especially the human body,
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.120]   I need to know the nouns, but it's the verbs that matter.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.340]   And that's really what you're talking about.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.040]   Like just saying that sits there, that brain part there,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.380]   doesn't tell you how it all works together.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.040]   So what is your process for studying look like?
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.000]   Like if we dropped a camera in the room,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   but a microphone into your inner dialogue.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.200]   Gosh, wouldn't we all love that?
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.680]   But if we dropped a microphone into your inner dialogue,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.160]   are you waking up looking at the books and going,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.440]   "Yeah, fresh day, let's learn."
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.880]   Or is some of the same resistance
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.880]   that you've talked about coming up around physical work,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.560]   is that coming up from time to time?
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.380]   - You know what?
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.820]   I was nervous at first.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.040]   I'm gonna keep it real.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.320]   I'm gonna keep it real.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.600]   So I'm not a real smart guy.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.080]   And what I mean by that is I was born with ADD, ADHD.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.880]   My brain cannot retain information.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.080]   I'm not some genetic freak when it comes to running,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.080]   when it comes to lifting weights.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.760]   I am absolutely the bottom of the barrel
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.920]   and people will never believe me.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.740]   And they can just, you know, whatever,
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.480]   believe what you wanna believe.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.160]   So when you're asking this question
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.760]   about what does studying look like for me,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.600]   I have to go over the same page
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.320]   over and over and over and over again.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.960]   While Jennifer can look at that page,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.780]   while she's, you know, quizzing me,
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.720]   she'll learn it, right?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.000]   Then as she's chilling on anything about it,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.460]   she will quiz herself or quiz me
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.700]   and learn it as she's quizzing me.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.480]   It's the most frustrating thing in the world
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.020]   how my brain works.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.880]   So what I do is I literally sit there
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.920]   with a pen and paper and I have my books
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   and I go through and have to write everything down
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.200]   every single day.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   I will study the same page until it's photographic memory
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.240]   from writing the same thing down.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.980]   And then from there, I'll go back through
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.500]   and relearn again.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.120]   So I'll learn the bulk of it,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   but then I'll go through and learn the small things
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.100]   within that.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.240]   So if it's a medication,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.780]   I'll learn what the medication does.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.980]   First, I'll learn how to even say the medication
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.980]   because these medications aren't like, you know,
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.660]   like Albuterol.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   No, it's very big words.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.700]   So I'll go through, learn how to say the name.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   Then I'll go through, learn what the dose is.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.580]   Then I'll go through and this is like every single day.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580]   So not like, oh, I got it.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.420]   Let's just go through.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.260]   No, nothing is I got it.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.020]   Every single thing.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.540]   So I can't wait to get in this conversation
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.480]   'cause everything I do in life, it sucks.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.660]   Everything I do in life, it sucks.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.540]   That's why when I was 300 pounds and 24 years old,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.140]   it wasn't like I had some big epiphany
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.800]   of let's just go be a Navy SEAL and let's lose some weight.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.560]   No, I knew my entire life was gonna be a struggle,
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.780]   which is why I just ignored it.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.100]   And I said, I'm not even trying to jump off into this shit
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.700]   and learn how to read, how to write, how to memorize,
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.820]   how to become something I am not.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.220]   But through that process, something happened to me.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.260]   And I realized this is why I feel sorry for no one.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.440]   In this podcast, they're gonna really not like me
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   because people are gonna think that I am maybe lying
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.300]   or maybe fibbing or exaggerating.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.160]   No, I am literally, I was the lowest form on earth,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.580]   no talent, no ability to learn.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.380]   And I literally know what it is to be rock bottom
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.900]   and to build that up.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.020]   So that question about learning, it's a pain in my ass
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.940]   and I don't have to do it.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.780]   So think about it.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.660]   I'm 49 years old and I'm a multimillionaire.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.940]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.460]   So all I thought about when I was growing up is,
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.860]   man, I can't wait to one day get to the point
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.900]   where I no longer have to do this stuff.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.220]   But what happens, I got older, it became a way of living.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.900]   So how I do every day is how I do every day.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.260]   It's a discipline, it's a regimen.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.820]   It was a choice I made.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.820]   And the choice I made was, what are you willing to sacrifice
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.760]   and what are you willing to give up
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.980]   to find every bit of who you are as a human being?
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.120]   And I was willing to give up everything to do that.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.740]   So studying is no joke.
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.700]   - I love that you're studying.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.900]   I recall a few years ago,
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.620]   I heard some interview or podcast with you
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.180]   and you just threw out like, I don't know what I'll do next.
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.760]   Maybe I'll be a scientist, right?
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.860]   And I went, yeah.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.380]   I was like, 'cause I knew, 'cause I know you a bit
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.580]   and I see your work out there, but we'd met before
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.540]   that if you decided that you were gonna do it.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.620]   And learning medicine, which is what you're doing,
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.540]   learning human physiology, is so detailed.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.900]   And people out there have to understand
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.900]   when you look at a textbook and you see the veins
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.660]   and the capillaries, different colors,
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.140]   when the body's open, they're not different colors, right?
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.680]   So, I mean, some things have different color contrast,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.660]   but it's not like it's all labeled when you pop it open.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.460]   And so the process of writing things down by hand
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.500]   is important for you.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.820]   So you go back and read those notes.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   Do you think about that stuff on your runs too?
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.780]   Are you segmenting your day, like when you're done studying,
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.580]   are you heading out for a run
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.920]   and thinking about other things,
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.440]   or are you still rehearsing the material in your head?
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.860]   - So when I write it down, I write it down
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.300]   and I'm able to, I'm actually looking down
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.980]   at this table right now, 'cause I'm back to write,
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.340]   so I'm actually there right now as I'm speaking to you.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.020]   I write it down in a way that I'm memorizing page 69.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.980]   So I'm writing it down, so then writing it down
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.260]   in that page sync together in my brain.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.900]   So I'm looking at the book in my brain right now.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.140]   So like, that's just how it works for me.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.380]   And I have to do it over and over again.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.700]   So that page is stuck in my mind.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.080]   So I'm literally flipping through pages
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.820]   as I'm taking these tests
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.100]   and I'm taking these national tests to become a paramedic
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.580]   or become a advanced EMT or whatever.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.220]   I'm literally, as I'm taking that test, I'm going through
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.060]   and I'm like,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.780]   now I'm flipping pages in my head of where that page was
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.040]   and how I do that is just from how I write it
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.560]   and how it's on the page.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.860]   When I run, I can't recall any of it.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.680]   I cannot bring any of that because I'm running.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.060]   How my mind is wired now is that everything I do
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.720]   is what I do because the focus it takes for me to,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.540]   like right now, I'm running.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.920]   I'm not like a great runner.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   I'm not like injury free.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.220]   So like my first 20 minutes of the run, I'm limping.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.380]   I'm literally limping
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.980]   because I've had several knee surgeries
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.580]   and my body was twisted and so now it's untwisting.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.740]   So people look at me, oh, it looks like he's limping,
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.180]   you know, like limping when he runs.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.940]   I am limping when I run.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.900]   My body's jacked up.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.460]   So I'm focusing on how to get the best out of a broken body.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.220]   So everything I do is a total focus
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.340]   on what I'm doing at that point in my life.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.920]   - So it seems like you've really trained away
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.880]   or somehow gotten away from the ADD that you mentioned
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.960]   because what you described is like a deep trench.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.380]   It's like a V-shaped trench.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.800]   I'm imagining like there's a ball bearing
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   and it's like, and it can only go forward in that trench
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.480]   or back and it goes forward.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.520]   It's not like sliding around at the,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.960]   like concave at the bottom, like attention.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.200]   So it's like you've trained that up.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.080]   Is there a similar feeling when you're in the full focus
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.220]   of running versus full focus of studying?
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.920]   Is it kind of feel like, oh yeah, that's the same groove
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.280]   but different thing?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   Or is it just completely different world?
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.320]   - It's a completely different world.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.820]   Like it's just both of them for me is suffering
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.660]   but suffering a whole different way.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.480]   Like when I was going through school, I'll never forget.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   I think I was in third grade and back then, you know,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.760]   ADD, ADHD wasn't like, you know, here's this medicine
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.840]   or here's this thing.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.040]   They want to put you in a special school.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.340]   So for me, I was so far behind in learning
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.720]   that their big thing was, let's just put him
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.780]   in a special school because he'll never learn.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.000]   And through that process of like, I don't want to be
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.680]   in a special school.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.500]   I don't want to be treated any differently.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.500]   It really, like I never took medication.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   I've never taken medication for this.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.680]   That's why right now you see me looking right in your eyes.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.200]   What the hell is, you know, it's human saying right now.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.920]   And that's why I don't feel bad for people
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.520]   who have ADHD, who have learning disabilities.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.080]   And some are impossible because you just can't.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.840]   But a lot of them, you can.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.520]   And, but people don't want to go through the process
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.580]   of focus, of teaching yourself how to truly focus.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.940]   This is where my message gets lost.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.600]   It gets lost because I may say, you know, MF or F.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.280]   You know, I may be because that's the passion
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.200]   that comes out of me.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.360]   Because that's, it takes everything for me to learn a sentence.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.320]   So when I speak about David Goggins, I can't speak
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.280]   about David Goggins in a way that's just calm and cool.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.720]   Because when I wake up, I know the journey that it takes
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.400]   for me to find my greatness.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.840]   And it's hard.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.400]   Nothing is easy.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.480]   Nothing just like, oh, I wake up and I just do this or I do that.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.560]   Or it just, you know, I watch people every day go
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.680]   through life and it's so easy.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.120]   For me to be where I'm at today, it takes every bit of me.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.160]   So when I speak about it, and as I get going here,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.080]   you'll start seeing me, the tempo will rise.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.520]   The passion will come out.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.960]   Because I'm back there.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.080]   I'm doing what I do every day to become a human being.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.240]   And so nothing is easy.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.980]   Like, running is running.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.880]   It sucks. But you have a choice to make.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.560]   Do you want to sit down and go back to that guy you once were?
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.360]   No. So this is what it takes.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.200]   It takes that misunderstanding of people
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.520]   and they'll never get it because they were never David Goggins.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.720]   So that is what it takes for me to do what I do.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.820]   It may take you something differently.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.800]   So for me, everything has to be in the studying.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.100]   Everything has to be in the this.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.420]   Everything has to be everywhere I am has to be there.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.560]   Me. Focus where I am.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.800]   That's why you're my second podcast I've done since Rogan
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.960]   since the book came out.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.560]   I don't have time for that shit.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.480]   Because if I want to be great, I'm not trying to maximize money
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.920]   or maximize people knowing me.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.720]   I do these things because maybe someone out there
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.520]   will understand me and get it
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.740]   and say, "I can grow from this guy."
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.640]   And others just won't.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.720]   - Sounds like friction is something
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.960]   you're very familiar with.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.120]   I just, it's a word just that I feel like it's like
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.080]   cast above us right now in bold face,
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.560]   highlighted, underlined letters.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.320]   It's just like friction. - Friction is growth.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.200]   - Like you're up in the morning
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.620]   and I imagine David Goggins going to the coffee maker,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.520]   stretching out, good morning, sunshine.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.000]   And you're telling me from eyelids open, there's friction.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.360]   - Yes, and that is the thing that people don't,
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.640]   they don't fucking get.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.700]   The biggest misunderstanding about David Goggins
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.000]   of all time, it's like whether you believe in God or not,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.840]   I do.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.320]   He put this lab rat, which is me, on this planet
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   and said, "Let me fucking see what a beat up abused kid
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.620]   who has, who can barely learn, barely learn,
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.020]   who has a twisted body, messed up genetics, sickle cell,
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.260]   this and that, let me give him everything
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.180]   that pretty much disqualifies you from the military."
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.380]   But back then, it wasn't estrus.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.020]   And let's put him in this and see what comes out of it.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.300]   So to do that, friction, you don't wake up
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.460]   in the morning time and go to the coffee maker.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.860]   Matter of fact, sometimes you don't even sleep.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.800]   What it requires is when I'm at two o'clock in the,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.880]   it's two o'clock in the morning,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.640]   and my brain is thinking about a fucking drug,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.660]   and I got to get up and look in my book
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.800]   to see if that drug is how I remember it.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.480]   And this is every day of my fucking life.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.840]   That's when I train a fighter or I train some,
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.420]   I'm like, you have no fucking idea how great you really are
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   because you are using such minimal, minimal of what you have.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.560]   And if people can learn to focus, this is what's possible.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.340]   While it may not be pretty,
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.060]   like people want to do a documentary on me.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.240]   I go, no, I don't want you to do a documentary on me
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.880]   because I will have normal, everyday people
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.760]   picking me apart on his life is miserable.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.740]   Who wants to live like that?
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.740]   He looks, it's crazy how he,
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.840]   it's almost like he's sick, he's psychotic.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.060]   The most frustrating thing in the world for me
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.660]   is when normal people judge a man like myself
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.660]   on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:01.560]   It takes every bit of who you are, if you choose that route.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.720]   If you don't, Merry Christmas, do what you got to do.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.560]   But yeah, all these things for me,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.480]   like I told you, I'm going to keep it real.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.160]   I'm not coming here to talk about like,
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.440]   you know, perform without purpose.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.720]   'Cause I go through, when I write these books,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.120]   I go through and try to dumb down David Goggins.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.600]   How can I give normal people, and I'm normal,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.200]   but I found something that most don't want to find.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.680]   How can I speak to people and give them something
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.160]   from this crazy psychotic brain that I've developed?
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.460]   How can I give them that?
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.480]   So I sit down with Jennifer for years
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.520]   and write down, perform without purpose,
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.740]   callous your mind, armor your mind,
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.320]   the cookie jar, the accountability mirror,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.400]   shit that people can fucking use in their lives.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.580]   No, no, I'm glad it helps you,
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.460]   but the barbaric life that I live, that you have to live,
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.440]   the almost obsession that you must have to be great,
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.220]   you can't put that shit in a fucking book, bro.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.740]   You can't put it in a book, you can't.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.660]   You can't write about it.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.920]   - It has to be experienced.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.440]   - It has to be experienced.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.160]   And you can't even, after you experienced it,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.400]   to write it in a book, it would seem like
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.200]   he needs to be locked up.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.280]   - Too gory.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.280]   - It's too gory, doesn't make sense for a guy
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.560]   that everything, every second of the day,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.120]   he is trying to extract more from something.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.480]   He's constantly thinking, he's constantly disciplined,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.360]   never going off the path.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.740]   Whatever is injured on him, he figures away.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.940]   It's a conqueror's mindset.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.220]   And very few people, if any,
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.880]   can really understand what that is.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.260]   Like, I'm almost 50,
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.140]   and I've been this way for almost 30 years.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.780]   Like, what do you do for fun?
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.580]   You never, these questions, I don't get 'em,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.340]   I don't understand 'em, I don't, so yeah.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.980]   - I get asked that sometimes, what do you do for fun?
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.940]   I start listing off all this stuff like podcasting,
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.420]   reading, working out.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.160]   So some of that resonates.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.940]   But I think what's so truly unusual
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.040]   about what you're describing, your process,
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.820]   is that from go, it's hard.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.880]   And I have to ask, was being 300 pounds,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.220]   having, I'm using the words you've described,
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.500]   you've said it before, you had a tendency
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.480]   at one point in your life, early on, tell lies,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.300]   try and get people's approval, crazy haircuts,
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   attention seeking, and yet all of that triggered something
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.800]   that now is extraordinary.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.100]   Do you think those hardships were necessary
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.880]   to flip the switch?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.900]   - I don't know if they were necessary,
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.380]   but it was something that made me feel,
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.280]   I didn't feel good, it was easy.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.560]   The brain that I was given as a child,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.900]   it was easy to go home and think about
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.340]   how do I want to be a freak today?
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.020]   How do I want to show up to school today and be a freak?
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.220]   It didn't require me going home and opening a book up
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.860]   saying it's going to take me all year
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.880]   to learn this fucking page.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.380]   So instead of learning that page,
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.640]   I learned how to become a character.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.980]   And maybe that character that I created,
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.420]   that 300 pound insecure guy that used to fake it
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.220]   'til I make it type of guy, let me become your friend,
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.580]   let me lie to you until you like me type of guy.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:53.880]   When you have any kind of, any manhood, womanhood,
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.580]   a human being, a soul, a spirit, any,
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.520]   I had no, I must have just this much pride,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.000]   'cause that's exactly what opened the door for me.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.560]   'Cause every day you were a character,
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.860]   every day you were a clown, every day you opened
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.440]   that Spanish book or that science book or English book
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.920]   and you looked at it and it was like,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.700]   it looked like a foreign language.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.200]   And you're saying, where do I start?
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.100]   Where do I start?
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.700]   And obviously it was necessary.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.240]   The more I talk about it, it was necessary
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.220]   'cause what happened is I became haunted
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.760]   by the mere fact that this is my existence.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.340]   And you gotta live with that.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.360]   I lived with it for a lot of years.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.700]   And so I sat back and said, okay, all right,
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.780]   I know what this takes.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.980]   And when you sit back as fucked up as I was
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.360]   and I had a laundry list, a table like this
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.180]   of what I have to do to become just a human being
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.900]   that can make ends meet, that can make a thousand dollars
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.380]   a month just to get there was like, oh my God, dude.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.960]   I'm 16, 17, I can't read, I can't write.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.620]   And I, oh my God, I'm so behind the power curve
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.940]   and my brain is about being depressed.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.580]   And my dad beat my mom's now home
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.980]   and kids are calling me nigger at school.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.720]   And I'm like, oh my God, man, what the fuck do I do?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.540]   And it wasn't like someone came around and said, hey man,
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.220]   you can do this.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.060]   This is all me.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.420]   Some people know where's this cold man come from.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.720]   I'm not trying to be cold.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.860]   It's the reality of my life.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.500]   It's the reality of a lot of people's lives.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.260]   And so, yeah, that had to happen for me to be haunted,
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.040]   to be haunted, to pull out, to extract the guy in today.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.800]   That haunting is something that's still there today
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.620]   because no matter how much you improve,
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.500]   no matter how much you change who you are,
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   it's not permanent.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.900]   You'll just wake up and say, oh my God, man,
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.300]   you're David Goggins, you break records,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.380]   you do this, you do that.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.380]   People don't know, how are you able to just be so hard
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.540]   can I never turn the fucking thing off?
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.020]   'Cause once it turns off,
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.300]   I go right back to the David Goggins that is.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.480]   And that's the guy that I'm constantly fighting every day.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.140]   And it's a choice.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.260]   And that choice makes you misunderstood.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.420]   It makes you crazy.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.600]   That's why I hate fucking social media.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.780]   In 2013, people wanted me to write my book.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.180]   I did it in 2018, took five years.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.940]   And the reason why I didn't do it,
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.080]   I sat at a table and Jennifer was there.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.380]   This is before she started working for me.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.300]   I started dating or whatever.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.380]   And all these people were there and they're like,
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.700]   man, you gotta go on social media.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.660]   And I was like, fuck you, man.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.380]   Like I'm not, it's poison.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.340]   It's poison because I knew what I did to get where I am.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.900]   And I'm gonna have these people,
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.540]   these normal everyday people, fat, lazy,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.160]   is exactly who I was, judging me.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.940]   'Cause I know it, 'cause I was once them.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.700]   All my hard work, all my dedication,
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.660]   I'm gonna have some normal dude,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.160]   get his little brownies, little ding dong, ho ho Twinkie,
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.840]   sit there with his coffee, picking me apart.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.120]   Oh, he must be unhappy.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.280]   He's just, do you know how hard it is
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.080]   to put these shoes on every damn morning?
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.000]   I'm gonna have you pick me apart.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   So yeah, there's so much that goes into this
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.600]   that I was like, fuck this.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.060]   I never want anything to do with it.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.100]   So anyway.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.600]   - I'm not a psychologist,
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.140]   but knowing your story from what you've written,
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.860]   what you've said on social media and elsewhere, podcasts,
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.100]   and here now especially, it's amazing to me.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.280]   And frankly, it pulls at my heartstrings a little bit.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.780]   I realize that's not what you're trying to do,
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.260]   but that in the course of your childhood
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.500]   and in your young adulthood,
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.420]   that no one ever got between you and the world.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.580]   I forget where I heard it,
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.180]   that if a kid has just one person that believes in them.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.920]   And I had my trials and tribulations,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.180]   but I had great coaches, great mentors.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.500]   I attached to them.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.020]   I found them if they didn't necessarily find me.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.340]   But I'm realizing that your situation was
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.380]   no one's ever said, hey, I'm gonna stand here next to you
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.240]   or get in front of you, put a shield up.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.220]   And so it's almost like you've got these different,
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.100]   it's all you, but there's versions of yourself
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   that you knew, social media,
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.460]   I don't know that I have the wherewithal in 2013,
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.860]   '14, '15, '16, '17 to get in front of myself
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.940]   while doing all this,
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.260]   'cause I've already got so much going on in here.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.300]   Is that about right?
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.660]   - That is right, but I had developed a lot of anger
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.500]   and I still have it.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.740]   And it would never go away
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.240]   for the normal human beings of this world.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.660]   Because when you put yourself in the sewer like I was in,
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.940]   and please, if someone saved me,
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.300]   come out and announce it to the world.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.040]   There was no one.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.340]   There's no one.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.420]   So when you know that,
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.180]   and then I'm sitting at a table
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.100]   with all these smart people who are telling me
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.540]   what to do and shit and guiding me through my life now,
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.540]   when I'm 40 fucking years old,
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.740]   I was, I don't know, 40 something years old, now I'm 49.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.580]   And I'm looking at them all
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.540]   and they're now trying to guide me on what's right
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.280]   on this poison.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.820]   And so, yeah, what you say is right,
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.380]   but for me, it was more of, I know now.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.460]   I don't need you to guide my future.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.820]   I know what's good for me and what's bad for me.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.580]   And for me, it took every bit of focus I could.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.140]   And I know social media,
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.260]   that's why people love to go on there
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.880]   because they wanna show you the good side of life.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.220]   I'm not teaching good side of life.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.280]   So I had to figure out a way when I came on in 2016
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.980]   of teaching you what life really is
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.580]   for the majority of us as hell.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.820]   And so while people love to show you the cars
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.260]   and the house and the vacations and shit,
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.460]   all that's good, all that's happy.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.340]   I'm gonna show you this side
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.660]   that I know most of you are going through.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.140]   And people hide very well.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.640]   I don't wanna hide anymore.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.400]   I hid it for 24 fucking years.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.640]   That's why now I told you,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.800]   we can talk about whatever you want.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.840]   Because as human beings,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.300]   the first thing we have to learn,
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.140]   I also studied real bad growing up.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.000]   So if you hear me stutter every now and then,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   it's because that was part of my life also.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.980]   So it's funny, human beings wanna show you the best side
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.020]   and they wanna hide the worst side.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.540]   For me, I'm gonna teach you how to be vulnerable.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.980]   'Cause that's the only way you fix yourself.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.940]   You don't fix yourself by coming out here
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.820]   and me selling you some fucking books.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.080]   That's why I don't have them, I forgot them.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.420]   I'm glad people got something from the book.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:20.420]   I want you to learn that the only way you grow
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.020]   is how to look at yourself and say, okay, like I did.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.300]   Table longer than this,
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.460]   what the fuck I have to do to get somewhere?
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.240]   There was nothing good on there, nothing.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.700]   Yeah, I love playing basketball, I left that out.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.580]   That's something I love to do.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.740]   I don't care about that, that didn't make the fucking list.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.840]   'Cause the list that I had to live by was the very list
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.160]   that was to get me at this table with you.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.460]   To talk to you, to the normal human beings,
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.700]   which I once was, about how you can get somewhere
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.680]   and how it looks, it looks very ugly.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.460]   There's no fucking passion, there's no fucking motivation.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.720]   There's no, oh my God, man, I fucking, this is, no.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.020]   It's every day of your life just doing.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.360]   No passion, no discipline, no motivation.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.820]   All these words, I hate people, I hate that so many people
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.620]   fucking use these words now 'cause it's watered.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.420]   It's someone sitting in a room by themselves
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.860]   and they figure themselves out and say,
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.260]   "God, this is gonna fucking suck."
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.140]   Where's passion when you're 300 pounds?
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.020]   Where's the motivation when you can't read and write?
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.060]   Where is it?
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.940]   So how did this happen?
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.900]   I just fucking did.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.420]   I did, I just did.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.780]   I said, "Maybe at the end of this journey,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.040]   "there'll be something there for me.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   "If not, I can read.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.580]   "If not, I'm 185 fucking pounds."
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.120]   There's no magic potion.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.520]   There's no, oh, let me wake up and look at some shit.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.540]   No, all those words are overused.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.020]   They're bullshit.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.620]   It's all bullshit.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.120]   Just do your living.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.500]   How do you wanna live?
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.980]   How do you wanna die?
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.500]   How do you wanna fucking be remembered?
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.120]   That's it, that's it, period.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.180]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.620]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.920]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.760]   that's designed to meet
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.980]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.620]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.920]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.180]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.840]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.820]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.580]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.740]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.540]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.080]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.300]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.080]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.880]   "If you could take just one supplement, what would it be?"
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.560]   I answer, "AG1."
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.260]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.720]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.480]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.140]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.200]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.980]   - The word haunted is ringing in my head.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.820]   - Yep.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.320]   - I think it's such a powerful word.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.160]   - Yep.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.220]   - 'Cause I was about to say,
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.500]   it seems like a huge part of your process,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.660]   maybe the entire process is it's all stick, no carrot.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.820]   You know, you talk about the carrot, the positive thing,
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.820]   and then there's the stick, the thing you're trying to avoid.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.660]   - Yep.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.920]   - I feel like it's, the way it's landing for me
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.640]   is it's all stick and gas pedal.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.480]   - That's it.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.880]   - There's no carrot.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.260]   You're not imagining, "Oh, when I'm a paramedic,
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.880]   when the book is published."
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.200]   And obviously you set those goals
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.040]   and you make those targets, but it's all stick.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.340]   - All stick.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.180]   - No carrot.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.020]   - Think about that.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.840]   I'm waking up right now, studying,
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.240]   like I have a test tomorrow.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.880]   I already passed the fucking test.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.520]   Think about that.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.360]   Every day of my life,
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.000]   that's what I must do just to retain what I learned.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.560]   Four hours plus a day, I go through and do that.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.400]   There's no stick, or there's only a stick.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.120]   There's never been a carrot.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.660]   Which is why when I speak to people,
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:28.120]   I have to figure out a way to resonate with them.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.900]   'Cause all I wanna say to them is,
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.040]   (chuckles)
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.600]   let me teach you the real life, how it really is.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.280]   The reason why you're a loser,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.360]   and the reason why you're not fucking making it,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.320]   and the reason why you're trying to go through all these,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.900]   I go to all these fucking conventions,
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.960]   speak all the fucking time.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.360]   I look in the fucking audience and these people sign up,
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.520]   sign up, sign up fucking every year to go to convention,
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.600]   thinking they're gonna learn something fucking different.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.000]   No, you're lazy.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.920]   You know exactly what to do, exactly what to do.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.240]   'Cause even me, in my state of, I can't read or write,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.920]   I knew exactly what to do.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.560]   It just sucks doing it.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.740]   It sucks to do it.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.260]   It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say,
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.900]   "God, man, I'm not smart, so guess what I gotta do?
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.080]   I gotta study the same shit
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.180]   that I got one of the highest scores in the nation on,
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.220]   and do it again, do it again, do it again."
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.740]   It's not just there.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.280]   It's not just there permanently for me.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.480]   So yeah, it's all stick.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.240]   It's all stick.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:41.120]   The only care that you have is like, maybe, maybe,
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.840]   'cause whenever I take these tests that are real hard,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.800]   in the back of my brain, it's like,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.360]   the good chance you're not gonna make it, Goggins.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.560]   This ain't you, bro.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.880]   This ain't you.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.120]   You weren't born like this.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.240]   This ain't you, the real you, bro.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.280]   Study all you want to,
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.240]   but the second that fucking computer comes on
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.600]   with 150 questions, this ain't you, man.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.720]   And somehow, it comes back, I passed.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.380]   I passed again, passed again.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.380]   But that real me back here, every fucking time,
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.480]   is saying, "That ain't you, bro.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.500]   That ain't you."
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.280]   And I have to outwork that voice.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.140]   When I'm taking that test and I get to a question,
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.920]   I don't fucking know the answer, I'm like, "Fuck, man."
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.280]   And then, say, "I told you, man, that ain't you.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.240]   You 300 pounds, man.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.100]   You sit at home, you figure out how to do your hair.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.040]   That's what you do, how to come to school
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.200]   with the reverse baldness when you're 16.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.560]   That's you."
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   So there is no get out of jail free card.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.860]   This is why I say stay hard,
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.360]   because when you weren't given the gifts,
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.200]   the only thing you can do in life is stay hard.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.420]   And I know people cannot stand me.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.620]   They can't stand this talk.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:07.880]   This is all you can do.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.260]   There's no magic pill or a magic potion.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.720]   All you can do is outwork the man that God created,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.660]   or woman, in you.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.040]   And what that looks like is unfun.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   That's why I said do not do a documentary on me,
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   because people will not see the truth.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.520]   They will see what they want to see
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.840]   is I don't want to live like that.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.840]   Good. Good.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.680]   And you will live exactly the way you live now,
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.280]   questioning who you are, wondering what is possible,
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.960]   wondering what you are capable of doing.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.240]   That's how that looks.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.200]   Or you can be me, which, am I happy?
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.040]   I don't know.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.360]   Never thought about it, don't really care about it,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.440]   because all I really cared about
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.680]   was when I looked in that fucking mirror,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.840]   I saw a piece of shit.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.080]   Happiness wasn't on the mirror at 16,
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.840]   around 300 pounds.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.620]   It wasn't like, oh my, I'm looking for happiness.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.140]   No, I'm looking to look at myself in the mirror and say,
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.280]   all right, motherfucker, you did it again today.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.160]   You're a bad boy, because that shit sucks.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   I have about a couple of minutes of that
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.720]   when I got the carrot.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.480]   Second lay down to go to bed, the carrot's gone,
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.920]   because I'm waking up all through the night
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.600]   to check the work I did that day.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.920]   Did I get this drug right?
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.760]   Did I get this right?
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Did I get that right?
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.600]   What did I do?
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.920]   Oh my God, fuck, I'm already losing it.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.460]   It's a stick.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.800]   - That stick is haunting you.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.920]   - Haunting you. - It's following you around.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.680]   So no picture of Jordan on the wall.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.600]   You're not listening to a YouTube inspiration video.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.720]   - No. - That would be all your voice,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.820]   anyway. (laughs)
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.860]   You're not listening to your top 10 favorite songs
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.460]   just to get rolling and then lace the shoes, hit the books.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.660]   It's all in here.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.500]   - All in there.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.340]   I used to do that when I was fat.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.660]   Rocky, I mean, that was my thing.
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.240]   Round 14 was my thing.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.960]   And as I got older and older and older,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.900]   that started to go away.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.760]   And I started to create,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.720]   I had all these people that I used to watch.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.920]   Rocky was one, Barnes, Elias from Platoon,
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.660]   Jack from A Few Good Men.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.980]   You know, he's on the stand going crazy.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.600]   I saw a lot of these characters that I looked at
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.280]   and I was like, man, I ain't got none of that.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.520]   But they were characters.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:37.780]   After a while, I lived a life so disciplined
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.280]   that everybody that I once looked to,
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.200]   these fake characters, I built that as a man.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.100]   And when I was younger, I had this image in my mind
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.120]   of what does a man look like to me?
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.060]   And I got all these people who were bad-asses, characters.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.080]   And in my mind, I became that.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.500]   And that's what kept me going a lot
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.100]   was I had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.140]   and a little bit of that.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.540]   'Cause when you have no parents raising you
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.200]   and you have no role models growing up,
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.300]   you, it's not daydreaming.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.360]   You start to create a reality like, hmm,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.880]   maybe I can be that.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.660]   And after becoming this guy,
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.240]   that is the biggest thing I can ever do in my life
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.080]   is I became that guy that I once looked at all these guys
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.240]   and I look at myself like, God, who the fuck can do that?
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.640]   I can't.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.240]   But what it takes is a discipline that no one
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.880]   can ever even, they just don't, they don't understand it.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.720]   They don't understand.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.940]   Everybody has the ability to do it,
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.100]   but they just don't want to.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.500]   They want to keep asking questions
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.760]   and keep going to seminars.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.780]   And the greatness is right in you.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.620]   And that's why, once again, I say this a million times here,
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.060]   I do not feel sorry for you.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.540]   I will not sugar coat what I'm going to say to you
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.540]   because all of you know what I'm saying is the truth.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.840]   Everybody knows it's the truth.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.680]   This is what it looks like.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.960]   And you know it too.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.800]   You know it too.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.400]   This is, if you ain't got nothing,
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.940]   I hate to tell you what it looks like, it's ugly.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.000]   It's not a documentary.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.480]   It's not an HBO special.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.520]   You ain't gonna watch it, but hey, man,
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.340]   you guys gotta watch this.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.720]   No, it's like, oh God, this looks like a train wreck.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.560]   It's like a nightmare.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.720]   This looks like this guy got, no.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.260]   That's what it looks like.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.560]   Hard work looks horrible.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.240]   It's not motivating.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.940]   It's not motivating at all.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.400]   It ain't like Rocky round 14.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.340]   We get knocked down and go like this to Apollo Creed.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.260]   It looks like a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.800]   and there's no fucking way out.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:53.720]   But you have the fucking key, but you refuse to use it.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.760]   And that's nothing motivating about that.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.220]   So yes, no documentary on David Goggins.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.760]   - The real life, David Goggins is the documentary.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.400]   It's already being written.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.340]   - You're it.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.680]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.760]   I'm gonna share a little neuroscience tidbit,
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.920]   but I think it's one that you'll appreciate.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.580]   Most people don't know this,
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.600]   but there's a brain structure
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.000]   called the anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.020]   As we pointed out before, that's a noun, it's a name.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:23.920]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.280]   We could call it the cookie monster.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.000]   But what's interesting about this brain area
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.300]   is there are now a lot of data in humans,
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.980]   that's a mouse study,
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.880]   showing that when people do something they don't wanna do,
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.600]   like add three hours of exercise per day or per week,
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.140]   or when people who are trying to die and lose weight
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.200]   resist eating something.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.700]   When people do anything that they,
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.440]   and this is the important part, that they don't want to do.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.860]   It's not about adding more work.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.480]   It's about adding more work that you don't want to do.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.560]   This brain area gets bigger.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.000]   Now here's what's especially interesting
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.160]   about this brain area to me.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.800]   And by the way, I'm only learning this recently
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.960]   because it's new data, but there's a lot of it.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.840]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.520]   is smaller in obese people.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.620]   It gets bigger when they die.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.460]   It's larger in athletes.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:24.080]   It's especially large or grows larger
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.400]   in people that see themselves as challenged
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.040]   and overcome some challenge.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.440]   And in people that live a very long time,
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.920]   this area keeps its size.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.120]   In many ways, scientists are starting to think
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.760]   of the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.420]   not just as one of the seats of willpower,
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.040]   but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.280]   - Now we're talking.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.720]   - And when I learned about the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.440]   I was like almost out of my seat.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.880]   And I've been in the neuroscience game since I was 20.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.920]   - Now we're talking. - We're the same age.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.500]   And I was so pumped 'cause I've heard of the amygdala fear,
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.080]   prefrontal cortex, it's planning and action.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.000]   I could tell you every brain area and every,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.640]   I teach neuroanatomy to medical students.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.160]   But when I started seeing the data
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.860]   on the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:18.420]   I was like, whoa, this is interesting.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.440]   And all the data points to the fact
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.320]   that we can build this area up,
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.700]   but that as quickly as we build it up,
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.640]   if we don't continue to invest in things
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.360]   that are hard for us, that we don't want to do,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.580]   that's the part that feels so Goggin-esque to me
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.280]   that we don't want to do.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.520]   Like if you love the ice bath, yeah, I love the ice bath,
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.120]   and you go from one minute to 10 minutes, guess what?
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.080]   Your anterior mid-singulate cortex did not grow.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.640]   But if you hate the cold water,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.640]   if you're afraid of drowning and you get into water
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.440]   and put your head under, then your anterior mid,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.040]   and survive, then the anterior mid-singulate cortex
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.960]   gets bigger.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.920]   But if you don't do it the next day,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it,
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.960]   'cause hey, I did it yesterday, woo-hoo.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.200]   Happy me, Merry Christmas, as you would say.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.280]   Guess what?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.640]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex shrinks again.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.940]   To me, this is one of the most important discoveries
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.480]   that neuroscience has ever made,
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   because it's that I don't want to do something,
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.940]   but do it anyway, that grows this area.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.120]   And it's almost like I have a friend,
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.520]   he's been sober 30 years from alcohol.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.880]   And he always says, "You know, the amazing thing
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.120]   about addiction is there's a cure.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.080]   The problem is it only works one day at a time."
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.400]   And so you have to renew it every day.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.880]   So the anterior mid-singulate cortex, to me,
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.320]   when I learned about it, two things went off in my head.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.000]   Whoa, this is super interesting.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.860]   And two, I got to tell David Goggins about this.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.280]   And I waited until now to tell you,
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.640]   because I felt like, well, for obvious reasons,
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.360]   I wanted to tell you and I wanted to tell you here.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.920]   - Well, I love that because that's how I've lived
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.760]   my entire life.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.480]   I didn't know anything about that.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.200]   But people go, "Man, you have such a strong will.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.340]   It's something that you build."
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.840]   Like, I never forgot, I was on a podcast one time
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.700]   and this dude goes, "You were blessed with a strong mind."
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:15.080]   Like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.780]   I was blessed with a strong mind.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.380]   That's something that you have to develop.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.880]   You developed that over years, decades,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.560]   of suffering and going back into the suffer.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.200]   That's why a lot of people who graduate
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.360]   in Navy SEAL training, they want to know,
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.820]   like, in my, I talk about it very openly all the time,
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:43.080]   a lot of guys don't want to go back into that water.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.840]   They want to go back into the hard stuff.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.760]   Maybe not, anything hard, anything hard in life,
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.120]   once you get through it, it's like you become a POW.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.640]   Like, how many POWs you know want to go back to POW camp?
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.960]   None.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.320]   When something sucks so bad in life,
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.080]   this is on this that we're talking about now,
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:06.040]   very few people want to go back.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.480]   They're happy they graduated.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:13.400]   I realized I'm the same way, I don't want to go back.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.920]   I have to go back.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.600]   I must go back.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.640]   Because that is exactly where all the knowledge
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.600]   of my life exists, was back there,
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.540]   in which you're exactly what you're talking about.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.640]   Well, I didn't know anything about this,
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.340]   but how I grew a will was constantly doing these things.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.120]   To now, it's just life.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:40.560]   I wake up, while it still sucks, it's just life.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.300]   You don't sit back and like, oh my God,
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.000]   like, I have days I don't want to do,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.500]   but I know I'm going to do it.
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.580]   I know from years of just doing it.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.860]   So that's beautiful, and this is why I came on here
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.980]   with you today, and I'm glad you're talking about this,
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.660]   because human beings need to hear this.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.460]   They need to stop hearing these hacks
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.780]   on this and that.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.700]   There's no fucking hack, bro.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.860]   There's no fucking hack.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   Yeah, you made this and that and saunas and all this shit.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.700]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.620]   There is no fucking life hack.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.320]   To grow that thing, how do you grow it?
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.460]   Do it and do it and do it and do it.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.900]   That's the hack.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.900]   The hack is going to fucking suck,
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.600]   and that's what I realized.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.100]   That's what I realized.
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.600]   That's why I wanted to come on here today.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.440]   I didn't want to come on here
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.700]   and talk about no fucking passion and purpose
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.140]   and how to get the fuck out of bed
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.100]   and how to hit a fucking alarm clock
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.480]   and all this catchphrase bullshit,
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.160]   because that wasn't how I lived.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.440]   That wasn't how I lived.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.320]   I lived, I woke up like every human being does
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.460]   and goes, "Fuck, man, I'm a fucking piece of shit today.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.380]   "How the hell is this going to work out for me?"
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.220]   And you fight that, and you fight that.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.180]   You don't override it.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.700]   There's no override button.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.060]   It's the conversation in your fucking, in your head.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.660]   So how do you do that?
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.540]   We don't have enough of these conversations
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.500]   about the real conversation
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.140]   that every human being is having,
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.480]   and they have no idea how to get out of it, but they do.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.580]   It's that shit right there, man.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.540]   You got to build your will.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.200]   How do you build your will?
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.920]   Exactly what you said, man.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.600]   Exactly what you said.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.440]   - Well, I feel like knowing the name of something,
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.760]   anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.140]   doesn't fundamentally change us,
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:34.140]   but one thing I like about biology is that willpower,
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.360]   if somebody feels they don't have it,
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.220]   it feels like this thing that other people have,
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.160]   but everybody, unless they're brain damaged,
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.700]   like a hole through their head,
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.540]   has two anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.260]   One on each side of their brain.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.980]   Everyone has one.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.900]   They have two.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:55.900]   So I feel like it's just a question of opening the portal,
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.900]   and the portal, what I, again,
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.920]   I was gonna say 10 times and forgive me,
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.000]   is I think people go, oh, I do hard things.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.140]   I do sets to failure, and then I do four-streps.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.400]   I love training with weights.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.620]   I love doing sets to failure.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.540]   I even like four-streps, but guess what?
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:10.780]   I like four-streps.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.980]   So I'll tell you,
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.920]   they don't build my anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.940]   'cause I like to do it.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.780]   - That's right.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.220]   - Anything you like to do
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.940]   is not gonna enhance this aspect of willpower.
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.660]   And it seems so obvious once you hear it,
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.620]   you kinda go, oh yeah, of course.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.540]   But I think you really close that loop for people
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:33.180]   when you share what you're sharing today,
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.940]   and what you've shared elsewhere before as well,
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.780]   when you're trying to explain
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.320]   the friction is the critical ingredient.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.160]   - Right.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.940]   - And I think people think, oh, if it's effort,
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:41.980]   well, then I'm getting better.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.780]   That's part of it, necessary but not sufficient,
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.020]   as we say in science.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.320]   But the suck part,
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:52.500]   the being haunted, the stick,
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.020]   they're really unpleasant terms.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:54.840]   - Very.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.860]   - These are probably the most unpleasant terms
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.340]   we've ever used on this podcast.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.520]   - Very.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.540]   - Those are the levers.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.380]   Those are the gears.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.540]   And without those,
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.660]   this thing that you're talking about,
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.940]   David Goggins, as a verb,
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.860]   I'd sometimes make the joke, but it's not a joke.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.620]   Goggins is a name.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.940]   And it's a verb.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.340]   People go, I'm gonna Goggins that.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.180]   - Right.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.020]   - Right?
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.500]   But that's, I think, again, I'm not a psychologist,
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.820]   but I think that's what you're talking about.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.400]   The stick, the friction, being haunted.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.660]   It's the suck part that grows
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.500]   this anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.580]   - So now you know why there's so many people
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.540]   that have failed in this world,
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:40.100]   to figure out their purpose, their purpose in life.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.480]   Where do I go?
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   Because to grow that, you may not look like me,
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:52.120]   how my daily life looks, but don't look fun.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.600]   Don't look fun.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:00.200]   So it's a choice that people have to make in life.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.280]   But what's so funny about it is even the richest of rich
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.980]   who have everything, they always ask me this question.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.300]   I feel like I'm missing something.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.680]   I don't feel like I'm missing shit.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.320]   I don't have what you all have,
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.360]   but you'll never in my life hear me tell you
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.860]   I'm missing something.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.560]   Everybody is.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.260]   They're missing this feeling.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:29.580]   I found it a long time ago.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:33.140]   I found it right there in that willpower thing.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:36.020]   When you're nothing, nothing,
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.680]   and change yourself into something like me,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   you call it happiness, peace,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.840]   wherever the fuck you want to call it,
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:51.600]   people are missing exactly what went on with David Goggins.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.720]   Why don't you smile?
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.800]   I do, I do.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.300]   But I figure something out.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.320]   That's why I am never,
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.960]   you'll never hear me say I'm missing something.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.620]   I found it years ago.
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.540]   You find it in the suck.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.480]   You find it in the suck,
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.000]   and you find it repeatedly in the suck
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.520]   to the point where you know exactly who you are.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.200]   Most people are missing something
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.440]   because they don't know who they are.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.780]   They never examine themselves.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.520]   They've never done this experiment on themselves.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.800]   The lab rat, we're all lab rats,
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.300]   but you're also the scientist.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:31.200]   You create your own self.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.420]   Most people are missing something
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:36.220]   'cause there's so much trapped in there.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.540]   I don't even want to say potential.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.900]   I think that's where you use out too much too.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.980]   There's so much in you,
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.880]   that God or wherever the hell you believe in,
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.120]   or if you're an atheist, in you,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.260]   that you have not unlocked,
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.300]   that you walk around with this gorgeous wife
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.840]   or great husband and all this money.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.380]   You're like, "God, I feel like I'm missing something."
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.240]   Yeah, because it's about 75% of you
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.640]   is still fucking in there,
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.600]   still chained up,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.860]   because you just didn't want to find your willpower,
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.060]   didn't want to find your soul, your will, your heart,
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:10.580]   your determination, your guts, your courage.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.500]   And what that looks like, it looks scary,
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:15.180]   like your little scary lab I went in.
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.580]   Scary to wake up every day and say, "I'm stupid,
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.500]   but I want to figure out a way to be smarter,"
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.040]   versus saying, "Man, I just can't do that."
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.080]   So you limit this box.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.860]   So your box becomes so small of things you can do.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.300]   My box wasn't even a box.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.600]   It was a fucking little pinhole.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.200]   And then through examining myself,
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.160]   getting some willpower, some courage,
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.880]   it became bigger than this table.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.760]   But that's what we all do.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.860]   That's why I wanted to come here today
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.120]   and talk to you about real shit,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.280]   not no fucking like hacks.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.960]   There's no hacks, bro.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.000]   It's you against you.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.380]   You against you.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:58.220]   And if you misunderstand that, you have a real problem.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.000]   Real problem.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   I can understand you misunderstand me
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.560]   running down the street, shirt off,
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.860]   "Fuck this, no, yeah."
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.180]   I can get it, I get it.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.300]   If you misunderstand what I'm saying right now today,
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.700]   the problem is you and you don't want to fix it.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:17.380]   - Well, the children of wealthy people are a case study
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:22.140]   in how not having enough friction can destroy a life.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.100]   - True statement.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.220]   - I mean, I could list off prominent names in the press,
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.320]   but those are actually the least interesting.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.900]   What's probably more interesting as an example
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.100]   is all the ones we don't hear about,
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.760]   'cause we never hear about them.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.120]   They just dwindle and wither.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.700]   Or I think there's this big category of people
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:42.380]   I'm realizing as we have this conversation today
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.380]   that they're not super successful.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:48.980]   They're not struggling.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.900]   They're like successful enough that they never have to...
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.540]   You can get to the point where you don't have
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.140]   to impose friction.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.160]   You even said it.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.980]   Your bank account is in a place where you don't really
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.420]   need to do all the things you do.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.100]   Probably not even a small fraction of them.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:03.940]   - Do nothing.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.440]   - Right, but you realize the stick and being haunted
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.740]   is the fuel in the engine.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.300]   And you'd be truly crazy to give that up
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.540]   because you've internalized all that.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:20.020]   But most people, they're good enough for them.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:24.180]   And so they don't actually want to be better badly enough
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:28.780]   in order to start going rung after rung.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.080]   - Well, think about when you build willpower
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.820]   and think about how much I've built.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.540]   Now that you know about this, I didn't know about this.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.420]   But think about how much I've built.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.460]   Everything I've ever done in my life, I didn't want to do.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.620]   Everything, every day.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.380]   I'm a lazy piece of shit.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.060]   And I'm one of the hardest working people
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.900]   to ever step foot on this planet Earth.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.580]   And I'm saying that very proudly because I know what I do.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.700]   It's not cocky.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.740]   I'll tell you I'm stupid.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.480]   And I'll also tell you the exact opposite of what I've done.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.560]   It's the truth.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.720]   It is the truth.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.880]   So imagine how much I've developed in that time frame.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.640]   But it's the scary thing.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:16.040]   Why most people don't want to do that, build that willpower,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.600]   is because it is scary.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.000]   It unlocks a whole bunch of things about who you are
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.680]   and who you're not.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.040]   And a lot of people don't want to go down that journey
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.920]   to discover who they are and who they're not.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.800]   Because it's not a pretty journey.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.500]   I mean, I've gone down it-- it's not like I went down it once.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.060]   I go down it all the time.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.820]   And when you unlock that-- and you can't just turn it off.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.480]   People say, hey, how come you haven't retired yet?
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.100]   I built all this willpower.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.600]   Do you think it's going to let me just retire
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.380]   because my knees hurt?
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.520]   It's telling me every morning, I wake up like, man,
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.260]   my knees hurt, my legs hurt, my body hurts.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.160]   But you can still run.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.320]   So why aren't you running?
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.400]   If you can still run, there will be a time when you can't lace
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.840]   them up anymore, but you can still run.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   So I still run.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.080]   When the time comes I can't run, the body
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.760]   will say, you just can't run.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.240]   But if I can still do something, that willpower
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.680]   that I have created, it makes me do it every fucking day.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.020]   And that's what they don't get.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.800]   What builds a human being is you start with the small building
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.300]   blocks.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.960]   And before you know it, man, you become something that you--
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   it doesn't even make sense to most people
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.900]   because it's just who you are now.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:42.520]   That's why I can still run at 50 at 49 with broke down knees
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.280]   and broke down body, because my body knows you still can.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.600]   Therefore, I do.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.040]   Second you stop, the willpower is gone.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.060]   And that's beautiful.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.560]   I'm so glad you brought that to me,
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.680]   because I always wonder, what's this separation thing now?
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.640]   At 24 years old, I started building something
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.840]   that I didn't even know was going to be what it is now at 49.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.000]   And that's all it was, was just that.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.320]   This structure, anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.840]   has inputs and outputs from a bunch of places.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.960]   But you'll probably not be surprised to learn
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.840]   that it's strongly activated when we move our body, when
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.640]   we don't want to move our body.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.200]   I feel like it's like the David Goggins structure, right?
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:27.800]   It is.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.080]   And it also has strong connections
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.900]   to the dopamine reward pathway.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.520]   And everyone goes, yay, dopamine reward.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.980]   Everyone loves dopamine.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.720]   I'm partially responsible for people knowing
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.280]   a bit more about dopamine.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.600]   But dopamine is badly understood.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.400]   Everyone thinks dopamine, dopamine hits.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.960]   It's about reward.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.600]   It's about motivation and drive.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.320]   And there are pain inputs to the dopamine centers of the brain.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.480]   No one talks about that.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.320]   Everyone's like, oh, you want the chocolate,
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.400]   you know, chocolate, sex, cocaine.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.000]   Yeah, that's all true.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.360]   You release dopamine.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.080]   Pain releases dopamine.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.000]   The anterior mid-singulate cortex
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.480]   can trigger the release of dopamine in response
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.080]   to this thing that we're calling friction.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.360]   And that's a learned thing.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.380]   That's something that no animal or human being
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.640]   comes into the world learning.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.320]   We all are averse to pain and like pleasure, like sugar, fat,
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.960]   don't like hot surfaces.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.400]   But this is a structure that learns.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.720]   It has neuroplasticity, the ability
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.840]   to change throughout the entire lifespan.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.480]   And here's the part that I think, again,
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.520]   is just neuro nerd speak for what you already know
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.460]   and have done and exemplify, is that people say, oh,
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.200]   it has plasticity.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.040]   You can change it.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:40.620]   But guess what?
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.600]   It has plasticity in both directions.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.200]   It can grow, but just as easily as it can grow,
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.860]   it's like Silly Putty, it can shrink.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.800]   So it requires constant upkeep.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.680]   And that answer isn't one that people are going to like.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.440]   They're like, give me the energy drink, give me the supplement,
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.880]   give me the sauna protocol that's
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.060]   going to make my anterior mid-singulate cortex.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.280]   Someone out there right now is going,
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.560]   wait, if I took transcranial magnetic stimulation
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.440]   and I stimulate--
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.400]   yeah, you probably-- actually, they've done that.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.720]   They've stuck a little wire during neurosurgery
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.520]   into this structure.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.180]   This is actually discovered by a colleague of mine, Joe Parvizi.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:21.000]   Stimulate and the patients go, I feel like there's a storm
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.760]   coming.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.140]   And then they go, oh, is it scary?
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.200]   And they go, no, I want to go through it.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.520]   They come off the stimulation and people are like,
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.400]   this is the seat of what we're talking about.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.360]   Right, exactly.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.680]   And it learns.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.120]   So the fact that you've kept this brain structure,
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.160]   I'm convinced if we imaged your brain, it'd be large
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.280]   and it would be larger in two years, in a year.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.600]   But this is the no days off rationale because it can grow
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.400]   and it can shrink.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   I know.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.440]   What you're saying right now, I didn't know any of this.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.200]   And I never-- and I always talk to people,
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.520]   I wish I could just put this on paper.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.000]   And you're saying it in a way that people can understand.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.480]   I could never put into words on what I built and the power
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.760]   that is within all of us.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.400]   But you put it so in a scientific way.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.080]   Most people, for me, he's just crazy.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.800]   That's why I don't like talking about it, man.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.320]   I know I'm not crazy.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.640]   I know what I had to do to get where I had to go.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.240]   People look at it as crazy because they're
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.080]   people that just--
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.280]   if you can't imagine yourself doing something,
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.480]   if you can't imagine yourself doing something,
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.920]   the person that's doing it is crazy.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:42.200]   Because in your mind, the logic behind it, it doesn't compute.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.840]   Therefore, you have to give somebody a title.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.480]   And a title for me is usually, he's crazy, he's this, he's that.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.240]   No, no.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.720]   For some reason, me wanting to be somebody so fucking bad
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.920]   in my life, I created that.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.320]   And I've been trying to figure out years of my life
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.520]   trying to explain to people.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.120]   But even though you're explaining it now,
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.000]   this is the easy fucking part.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.720]   Them listening to this shit is the easy fucking part.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.440]   The part that why there will always be the ones of ones
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.720]   is because putting that practice,
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.960]   putting that into actual work, no, man, no, no.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.240]   That's where the demons come in.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.760]   That's where you're like, I don't want to be better.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.840]   I don't want to be better.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840]   If this is what it takes to be better,
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.240]   I don't want to be better.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.680]   So everybody's-- that's why there's a lot of average.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.080]   And it makes me so fucking mad.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.960]   Every day I walk this earth and I see average
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.640]   all over the fucking place.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.720]   And they want to ask me, how did you do it?
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.920]   I can't tell you how, because you're not going to fucking--
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.480]   you're not going to do it.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.160]   You're not going to do it.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.120]   You're going to continue being out, because every day you
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.760]   wake up, like you said, it's not like, get the coffee,
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.160]   make the pancakes, kiss the girl, kiss the kids.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.960]   You wake up right to work.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.720]   Immediately your mind is in action.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.400]   No one wants to do that.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.040]   No one.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.440]   And I don't blame them.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.160]   But don't be mad when you're laying there
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.400]   in your fucking bed and you're in the fucking hospital
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.480]   and you're 70, 80, 90 years old and you're thinking,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.200]   man, I feel like I didn't fucking do something.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.760]   Because you did.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.160]   You didn't do it.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.000]   You didn't do shit.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.520]   You may have lived a great life, man,
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.320]   but you're always going to feel empty inside.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.400]   I don't feel empty.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.960]   So call me what you want.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.240]   There's not one empty bone in my fucking body,
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.000]   because I have figured out that really the magic potion,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.040]   at least to my life, is very rewarding.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.720]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.760]   our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.240]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.920]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.520]   to help you better understand your body
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.320]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.080]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.920]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.160]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.000]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.080]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.480]   however, is that you get information back
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:22.360]   about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.400]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.600]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.520]   because they have a personalized platform
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.080]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.600]   metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.480]   but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.800]   that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.440]   supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.700]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.120]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.400]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.020]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.200]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.020]   - People like to talk about what they used to be able to do.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.120]   I hear this a lot.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.320]   You should have seen me in high school, I always laugh.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.160]   - Yep.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.080]   - Like, yeah, okay, got it.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.040]   And it's not just guys,
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.720]   you should see me working out in high school,
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.560]   I was super fit.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.720]   People will look back to a time
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.440]   where they felt like they were capable of something
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.960]   and now they're not.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.880]   And you kind of want to just grab them and go,
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.120]   wait, that was you then, it's you now.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.760]   But people tend to think about how the conditions
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.320]   that were around success must've been part of it.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.540]   And you can understand why, it's very rational.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.360]   I was in that situation, I was successful.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.320]   I'm in this situation, I'm not.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.200]   That was the past, this is the present,
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.360]   ergo, capable, right?
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.720]   You see how people get into these loops.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.440]   And as you mentioned, you spent the first 20 years
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.120]   of your life in extremely challenged circumstances.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.040]   And then you can see how people get to a point
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.320]   where everything feels hard.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.140]   Like when you're 300 pounds, I haven't never been 300 pounds,
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.800]   but I can't imagine it feels good to get up and move around.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.820]   - It's defeating.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:04.640]   - I got a friend, he's in excess of 300 pounds.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.800]   We've been trying on him for years, but no win.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   And he's got crazy psoriasis on the back of his calves.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.280]   And he actually smells bad sometimes
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.980]   'cause he can't wash as well as he would.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.040]   He's big, big.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.040]   - Right.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.200]   - And it pulls on my sympathy.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.020]   - Right.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.400]   - But life is very hard for him in getting worse.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.060]   He's a young guy with a lot of medical issues now
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.540]   for obvious reasons.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.820]   And so I think people like that think,
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.320]   well, it's already hard.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.880]   Why would I make it harder?
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.620]   Your message is a little different
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.260]   and you have the life experience.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.100]   - It's a lot different.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.300]   - You've been there.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.040]   So for me saying, oh yeah, lose weight.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.200]   I was a skinny guy who got to be a less skinny guy.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.280]   So I don't really have a foot to stand on.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.240]   What do you say to those people who are like,
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.760]   listen, I'm getting up in the morning is hard.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.000]   Trying to not dissolve into a puddle of my own tears
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.160]   and my own misery is hard.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.120]   - You know how people connect with my books so well?
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.960]   For some reason, God put me in almost every
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.620]   fucked up situation on the planet earth.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.760]   So when I talk to people, it's not sugar coated
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.120]   'cause I'm not saying it from I was 175 pounds
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:19.960]   my whole life.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.200]   I don't say much to those people.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   Maybe you're a piece of shit.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.040]   Maybe you want to be nobody.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.060]   Maybe you're happy exactly where you are in life
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.700]   'cause obviously you are.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.280]   Maybe you don't have the determination
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.820]   to be somebody better than who you are.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.260]   And if you want to live with that,
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.180]   I'll support you in that.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.520]   If you're good with being who you are,
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.360]   that every day you wake up and every day you smell like shit
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.000]   because you can't wash your body well
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.540]   and your skin's messed up because your health's so bad
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.300]   and you can't put your clothes on, right?
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.140]   You need help with that.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.140]   You need help like when I was 13,
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.740]   I need help wiping my ass.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.900]   That makes you feel good?
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.340]   Nothing I can say to you.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.920]   If every day you wake up with this,
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.260]   see people are haunted,
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.460]   but they obviously like horror films
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.120]   'cause they keep watching the same fucking movie.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.980]   I don't like horror films.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.780]   A lot of people like horror films,
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.660]   so I don't say much to them.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.940]   I say exactly what I said to you right there
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.240]   because I was once you.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.920]   I didn't like horror films, so I changed it.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.500]   Some people are just, they become, like you said,
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.780]   it gets real small when you're lazy and you're fat.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:38.140]   Your will, their will is so small
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:41.260]   that they don't have any and you can't give it to them.
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.540]   There has to be something.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.940]   This is what I'm talking about now
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.440]   because this isn't a hack.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.640]   This has to be in you.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.580]   Something in you has to wake up.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.100]   And usually the only person that can wake it up is you.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.640]   Sometimes you can read a David Goggins book
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.020]   because I was all this shit
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.940]   and then a lot more are fucked up.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:05.840]   But if you don't have a little flame,
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.080]   you know, just barely, you're done.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.320]   I can't, I can't light it for you.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.040]   And that's the harsh reality of this life
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.040]   that I want to get across so fucking bad.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.820]   You can watch me, you can watch you,
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.600]   you can watch fucking Rogan and Cameron Haynes,
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.640]   all these motherfuckers.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.520]   You can go to Tony Robinson's fucking bullshit,
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.380]   all this shit, and do all this shit.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:32.160]   If you, you could keep going back
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.600]   and keep spending money and spending money
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.640]   and spending money with no results.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.760]   You can wonder, wow, maybe let me go try out David Goggins.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.840]   He ain't gonna fucking help you.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:47.840]   You have to explore, examine the insides of yourself.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.200]   And what do you really want out of life?
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.300]   Your friend and a lot of people out here
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.160]   just don't fucking want it.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.000]   So guess what?
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.020]   Have fun with your life.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:03.440]   Go from three to 350 to 400 to 450 to 500
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.020]   because you don't want it.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.600]   And that's the harsh reality.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   I can't give you shit.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.160]   You can't give them shit.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.560]   I can give you ideas.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.860]   But in the day, when I was losing the weight,
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:23.040]   I had to miserably wake up every morning in the cold
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.700]   'cause it was Indiana, November when it started.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.160]   I was miserable.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.260]   This is your new life.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.440]   Take it or leave it.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.320]   There's no happiness about it.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.080]   There's no peace behind it.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.120]   It sucks.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.200]   It just fucking sucks.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.240]   And that's the one thing if I could teach anybody anything,
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.440]   it just fucking sucks.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.600]   And it's gonna continue to suck.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.000]   And then one day you'll get to a special part in your life
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.940]   that it might get a little bit better.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.820]   But to lose the weight you have to lose, my friend,
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.640]   sorry, it's gonna suck every fucking day.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.920]   'Cause then when you're 300 pounds,
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.640]   you're gonna go out to lose weight,
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.680]   you'll probably get injured.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.320]   So then you gotta work on the injury
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.560]   and then you get even more depressed.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.960]   This is what I went through.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.880]   And then you're hungry 'cause now you're depressed.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.120]   It's just a vicious cycle.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.400]   And if you're not strong mentally
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.480]   and you have no willpower,
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.840]   you're gonna continue falling back in this hole
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.280]   versus a man that sits back and goes,
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.800]   "All right, motherfucker."
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.360]   This is why I cuss 'cause this is what is in me.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.440]   This is what it took for me to be me.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.280]   Sorry.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.560]   It didn't take, "Hey, okay, we're gonna do this today."
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.280]   No, this fucking really sucks.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.040]   This is real, dude.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.460]   This is real.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.040]   And every day I'm set back, I'm set back,
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.680]   I'm set back, I'm set back.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.800]   So this is what I would tell your boy.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.180]   This is exactly what I tell him.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.600]   Every day you wake up, you're gonna probably be set back
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.800]   for the first four weeks before you lose
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.160]   to significant weight because of the mind's
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.820]   gonna be fucking with you the whole time.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.080]   There's no dopamine.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.600]   There's no dopamine in there at 300 pounds.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600]   You got nothing.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.860]   Your hormones are shot.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.860]   You have to envision something
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.840]   that is more powerful than you.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:16.280]   Something has to get you out of bed
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.720]   and you have to create it.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.260]   It has to be false 'cause you're not it.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.420]   You're a fat piece of shit and that's the reality of it.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   So you have to create a false reality to live in that
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.000]   just to get to work on yourself.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.900]   That's the reality.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.700]   - Hello.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.200]   He'll see this and he'll appreciate that message.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.600]   We'll see what he does.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.440]   - We'll see.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.240]   - So far last 13 years, it's been no movement,
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:50.240]   but I've had other friends who were drug and alcohol addicts
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.140]   who quit after one conversation, never went back.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:53.980]   - That's awesome.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.740]   That means they want it.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.460]   - Yeah, just one guy, I won't out him,
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.780]   but walked up to me at a party in 2019,
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.660]   July 4th party and said, "I'm a pile."
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.880]   And I go, "What?" And he goes, "I'm a pile.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.580]   "Look at me, I'm 60 pounds overweight."
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:08.420]   I go, "Do you drink?"
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.240]   He goes, "Every day."
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.080]   I go, "How much?"
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.420]   He goes, "A case."
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.020]   He goes, "I smoke a lot of weed."
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.020]   But he's successful in other areas of his life.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.120]   So I said, "Well, here's what I know.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.420]   "Quit alcohol and weed for you.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.560]   "I'm not telling people what to do.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.800]   "Don't eat until 2 p.m.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.460]   "Get on an exercise bike and pedal in the morning
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.140]   "like someone's chasing you with a poison dart
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.580]   "til you want to puke."
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.040]   And I was kind of half joking.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.260]   And then two months later, he was like,
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.180]   "I haven't had a drink, I lost 30 pounds."
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.700]   He lost that 60 pounds, he never went back.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.900]   Now he's super fit.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.740]   It's amazing.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.620]   So some people flip the switch.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.900]   He is very self-critical by nature.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:51.720]   - That's what flips the switch.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.140]   - He's super self-critical.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.780]   - Yep, that's what flips the switch.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.300]   Think about it, man.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.320]   We know what to do.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.780]   We don't need Angie Huberman to tell us what to do.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.860]   We know what to do.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:04.920]   Every one of us.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.220]   That's why he flipped it so fast.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.260]   'Cause he knew what to do.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:12.660]   He didn't go by your exact protocol.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.420]   He didn't go by the exact...
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.840]   No, he knew exactly what to do.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.540]   And you just saying some shit to him
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.740]   and woke something up, he knew what to do.
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:29.040]   And that's the thing that people need to get that.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.660]   You know what to do, why aren't you doing it?
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.140]   And I'm talking about myself now.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.500]   Those modes of just kind of passive consumption,
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.900]   they're so easy to wash over us.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.100]   I used to have this thing and I'm fighting this now
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.620]   'cause I knew we were gonna have this conversation today
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.420]   where I like to start things on the hour or the half hour.
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:50.900]   Worst practice in the world for me.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.260]   Because if I miss that half hour,
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.740]   I'm like, ah, it's 12.33.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.180]   I'll start at 12.45.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.140]   - Right.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.300]   - Ah, it's 12.45.
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.380]   I'll start at one.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.540]   I just lost time.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.220]   And then, so this is so stupid, right?
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:07.060]   And the other day I was like,
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.340]   "Man, I gotta tell David about this."
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.960]   'Cause my new thing is I start no matter what time it is.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.060]   If I wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.580]   I got a friend, he paints in the middle of the night.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.620]   I'm like, "You're an insomniac."
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.440]   He's like, "I don't know, I just do it."
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.980]   Then sometimes he goes back to sleep, sometimes he doesn't.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.460]   Everyone's got their thing, but I thought about this.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.920]   I'm like, "No more am I gonna say I'm starting at one
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.500]   'cause I know me."
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.780]   If I miss the one o'clock, ding,
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.420]   and then my pen's not hitting the paper,
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.460]   I'm not typing on the keyboard, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.300]   - Right.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.300]   - That's a self-admitted weakness.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.980]   - I love it, man.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.480]   I had that for a lot of years.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.980]   I know I'm gonna do it.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:47.980]   That's the haunting part, is that it's going to happen.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.300]   It has to happen.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.600]   And that's a fact.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.100]   Like, there's no get out of jail free card, bro.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.020]   None.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.780]   Like, that is a life that I don't know.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.780]   I don't have that ability, or I have the ability,
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:10.060]   I don't have the, I'm not good enough, smart enough.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:15.340]   I'm not talented enough to do that.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.500]   Some people are.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.940]   Some people can start at one.
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:22.220]   Some people don't have to start at all.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:25.660]   If you lack talent, you can't sit back and say,
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.820]   "I'll start in half an hour."
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.620]   I can't do that.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.980]   I gotta start now.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:36.060]   And after I get back from starting, I gotta start again.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.380]   And then when I get done with that run
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.220]   or that study session, if it wasn't good enough,
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.260]   I gotta go back again.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:45.500]   'Cause repetition is what taught me everything.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.420]   So you can honestly outwork anything.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:53.360]   But it's that you obviously are a very talented man.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.100]   - Well, I have worked hard at certain things
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.660]   and built up some things that I've been good at
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:00.620]   most of my life.
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.580]   - You're amazing.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.540]   - Gathering, organizing and disseminating information,
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.840]   something I've been doing since I was a little kid.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.440]   I used to give lectures at school on Monday
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.380]   about stuff I learned over the weekend.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:10.220]   - See, check that out.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.300]   - But they took me to a psychiatrist.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.140]   We're the same age.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.100]   Back then, if we got sent to a psychiatrist,
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.220]   people thought you were crazy.
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:17.060]   - I wasn't one.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.220]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.680]   Exactly, so I remember feeling like a freak.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.540]   I also, I didn't have a stutter, but I had a grunting tic.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.220]   It comes back when I'm tired.
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.180]   And the only thing that helped that was hitting my head
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.740]   on something, shaking my head,
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.820]   which is why skateboarding was good.
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.660]   'Cause I'd slam and I'd feel like, oh, I feel good.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:37.100]   That's not healthy.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.220]   You know, that's not good.
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.540]   Or just work, work is what gets it out.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:44.240]   It's like a RPM or high, you know?
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.700]   Anyway, that's me.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:48.000]   But yeah, I think certain things over time,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.100]   I feel like talent or gifts or whatever you want to call
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.220]   them, but there are many things that are exceedingly
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.540]   difficult for me.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:55.980]   And I have learned from your example.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:59.100]   I know that you are very, both humble and very clear
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.900]   that like you don't have, you say I don't,
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.640]   you're not going to get it by examining you.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.340]   But I think the way you're sharing today
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.480]   and the way you shared on other podcasts before,
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.760]   there are pieces that really help people feel
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.180]   into the process of what you're talking about today.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.820]   We're elaborating on it, I think a lot, you know,
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.540]   this notion of being haunted in the stick.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.460]   I mean, of course, of course, now it makes so much sense
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.860]   why you don't want to talk about sleep or rest or recovery.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.220]   'Cause that's, sure that's important.
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.580]   I've heard you say, yes, you sleep.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:32.420]   Yes, you eat.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.240]   Yes, you hydrate.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.580]   Yes, you, you will stretch your psoas or whatever,
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.940]   but it's funny how that becomes the viral message.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:38.980]   - That's why I said, fuck that today.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.600]   - But that's not the unique,
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.500]   that's not the unique message that you carry.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.140]   Like anyone can talk about that.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.020]   So do I have that right?
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.620]   That you're acknowledging sleep is important,
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.820]   recovery is important,
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.820]   but that's not what you're about.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.780]   - You have to forego something.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:59.780]   Yes, ice baths, saunas, sleep, nutrition,
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.660]   all this shit's so fucking important, dude.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:06.020]   I don't have time for some of it.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.820]   To get, to extract what I had to extract,
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.300]   something I had to give.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.980]   Like you talk about you when you were younger,
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.700]   you would, you would give these speeches and stuff.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:17.620]   The same age you were giving speeches,
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.560]   I was trying to figure out how to say the, without stuttering.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.740]   And I realized as I got older,
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.540]   that all these things are important.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.740]   But for me to stop stuttering,
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.340]   I gotta build fucking confidence.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:36.740]   And speech therapy didn't help that, nothing helped that.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.420]   I have to forego a lot of shit,
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:43.220]   to be as fucked up as I am, to build confidence.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.260]   For me to stand in the fucking room of 10,000,
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:49.380]   of one person and not be like, oh, put my head down.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:54.380]   Let me look around, let me read these paragraphs first.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.180]   And then before I read the paragraphs,
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.020]   'cause they're calling me next,
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.140]   let me just leave the room kind of with stutter.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.580]   That's a miserable life.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:05.420]   And that's one of many things I did, besides lying,
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.980]   besides being insecure, besides being immature,
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.980]   besides being fat,
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.780]   besides being one of the only black kids in my school.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:15.940]   There's a lot of things I had to overcome to gain confidence.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:21.340]   And in doing so, a lot of that had to go, a lot of it.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.460]   So I became the guy that became once again misunderstood.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.580]   You only sleep four hours a day, two hours a day.
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.860]   Sometimes you don't sleep at all.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.420]   Like, what's this and what's this and what's this?
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.740]   I know it's all important.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:37.040]   I can't, something's gotta go.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.860]   For me to get confidence,
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:40.480]   'cause confidence is the building block
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.000]   of where I'm trying to go,
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.300]   for me to gain confidence in myself,
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.800]   this fucked up kid has got to do a lot of fucked up shit
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.680]   to gain confidence.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:51.100]   And along the way, the stutter went away
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.960]   and I gained confidence.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.140]   And now my life is a little bit more,
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.300]   there is no balance.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.140]   There's no balance.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:04.720]   It's a little bit more what it should be
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.920]   for a lot of people, but there'll never be balance,
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.340]   'cause confidence is something that you constantly,
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.660]   confidence and belief, you're building every day.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.940]   And so something's gotta give.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.940]   And I'm willing to forego a lot of things to have that,
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.060]   'cause I know that is,
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.740]   if you wanna give somebody kryptonite,
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:25.700]   take that shit away from me.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.580]   So yeah, I don't sleep sometimes
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.300]   and sometimes I don't eat the right way.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.460]   Sometimes I don't do this and do that and whatever, man.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.040]   But you put me in a room with 10,000 people
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.360]   anytime of the day and I walk in there thinking,
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.460]   I'm the best motherfucker in here,
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.500]   'cause I know what it took to be on this stage.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.000]   A lot of people will not do that.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.340]   So that's what it takes.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:47.420]   - There's a question I've been wanting to ask you
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.020]   since we started.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.420]   And I thought about coming in here
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.520]   and I've been thinking about in the weeks ahead of this,
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.780]   and I'm gonna just come clean and say,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.040]   I don't exactly know how to ask the question.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.780]   - Just ask it.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.940]   - So it's about relationships.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.260]   - Oh, do it, man.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.900]   - So I know in myself
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.180]   that my discipline is much higher when it's just me,
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.060]   but that's because I had certain things early on,
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.340]   but then I was a terrible student,
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.180]   barely finished high school.
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.700]   But then when I got serious, I got serious,
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:20.700]   but I did that by staying away from everybody.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:25.540]   And anyone who's ever had a relationship of any kind,
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.380]   but in particular, romantic relationships knows that yes,
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:31.020]   you can derive tremendous support from those.
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.540]   Like, you got this, baby, you can go in.
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.260]   You're like, yeah, I got this.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:35.460]   She said, I got this.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.280]   Feels great to finish something and share with someone,
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.020]   share a meal, get the hug.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:43.540]   But there's another side to all of that
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.460]   that I'd like to learn more about from you,
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.940]   which is there's a warm body next to you
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.660]   in bed in the morning.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.620]   You don't wanna get up.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.740]   They also have needs.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.100]   You've got your mission that people
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.180]   sometimes need things from us,
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:01.640]   but also oftentimes the people that love us most,
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:04.440]   that truly love us and that wanna support us,
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.320]   don't understand this thing.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.620]   And they're the first people to tell us like,
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.580]   listen, take a day off.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.980]   And then this whole cycle, at least in my head goes off,
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:17.580]   like you just want a vacation.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.780]   And then it's almost like a paranoia.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.500]   I'm not saying anything nice about myself right now.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.500]   Former girlfriends are gonna be like, yeah.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.880]   You know, they remember.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.740]   And so support of people close to you is critical.
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.240]   This could be friends, could be romantic partners, whatever.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.780]   But they're also, the knife cuts both ways.
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.620]   It can be the thing that can really undermine
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.640]   this thing that you're talking about,
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.340]   because the people that care about us
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.100]   also wanna see us comfortable.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:43.940]   They wanna see us happy.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.340]   They wanna see us peaceful.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:47.500]   They wanna see us wake up from a great night's sleep
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.780]   and they want things too.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:52.660]   So how do you untangle that whole bit?
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.540]   - Well, it's funny, man.
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:55.720]   I'm unbalanced, but I'm mostly unbalanced
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.540]   towards the family side.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.060]   So you don't get about me.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.020]   I'll start being unbalanced.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:01.700]   I get all my stuff in.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.720]   But what I do is I make sure that my family
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.620]   has everything they need.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.420]   Everything they need.
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.900]   Those who wanna be part of my family.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:11.740]   Some don't.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.320]   Some family members don't wanna be part of David Goggins.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.800]   I get it, I got it.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.180]   That's life.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.820]   Those who are part of my family,
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:21.920]   I give them everything they need
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.680]   so they can leave me the fuck alone.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.620]   I make sure you're happy as fuck,
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.120]   'cause I gotta go to work.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:31.020]   And I don't mean smoke jumping.
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.840]   I don't mean running.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:33.920]   I mean all of it.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.500]   It takes every, I can't have you in my fucking shit.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:39.780]   Can't.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:41.600]   So I know for me to have a family,
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.060]   I gotta make sure that you realize
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:44.940]   I'm gonna give you everything you need
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.060]   so when you start bitching at me,
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.760]   I'm gonna say, "Look, hang on.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.360]   "I dedicated my life to give you everything you need.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.980]   "I need this time right here."
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.500]   For me to be the best I can be
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:58.260]   because this journey started without anybody.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.140]   And I make sure everybody knows that because of my life.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.780]   I've been left, think about it.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:08.540]   I was left alone at a young age to figure this shit out.
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:12.500]   I figured it out for myself.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.060]   It had been very successful for myself.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:18.060]   No one's gonna come in here and fuck with my shit.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.580]   That's why I make sure I will take care
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.420]   of whatever you need.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.540]   Whatever you need from me, you got it.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.260]   Money, house, my love, my support.
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.540]   I'm gonna give you everything you need.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:31.580]   That said, I do it the highest level possible.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.460]   And I'm saying it with Jennifer in the next room.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.260]   So please come in and say something if it's wrong,
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.360]   Jennifer, I don't give a fuck.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.060]   Say what you gotta say.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.840]   So then when it's time for me to go to work,
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.860]   I expect you to do the same for me
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:48.380]   'cause it takes every bit of me to do what I have to do.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:52.500]   So I make sure that I'm very unbalanced for my family
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:56.600]   so I can be exactly that unbalanced for myself.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.360]   And that's how I do it.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.020]   I let people know right up front,
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:05.900]   I'm not what you want in a man.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.100]   I guarantee that.
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.040]   There's gonna be a lot of late nights,
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.620]   a lot of early mornings, a lot of times,
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.700]   where I gotta be by myself thinking about the process
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.900]   that is next in my mind.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.980]   I can't have aggravation, can't have this, can't have that.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.820]   There's a lot of things, but I let them know up front.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.980]   I'm very vocal about that.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.560]   Sometimes relationships work for me.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.540]   Sometimes they didn't, but that's who I am.
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.100]   One thing I did wrong in my life
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.900]   was I tried for so many years to please people.
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:39.140]   And I did it at the expense of myself.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:42.620]   I was leaving a lot in the tank.
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:44.940]   And when you do that, you stop living.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:49.260]   But the person in your life is happy as fuck
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.060]   'cause you're giving them everything they want.
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:54.900]   They have, their life is full, but you feel empty.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.480]   And that's not a relationship to me.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:02.340]   So for me, it's important that you know exactly who I am
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:05.520]   because this is what life made.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.880]   And I'm not trying to change it
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.400]   because I just figured it out.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.920]   So I'm not trying to compromise David Goggins.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.200]   I will never, ever compromise David Goggins.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.680]   That doesn't mean I won't give you what you need
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.560]   and what you want and what you desire.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.880]   But I don't need money.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.900]   I don't need fame.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.300]   I don't need shit.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.460]   So I give it all away.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.840]   What I do need is to make sure that that willpower
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.760]   is worked on every fucking day and every night
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.960]   for the rest of my life.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.640]   'Cause that's the one thing that's gonna keep me
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.740]   feeding you, keeping you where you need to be.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.860]   'Cause once that willpower is gone,
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:48.020]   300 pound David Goggins, he may not look like it,
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.480]   but I will walk around with it.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.380]   So the things that are important to you in life,
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:57.500]   you must do always, or you're nobody.
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.440]   And that's how I handle relationships.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.720]   - Amen to that.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.920]   Something I could personally work on
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.200]   is that upfront clear communication.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.740]   'Cause it resonates that feeling of,
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.920]   like there's something inside that's not getting worked out
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.780]   that when I'm on my own, it's a lot easier.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:17.260]   But then of course, wanting relationships and family.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.460]   I think that's a healthy part of being human too.
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:20.780]   Obviously you've worked it out.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.540]   So I appreciate you sharing that.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.480]   I don't think I've ever heard you
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.380]   talk about it that way before. - People are scared of that.
[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:28.660]   People are scared of that conversation with their wife,
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:31.140]   husband, girlfriend, boyfriend.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.540]   But why are you scared of it?
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.880]   Why are you scared to tell a motherfucker,
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.860]   your wife, your husband, who you are?
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:42.620]   Who you are, exactly who you are.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.700]   And that was a problem I had.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.500]   That's a problem that a lot of us have in life.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.100]   No one knows who you really are.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.740]   No one knew who I really was.
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:55.420]   I went to a school where there were a lot of black kids.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:58.420]   A lot of black kids didn't want to be in special ops.
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.860]   I never talked about special ops with black kids.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:02.980]   Why?
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:06.100]   I was wondering what, I'm not gonna fit in.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.700]   That's not what they do.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.460]   A lot of black kids don't do that kind of shit.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.820]   So whatever I wanted to do,
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.220]   no one really knew the real me growing up.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.180]   Because I never want anybody to know the real me.
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:19.880]   I was always afraid of what you might say
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.060]   or how you're gonna feel or whatever.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.180]   You got feelings.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:27.060]   You have a life that you have to live.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.040]   So it's important that whatever's on your mind,
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:30.940]   you let that person know.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.420]   Therefore, you're giving them the option
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.860]   to be with you or not.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.260]   This is who I am.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.700]   If you don't like it, that's good, man.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.880]   I got it.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.020]   But this is David Goggins.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.540]   So that honest conversation is very important, man.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:46.080]   So everybody knows where they stand.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.220]   That person may not be for you.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.160]   That's all good.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.420]   - This world could use a lot more of that upfront,
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.940]   completely honest conversation.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.720]   I feel like so much of the world's problems
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.380]   are because everyone's dancing around the issues.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.220]   - Thanks a lot.
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.020]   - Recently in the news, seeing people losing their job
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.380]   'cause they won't say something publicly.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.580]   You can tell they kind of want it.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:06.260]   It's like, people just,
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.260]   I think deep down really crave the direct message.
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.100]   Like, what are you about?
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:10.920]   What are you not about?
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:14.580]   But I think now everyone's afraid of getting canceled.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.180]   It's a big deal, right?
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.340]   Getting canceled that people think,
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.340]   oh, I can't work if I am who I am
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:23.940]   or if I'm not pretending to be somebody else,
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:28.680]   then silence is considered agreement.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:30.940]   There's all sorts of complicated stuff.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:33.520]   And I do feel for the generation coming up
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.620]   'cause we didn't have social media and all of that,
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.140]   that getting just walled off from that,
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:41.100]   there's a real benefit from just not paying attention.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.860]   - People love to lie.
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:44.120]   People love to lie.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.180]   I thought I was the only person growing up,
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:48.360]   I thought I was the only person that lied
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.260]   'cause I live in the bubble.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:53.260]   And people love to lie about who they're not.
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:55.700]   They love to lie about who they're not, dude.
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.180]   And that's, for me, the reason why I'm so vulnerable
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.780]   and I'm so real and honest,
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.560]   find somebody to come out and tell me
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.340]   I'm lying about my fucking life.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:10.820]   And for me to come where I came from
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.700]   and have the resume I have now,
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.900]   you know the confidence you get?
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:18.680]   How, I don't care who, you gonna judge me?
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.520]   You gonna judge me?
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.780]   What have you done in your life?
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:25.780]   So me being so honest and so upfront and so truthful,
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:30.780]   that came with me finally figuring out who I was,
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.740]   but also conquering David Goggins,
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:35.620]   the demons of David Goggins.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:38.260]   Therefore, now you're just an open book.
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:39.580]   You look at somebody looking right in the eye,
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.160]   tell them exactly who the fuck you are.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.380]   You walk away.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.780]   I'm good, bro, 'cause I know exactly
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.740]   what this journey took to get here.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.860]   And that gives you a fire and a passion
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.660]   that people can call you nigger,
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:53.860]   they can call you if you're a lesbian or gay or bisexual.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.540]   Call you whatever the fuck you want.
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.340]   If you put yourself in the fire
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.660]   and you come out every fucking day like this,
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.260]   brush it off, not scared to go back in there again,
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.480]   come on, man, your truth is real.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.940]   You come out every day, man,
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:11.220]   with a way of talking to people that people don't have
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:13.400]   'cause there's no truth behind them.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.040]   And the truth is a starting line.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.160]   When you sit in an ugly mirror and say,
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.400]   "I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,"
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.140]   you finally started your life.
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:23.720]   Maybe 40 years old, maybe 40 years old,
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.140]   five, six kids, wife.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.180]   The second you look in that mirror and you say,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:31.220]   "I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,"
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.820]   well, basically, "I'm not this, I'm not this, I'm not this,
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.040]   "I can't do this, I can't do this,
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.580]   "I'm all these insecurities," your life finally started.
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.020]   And once you start that life, man,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.100]   the truth comes out big time 'cause you don't wanna care.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:44.940]   So that's the problem.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.740]   Most people just don't wanna have that conversation
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.260]   to the point where they can go on stage
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.760]   with a million people and say,
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:57.080]   "I'm all this and have a good day, see you."
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.920]   It's empowering, it's very empowering.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.180]   - I feel like the way we're educated in school,
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.300]   but also outside of school,
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.280]   is we're trained as human beings, these young brains,
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.460]   to try and figure out how to get positive feedback
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.580]   from other people.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.500]   It's like we're like little dogs.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.240]   You have a bulldog, I had a bulldog,
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.580]   saw the picture of your bulldog, she's great.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.420]   - Charlie dog.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.620]   - They're an amazing species.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:22.460]   - They are.
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.100]   - I think of them, economy of effort or amazing breed,
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.560]   excuse me, they're an amazing breed, economy of effort.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.380]   They don't do anything unless it's necessary.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.940]   It's kind of the exact opposite
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.780]   of everything we're talking about.
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:36.500]   It's kind of interesting and they're kind of hedonist.
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.540]   Now it is true that they'll die to protect you.
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.660]   And it's an instinct, I saw that with Costello,
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.500]   I'm sure that's-
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:44.320]   - Saw it with Charlie.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.600]   - Yeah, it's an instinct.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.720]   But if they're not in that position,
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.400]   if there's no need to exert effort-
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.240]   - They're resting.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.780]   - Yeah, so your bulldog's resting for you.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.620]   - Yes.
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:55.440]   - Got it.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.280]   - Exactly.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.120]   - So you don't need to rest 'cause-
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.380]   - Active recovery Charlie.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.780]   - Perfect, perfect.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.140]   That's gonna be your answer from now on.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:01.980]   - Active recovery Charlie.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:02.800]   - Does he sleep, does he rest?
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.900]   No, he somehow worked it out
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:05.140]   so his bulldog does it for him.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:09.340]   - Right, but we're sort of indoctrinated
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:12.520]   into this way of being from a time that we're young
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:15.180]   where of course praise feels good, right?
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.840]   Someone tells you, "Hey, I liked that shirt
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.540]   or good job today or nicely done."
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.740]   For me, 'cause I like growing up
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.780]   in a big pack of friends growing up
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.580]   and I was never the greatest athlete,
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.500]   wasn't terrible, wasn't great, et cetera,
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:31.180]   like a fist bump or like a feeling crude up.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.660]   And you're just like, "Yeah."
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:34.380]   But you've talked about this before
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.100]   in reference to the SEAL teams.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.580]   We both know a lot of people in that community
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.460]   and the team's component is a big part of it
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.220]   for a lot of people.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:42.700]   And it's a wonderful thing.
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:43.540]   - Right.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:48.060]   - But there's a danger to that dopamine hit
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.640]   for lack of a better way to put it
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:54.640]   from what we only derive when it's coming from outside.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.320]   You're talking about being able to either say good job,
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:03.260]   but also like just look to one's own personal history
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.140]   and say, "I've done hard things
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.800]   and I can do it again and again
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.820]   'cause I do it again and again and again."
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.060]   You're talking about parenting yourself,
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:17.020]   inspiring yourself, scaring yourself,
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.860]   all of that from the inside.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:21.380]   So very different than the way we're raised,
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:24.200]   which is to figure out how to get the biscuit.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.040]   - It's funny, man.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.160]   People wanna know how I'm always motivated.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:30.660]   It's the unseen work,
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:32.340]   which you just said is a true statement.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:35.840]   Those are false dopamine hits that people are giving you, man.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:38.580]   There's no belief in that.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.140]   These are teamwork dopamine.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:43.220]   Like I'm out running at two o'clock in the morning,
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:45.220]   one o'clock in the morning, in the gym,
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:47.400]   long sessions by myself.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.540]   That's real.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:53.260]   How am I able to just extract dopamine,
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.340]   the good dopamine whenever I want?
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:41:00.340]   Man, I've trained 99% of my life alone.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:03.100]   No one pat me on the back.
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.840]   I did all of the work alone.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:12.180]   And while I'm still hard on myself, I know what I did.
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.060]   So whenever times get bad for people,
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.420]   all this, "Who's your carry the boats?"
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.780]   That's real.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:20.660]   I hate that people know me for that guy
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:23.340]   'cause that guy is not every fucking day.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:26.140]   Like when they see me, they want that energy.
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:28.220]   That's not me every day.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.260]   I can extract it immediately when I need to
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:32.860]   because when you train alone
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.820]   and I lived alone for so many years in this misery
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:38.280]   and you're able to get out by yourself,
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.800]   I can take myself to such a level of real,
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.780]   real passion and purpose.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:47.020]   And like the feeling I get is something
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.640]   I can't even explain by myself.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.440]   I don't need anyone.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.100]   That's why people come to me to motivate them.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.860]   No one can motivate me.
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:58.980]   I have a resume full of fucking motivation
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:02.140]   that whenever I'm down, I'm like, "Oh, hang on motherfucker.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:05.140]   Oh, you know, you know the truth.
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:05.980]   You know the truth.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:08.060]   You know the darkness of the fucking dungeons
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.100]   and the fucking demons that fly.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:13.300]   And then from there, it's like, "Okay, you were there.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.140]   You know this.
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.600]   There was no one there to pick up the rucksack,
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:19.060]   to pick up the boat, to pick up the log, to go in there.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.500]   It was you.
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:21.340]   It was you.
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:23.480]   There was no pat on the fucking back at 300,
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.900]   at 275, at 250, at 220.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:28.360]   No, that was you.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.380]   So those things that come out of me,
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:33.220]   that extract from me in the darkness,
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:34.900]   people are looking for that pat on the back.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:35.740]   Where is it?
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.780]   "Oh, I don't need it."
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:43.700]   Because what I've done is in the fucking unseen work,
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:46.400]   I built Frankenstein.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.760]   So whenever shit gets nasty,
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:54.140]   David Goggins goes, "You had nobody anyway, motherfucker."
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.300]   So see how I'm talking to myself right now?
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.180]   That's me.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.360]   That shit fires me the fuck up.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.180]   That shit makes me fucking nuts.
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:03.180]   You had nobody anyway, motherfucker.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.680]   Look around you.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.360]   There was no fucking team.
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.840]   It was you.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.400]   There was no weight loss program
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:12.340]   or mom and dad waking you up saying, "You can do it.
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:13.460]   You can be better."
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:14.820]   Trying to build belief.
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.980]   You built belief when you had nothing.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:20.320]   Rock bottom.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.160]   You did that.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.460]   So as times get hard for me,
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.780]   the truth comes out and my truth is powerful as fuck.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:31.360]   It's real.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.980]   It's tangible.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:33.820]   I feel it.
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.380]   It comes out of my brain as I speak about it.
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:41.380]   I'm reliving every single dark moment of my life to be here.
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:46.860]   So that is what people don't get.
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:50.320]   That is what motivates David Goggins is the unseen work,
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.540]   but everybody needs that pat on the back.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.040]   They need that training partner.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.740]   They need that accountability coach.
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.400]   I don't hear that shit and neither do they,
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.400]   but it's what we've trained ourselves
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.280]   to believe that we need.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.560]   - It's almost like there's this pill on the shelf.
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.820]   I'm speaking in analogy.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.080]   And we take it and we get jazzed up.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:13.560]   We're like, "Yeah."
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.160]   But there's this other medicine cabinet behind there
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.000]   and it's in us.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.400]   You're saying the real medicine cabinet is inside.
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.240]   - Oh yes.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.080]   When you continue to overcome,
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.960]   and I had so many obstacles to overcome.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.420]   So it's actually a benefit to me,
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:29.800]   but the benefit is not like a benefit like that.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.120]   You have to have the courage and the patience
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.580]   to overcome and overcome.
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:38.220]   Before you know it, man, you have a whole medicine cabinet,
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.420]   but there's no medicine in the motherfucker.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:42.480]   There's no pre-workout.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.720]   I don't take none of that shit.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.120]   All I gotta do is flip my brain,
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:51.840]   put my finger in there and say, "Okay, that's a good one."
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:52.940]   That's all I gotta do, man.
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:54.340]   I got the Rolodex of just like,
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:55.740]   "Go fuck yourself, Goggins."
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:58.420]   And, "Oh, but you won.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:44:59.980]   Let's do that one today."
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:02.460]   There's nothing I need.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.300]   And this is the thing that people don't get
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:05.960]   about David Goggins.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.500]   I can't teach it in a one-minute video.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:15.480]   We all have this ability to have our own medicine cabinet.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.580]   But unless you go in there and put the medicine in there,
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:23.580]   it's always going to be fucking empty, man.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.620]   You're always going to need the pre-workout.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.640]   You're always going to need the, "I don't drink coffee.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:29.100]   I don't do, I don't do none of that.
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:33.240]   I don't need, I can run for 70 hours and I had before."
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.940]   No caffeine.
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:40.780]   I got all this wonderful shit that I overcame on my own
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:43.220]   by myself in the darkness.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:45.160]   That, man, when it's cold, I'm hot.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:51.960]   When it's hot, I can feed myself all the time.
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.460]   That's why when people say, "Man,
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.160]   why aren't you missing anything?"
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.160]   I can't explain it to you, man.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.040]   Can't explain it to you.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.580]   You'll never understand.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:03.680]   That's why I don't do all these podcasts, dude.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.060]   I love you, man.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:10.120]   That's why you, my first book, you did a blur for me.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.220]   That's why I'm here.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.720]   I love what you're doing for people, man.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.260]   But I can't explain this.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:16.260]   I can't.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:19.260]   I can't explain this because people don't want to do this.
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:20.100]   They don't want to do this, man.
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.360]   I don't know, man.
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.240]   I get jazzed up even talking about it, man,
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.440]   because so many people think my life is just so,
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.480]   oh God, his life is horrible.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.320]   Don't follow him.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.140]   He's crazy.
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:31.980]   Really?
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.660]   - Well, there are a good number of people, I would say,
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:36.560]   and that's an understatement, that actually do.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.720]   I think what I'm hearing today,
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.160]   and it's really sinking in,
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.320]   is that a great many people either partially
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.320]   or completely misunderstand you.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:46.760]   - Yes, big time.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.720]   - I'll put myself in the partially category.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:49.560]   - Big time.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.560]   - Because I thought it was about just forward center of mass
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.640]   carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, but it's the stick.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:46:59.480]   - It's the stick.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.300]   - And it's being haunted.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:02.800]   And I do have examples from my own life,
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.360]   which is not what today's about,
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:08.440]   about being really afraid and then turning things around.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.100]   My biggest fear is getting comfortable.
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:14.980]   I do not have as much of a stick oriented approach,
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:18.640]   but today's conversations changing the way I think.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.120]   I'm not gonna step away from this and think,
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.160]   okay, there are 25 neural circuits that can explain
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.720]   10 of the things that David's talking about.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.300]   And what I'm thinking about is the fact that
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.380]   everybody has a brain, they have a mind.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:32.340]   Forget the brain, the brain is just the physical structure,
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:36.080]   but what that manifests, what that creates is the mind.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.600]   And everybody has that.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.120]   So I do believe that everyone has the capacity
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.040]   to do what you're talking about at some level.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.200]   I also will be the first to confess that I think
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.880]   you're a highly unusual, let's just say,
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.760]   maybe even N of one, as we say in science.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.100]   Sample size of one.
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:01.920]   Somebody who has created this process for themselves
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.940]   and keeps themselves in this forward center of mass
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:07.740]   with the stick battering the back of their head
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.020]   all the time, highly unusual.
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:14.860]   But this internal medicine cabinet that you're talking about
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:17.200]   building up true confidence, not needing anything
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.220]   from the outside.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:23.100]   I think, I like to think that people want that.
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:26.080]   They want to be known, they're afraid,
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.400]   but that they want to be known for who they really are
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.000]   and that you're describing the path to do this.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.560]   And I will say, I'm immensely grateful that you're talking
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:37.360]   to us this way today about things that you've talked about
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.460]   before, but we're hitting it a little differently,
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.300]   I like to think.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.340]   - Very different.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:46.080]   - Because what you're talking about is a process,
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.920]   it's verbs, it's all verbs.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.320]   - All, action.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.720]   - And it's not about success.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.460]   It's more actually about keeping that friction dialed to 10.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:57.480]   - Right.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:59.640]   - And that no energy drink, no supplement.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.840]   People often misunderstand me.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.280]   They think, like I'm big on people getting sunlight
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.880]   in the mornings, they set their circadian rhythm
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.800]   and get better sleep, et cetera.
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:08.340]   But then people always think they go straight
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.640]   to the supplements.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.600]   What should I take?
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.620]   And then of course, people think I'm all about supplements.
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:14.100]   Supplements are one piece for me,
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.020]   but it's like tiny fraction compared to the doing,
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:19.020]   the dos and don'ts.
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.840]   - That's why I didn't want to talk about that today.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.620]   That's why I'm glad we're talking about this.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:23.820]   This is it.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:24.660]   This is it.
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.020]   Like the brain is the most powerful weapon in the world.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:33.020]   And it's crazy how a kid that wasn't real smart,
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:38.980]   I was forced to go only internal, external had to go away.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.580]   The external world had to go away.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:44.660]   And living so deep inside myself,
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:47.460]   it was me in this brain and figuring out
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.240]   how this thing works.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:54.020]   And it's so many people are doing exactly that,
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:56.120]   the supplements, the this, the that.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.500]   I agree, it helps.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.460]   But once you figure out your, your brain,
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:07.940]   you become unstoppable to almost anything.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:11.200]   Yeah, you can't beat death, you can't whatever, whatever.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.640]   Your brain is amazing.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.460]   Once you feed it the right conversation,
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:21.160]   the right mental nutrients, the right mental supplements,
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.020]   the right internal dialogue at the right time,
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.860]   with the right hit, with the right proof
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:30.780]   of what you've done in the past,
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.980]   and you send that right to the right circuit,
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:37.740]   dude, you're a fucking beast, a beast.
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:42.740]   But once again, you just can't read about it.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:46.420]   You can't sit back and be a theorist.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.220]   You have to be a fucking practitioner.
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:53.580]   And in that practice is where that becomes proof positive.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:57.260]   And what I'm saying is like, God, like David Goggins,
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.540]   he's blowing my mind, what is this?
[01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:01.100]   He's not crazy.
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:05.340]   And so many people, a lot of people,
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:10.720]   people have listened to me in the right way,
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:13.320]   and they come back and they're like,
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:16.840]   I'm totally on board, it happened, it happened.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:20.540]   I'm like, it'll keep going, man, if you keep doing it.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.040]   But that is it, man.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:26.500]   There's no sun, there's no glory, there's no carrot,
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:31.020]   there's no victory, but there is all of it in one.
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:33.020]   I can't explain it real well to people, man,
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.180]   but what you get the other end is something
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:39.580]   that you're not, you're always found.
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:41.540]   You're never lost anymore.
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:43.860]   Doesn't mean the journey's easy.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:46.260]   Doesn't get any easier, but you're always found.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:49.740]   - I love that, I just want to hover on that for a sec,
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:52.300]   the same way we hovered on "Haunted" and "The Stick."
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:55.280]   I think people feel lost.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:00.000]   I've certainly felt lost at times in my life, many times.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.020]   And yeah, there's that thing.
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.360]   I don't think there's a neuroscience
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.780]   or a psychology term for it.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:06.660]   Someone will say, put it in the comments and say,
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:08.140]   oh yeah, that's what so-and-so said.
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:10.440]   But like you said, we're not trying to be theoretical here,
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.280]   we're trying to be practical.
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.180]   The business of finding yourself and knowing like,
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:20.420]   but it's sort of like, I'm safe because I'm in danger
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:23.220]   and I've been in danger before and I got myself out.
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:25.380]   It always seems to come back to verbs.
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:27.740]   Again, I don't have a language for this.
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.860]   For once, I'm lost for words.
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:33.340]   There's like, it's about a process, the algorithm.
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.020]   And the reason, here I'm just kind of trying to make sure
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.580]   I'm understanding things correctly.
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:41.040]   One of the reasons why it must be uncomfortable for you
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:45.340]   to be who you are publicly is because people want to focus
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:46.460]   on the running or the swearing.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.180]   And by the way, the swearing is welcome.
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:52.020]   I'll tell you, I came up through laboratories
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:57.020]   where all three people I worked for swore a lot,
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.460]   but there was one rule.
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.140]   I couldn't swear at people.
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.580]   So my graduate advisor, brilliant woman,
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:03.580]   unfortunately, she died early.
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:04.600]   They all died early.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:07.100]   I'm the common denominator.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.980]   I had that internalized for a long time.
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:12.460]   Anyway, she said, but if you swear at people, you're out.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.140]   But you can swear as much as you want.
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.740]   So that's the rule I have.
[01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:16.900]   It's like, you can swear as much as you want,
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:17.860]   just don't swear at people.
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:20.060]   And if you swear at people, better be ready to fight.
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.200]   I'm definitely not gonna fight you.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.620]   So you can swear at me, get away with it.
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:26.960]   But the fact of the matter is that it must be frustrating
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.080]   that people, 'cause I know people go,
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:31.280]   oh, it's all about supplements and ice baths.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.240]   Listen, I like supplements.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.560]   I love supplements and ice baths,
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.960]   but that's not the full picture.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.520]   It's just a gravitational pull.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.620]   It's the swearing, it's the running.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.680]   It's his feet that are all messed up.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.100]   It's the fact that he got a Triton.
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:44.620]   It's this seal guy.
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.980]   Talk about that too, right?
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:50.080]   And there's a gravitational pull for people
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.920]   and they're missing,
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.060]   that's like the tip of the iceberg is what I'm realizing.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.540]   I'm realizing that today,
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.020]   thanks to the way you're phrasing things,
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:59.500]   'cause the bigger vessel is all in here.
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:02.160]   And as you said, how do you put that in a book?
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.200]   - It's impossible.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.520]   - 'Cause it's highly individual.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.880]   You do it your way.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.000]   And you're saying everyone needs to go figure out
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.800]   how to do it their way for them.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:10.880]   - Yes.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:14.560]   And the thing about being misunderstood is very frustrating
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.040]   more than I can even imagine.
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.400]   I can't even express how frustrating it is
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.200]   when the cussing and everything comes from a place
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.420]   of real.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.440]   I can't explain what I do without it.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.680]   The passion comes out of me,
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.700]   it's almost like speaking in tongues.
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.500]   Because when you put that much work and people go,
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.380]   "Oh yeah, there's been this basketball player,
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.980]   this football player, this..."
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:46.900]   Dude, no, no.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:51.400]   Everything, everything is work.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.240]   Everything.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:54.000]   And people don't believe it.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000]   So when I speak, the motherfucker and the fuck
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.600]   and the shit, that is what it took for me.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.720]   What it takes for me.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.720]   The anger, the passion, the jaw dropping.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:20.060]   It takes that because I'm not that.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:22.460]   This is how I look at it, man.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.240]   What built this guy?
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:27.000]   Let's imagine being in the coldest water
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.100]   you can possibly take.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.840]   I always go back to hell week with this.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.080]   I hated the water.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:34.720]   Hated it.
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.960]   You're sitting there locked arms
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.600]   and you're in the water all the time.
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.860]   And they're bringing you in and out of the water.
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:41.000]   In and out of the water.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.080]   When you have this dialogue in your head
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.480]   and these people are judging me
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:48.620]   off of a freaking one minute video.
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:51.560]   And you're constantly your whole life
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:52.960]   when you figure it out 24,
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:57.040]   I gotta, I just gotta, this fucking gotta
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.600]   and this is just gonna suck.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.800]   Every day is gonna suck.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.200]   And live like that to be better.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.560]   And I put this, I'm in the water.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:06.800]   The water is going over my head.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.520]   The Pacific ocean, you know it's freezing.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.560]   February, cold as shit.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.060]   Been through three hell weeks.
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:19.920]   For you to constantly win, win, win.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.360]   When this voice over here, the real you
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:25.480]   is saying get the fuck out of here.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:27.880]   Go, you're nobody.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.960]   You've always been nobody.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.040]   And it's true.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:33.720]   People don't hear that.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:34.680]   That's a true voice.
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.680]   That's a real reality of David Goggins at 24 years old.
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:41.520]   It's not a false reality.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:45.480]   And then you had to create another voice over here
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.920]   that is saying you're better than that other voice.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:51.840]   And you're in the freezing cold water
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.840]   that both voices don't wanna fucking be in.
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.940]   But you win.
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:02.480]   And it goes from the water to the studying
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:05.360]   to the running to losing weight to how you eat
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.960]   to how you function as a man.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.080]   Every day of your life you're winning these battles.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.240]   And then I have normal people who only have one voice.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:18.480]   Never created the second voice.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.000]   The winning voice is the second voice.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.660]   They have one voice and that's just, I'm a piece of shit.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:28.380]   That's all they hear.
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:31.960]   And then they judge people like me
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.960]   who are out here trying to be better.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:37.500]   It's something that I can never really,
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:41.180]   it's a frustrating thing for me.
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:46.360]   'Cause I know the majority of people.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:47.360]   I know what goes on in the brain
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:50.320]   but I studied the mind almost more than you.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:53.460]   'Cause I'm a practitioner.
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:56.520]   So for you to be a piece of shit and come out of that,
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.840]   you don't just come out of it.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:03.840]   You spend decades studying your mind and the human mind
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:09.660]   on how it functions in good environments, bad environments,
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:12.380]   stressful environments, patient environment.
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.720]   You studied all because you had to put all this together
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.720]   to create the mind to become successful.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:22.600]   So I had to be like, God blessed me with this brain.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.060]   I had to create a mind.
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:27.680]   And so in doing so, I figured out every piece of shit
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.640]   human being in the world
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:31.320]   'cause that's what I was going off of for myself.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.640]   So I know why you go on Instagram.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:39.640]   I know why you, 'cause you just have the time.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:43.920]   You have the time because you don't wanna put that time
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:46.740]   into bettering oneself.
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:50.000]   So I know why I'm misunderstood.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.220]   I'm misunderstood by people who have plenty of time
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.340]   on their hands to misunderstand me
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:58.200]   because they are exactly where I once was,
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:00.920]   which is a low life, lazy piece of shit.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:04.840]   And it's the harsh reality of people who troll you,
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.800]   who go after you.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:09.520]   They have nothing better to do with their lives.
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.920]   It's not some afterschool special.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.120]   It's the truth by once was that way.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:17.300]   I know where it all comes from.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.640]   That's why it's frustrating to me now
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.560]   'cause I'm not so frustrated at the fact
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.620]   that I'm being trolled.
[01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:25.800]   I'm frustrated by the fact that you don't have the courage,
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.960]   the courage to try to be somebody better
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.800]   than which you're not.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.400]   And that's the frustrating part.
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:35.280]   - It's interesting because earlier we were talking
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:39.560]   about relationships and you said in a very candid way,
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.140]   and I really appreciate you sharing that,
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.040]   that you make sure that the people close to you,
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.080]   your family has everything they need
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.720]   and that they also understand that you're gonna take
[01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:49.620]   what you need to continue to build you, period.
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:50.960]   - Period.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:55.680]   - In some ways, it seems you've also included
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:58.160]   the general public in that family.
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:01.480]   You're saying, listen, I'm gonna give you what you need.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.680]   I'm gonna give you as much of myself as I can,
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:06.620]   except I'm gonna stop right at the line
[02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:10.160]   that if I were to cross it is gonna prevent me
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.680]   from continuing to build myself.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:14.560]   And by the way, this relationship only exists
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.440]   because I don't cross that line.
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.480]   - That's right.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:21.460]   - And I think as much as there are detractors out there,
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:23.360]   people that try, right?
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.020]   I mean, it's pretty, whatever they're doing
[02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:26.480]   is pretty feeble in my mind.
[02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:29.880]   I mean, it's like cap gun fire, if that.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:30.720]   - Very feeble.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:37.720]   - So many of us, men and women, old and young,
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:40.840]   hear something and feel something in your message.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:43.680]   Like, yeah, like it seems kind of crazy.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.220]   Gosh, like, doesn't he ever just relax?
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.320]   What about his sleep?
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.160]   Look at his feet.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:50.860]   He's gonna injure himself.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:51.800]   Listen, I'll be very direct.
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.260]   I got friends who were in the teams who just go,
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:55.720]   what's he gonna do when he can't run?
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:58.600]   And I know the answer is keep running, right?
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:02.900]   But it's more comfortable for people, even high achievers.
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:04.220]   - Especially high achievers.
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.480]   - To believe that if you took one thing away
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.880]   that it would all go away.
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.080]   - It's absolutely clear that's not the case with you.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.380]   I'm 100% convinced.
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:14.400]   I just know that 'cause what we're talking about is this.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.400]   - Do you know how many times I haven't been able to run?
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.000]   Two heart surgeries, multiple knee surgeries,
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.240]   and after every knee surgery,
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:22.200]   they say you're not gonna run again.
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:23.400]   And I'm fine with that.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:26.940]   There's no running up here, bro.
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:27.780]   None.
[02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:29.640]   This was what it was all about.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:30.840]   That's what they lost.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:31.920]   What if you can't run?
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.860]   Give a fuck?
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:35.980]   It was never about running.
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:37.760]   Why do you think I run?
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:39.480]   It's the worst thing.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.960]   I hate doing it more than anything.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.800]   Hence the willpower.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:45.640]   - Right.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.840]   Your anterior mid-singulate cortex would be,
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.440]   would start to regress if you loved running.
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:51.280]   - Think about it.
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.280]   Every day I wake up, I don't just run a mile, two miles.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.400]   It's the one thing I hate the most to do,
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.360]   and I do it like I love it.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.280]   250, 60, 700, 300 mile runs at one time.
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.560]   No sleep in every step.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:11.800]   When I get to, think about this.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.700]   I get to the fucking start line, cussing at Jennifer.
[02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:17.960]   Why the fuck am I here?
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.040]   I hate this shit.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:23.020]   After 70 some hours of running,
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:26.140]   every fucking question I ever had is answered.
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:29.500]   Every question I had is answered.
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:30.800]   I cap success.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.420]   I don't, people go, we mean you cap success.
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:42.840]   For me to be who I am, so when I go smoke jump,
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:47.840]   I'll smoke jump three to four months out of the year,
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.680]   sometimes five.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:51.840]   - Could you just for those that aren't educated about,
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:54.280]   just like give us a brief description
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:55.520]   of what smoke jumping entails.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.960]   - So basically you jump into fires, not into them,
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:04.040]   but you jump by fires that people can't get to.
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:07.400]   - So out of planes and helicopters, fast lines.
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.800]   - It's all parachuting.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.220]   So you parachute out of airplanes
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:11.280]   and then you fight the fire.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.680]   You and sometimes four other guys
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.160]   or maybe eight other guys, guys and gals,
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:18.480]   and you're putting this fire out.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.540]   So I lose millions of dollars every summer to do this.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:24.760]   It blows people's minds.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:25.880]   Why the hell are you doing this?
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:27.080]   - And you're breathing soot.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.320]   - I'm being soot, knees are jacked up,
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:31.860]   hitting the ground, hurting, whatever.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:34.600]   Talking to normal people that never get it
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:36.360]   so I don't even explain it to them.
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:40.420]   But this is why I call it cap success.
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.880]   I'm talking financial success.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.020]   For me to continue having that willpower,
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:50.960]   the second I just become a speaking monkey
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.280]   and travel around and speaking gigs
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.880]   12 months out of the year, put camps on,
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:59.360]   do this, put on lectures, get supplement lines
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.160]   and do this and write more books and shit,
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.160]   I've ruined the exact thing I worked on my entire life.
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:10.920]   And while I didn't know it until the day,
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:14.680]   but something always told me this is a very,
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.560]   very, very perishable skill, this willpower that you have.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:21.320]   'Cause I do have a willpower that I have never seen
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:22.840]   in anybody in my life.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.840]   It is a haunting force that just keeps me going.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:28.800]   And I know that that is my strength.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:33.780]   If you have that, so that's worth every dime
[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:36.680]   I've ever made in my life is the fact
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:38.960]   I can look a man in the eye finally
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.600]   and have a real conversation without going like this
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.140]   'cause I'm lying or I'm a piece of shit or I know.
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:47.440]   You know how a person, and so many people do this shit,
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:52.240]   they're talking to you on who they want to be.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:55.320]   They're lying to you and they walk away.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.160]   I've done it so many times.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.680]   You walk away like, God, man,
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:59.640]   why can't I just tell him the truth?
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:02.480]   Why the hell can I just tell him the truth?
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:06.720]   No, good it feels for me now to look at you in your eye
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:11.140]   and every man and man I see, 'cause women won't get this.
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:13.360]   Women will not get this.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.800]   Man to man, that man shit.
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:17.320]   You look another man in the eye
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:20.120]   and you know that everything you're fucking saying is real.
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.680]   And it comes from a real working place,
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.560]   something that you earned.
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:25.920]   It's the best feeling in the world.
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.880]   - You can say that actually happened.
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:29.240]   - Yes. - Like I know with certainty
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:30.480]   what I'm saying actually happened.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.520]   - Actually happened.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:35.260]   Who I am and who I say I am, I am.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:39.960]   No more lies, no more skirting the truth, no more bullshit.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:43.980]   And that is worth every dime I've ever made in my life.
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:47.360]   And that is, I swear to God on that.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:50.020]   Every dime I've ever made in my life,
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:53.260]   building who I built so I can cap success
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:58.260]   because I know that if I ever go 12 months out of the year
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:01.220]   and don't put several, every day I'm going at it,
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.980]   but several months out of the year,
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:04.820]   I go right back to ground zero,
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:09.420]   which means I'm just fucking David Goggins.
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.740]   No Goggins, no carry boats fucking logs bullshit.
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:16.720]   It's just pick up that fucking Pulaski and dig.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:21.940]   Hey, get that fucking pump, walk down a mile,
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:24.200]   put it in the fucking water, mosquitoes beating.
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:27.220]   You're just David Goggins, you're nobody.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:28.940]   'Cause that's where my growth is.
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:31.060]   That's where my willpower comes from.
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:32.840]   And that's where it stays.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:34.200]   That's when I talk to you now.
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:36.420]   And can't I talk like this, dude?
[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:37.540]   People don't talk with this kind of passion
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:40.680]   'cause it ain't there, it ain't there.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:44.420]   They're regurgitating some shit from 30 fucking years ago.
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:48.360]   I'm regurgitating shit from an hour ago, hour ago.
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:53.380]   Come on, man, it's just be real.
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:55.340]   And I can't be on these podcasts.
[02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:57.860]   I can't talk to anybody without being real.
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:06:59.220]   I'll go away.
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.340]   I'll just go away.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:03.500]   'Cause I can't give you what I wanna give you.
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:07.340]   - You said perishable skill.
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:10.380]   I think that's another set of words I wanna highlight
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:12.700]   'cause skill implies behavior.
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:14.780]   And when we were just talking a second ago
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:19.520]   about the deep, true bedrock sense of confidence
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:21.260]   that comes from looking someone in the eye
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.660]   and telling somebody something
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:25.900]   that you absolutely know it's true because it happened.
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:27.400]   You're talking about actions,
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:29.380]   not talking about perceptions.
[02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:32.060]   You're not talking about what you believe happened.
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:33.780]   You know it happened.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:35.940]   And there's something really concrete about actions.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.620]   I mean, that's what's so interesting
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:38.940]   is we're talking about the mind,
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:42.340]   but actions are the manifestation of the mind.
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:45.300]   And the stuff that just stays in here,
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:47.300]   people die with that.
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:49.220]   It doesn't go anywhere.
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:51.640]   Long ago, somebody said,
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:53.680]   I forget what the context was, it was a neuroscientist.
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:57.700]   He said, "Most emotions, they're just emotions.
[02:07:57.700 --> 02:07:58.780]   They're just in there.
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.640]   Like you don't have to do anything with them."
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.240]   And I think certain emotions you want to do something with.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:04.300]   But I think people forget this.
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:05.140]   They feel miserable,
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:07.460]   like they're gonna dissolve into puddle of their own tears.
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:09.840]   No one ever died from an emotion.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:12.280]   But they feel like they overwhelm us
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.240]   as if it's a tidal wave.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:15.380]   It's gonna pull us under and drown us.
[02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:18.640]   It's so interesting to me because I think what people,
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.400]   listen, you have a gravitational pull.
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.720]   People can feel the energy.
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:26.760]   I think, yes, you're either completely badly
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:28.080]   or partially understood.
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:29.280]   There's only one guy on the planet
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:30.640]   that truly understands you.
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.840]   I think there's one woman, Jennifer,
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.960]   who probably understands you as much as anyone's going to.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.520]   And then the rest of us are kind of grasping,
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.560]   trying to figure it out.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:39.960]   But you're saying go inward.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:45.680]   So first go inward and then it's actions.
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:46.520]   Inward and actions.
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.000]   Now the inward piece is something
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.040]   I'd like to just spend a little bit of time on
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:51.920]   because there are a couple of characters from history,
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:53.840]   people that were in concentration camps.
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.200]   Nelson Mandela.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:57.400]   I mean, I'm not sure he had Instagram in there.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:58.840]   I'm pretty sure he didn't.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:00.760]   And I don't think there was anyone coaching him on like,
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:02.880]   "Hey, you're gonna get out someday
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.440]   and actually you're gonna lead an entire country."
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.400]   I'm pretty sure that's not how it worked.
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:08.920]   He had to find it here.
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:11.100]   He had to find it between his ears.
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:15.080]   And there are other examples, but that's an important one.
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:19.840]   So the process of going inward, does it for you,
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.440]   and here I will ask for suggestions.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.920]   'Cause I think people want,
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:25.960]   there are those of us who want to build this skill.
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:30.680]   Wall yourself off, phone off
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:33.320]   for big portions of the day perhaps.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:39.220]   Texting off, the requests, the this, the that.
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:42.560]   Anyone that knows you knows that.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:43.760]   We've communicated a few texts,
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:45.560]   but most of it comes through a filter.
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:48.040]   She's great, she knows you,
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.760]   and she knows how to protect your time.
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.720]   - And that hurts people's feelings.
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:51.600]   People get mad about that.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.920]   - Hey, God bless.
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:54.120]   God bless you, Jennifer.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:10:01.560]   Cutting oneself off when you're in there,
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:02.820]   you say it's just you.
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:08.580]   And the voices that come up are not pleasant.
[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:14.100]   And then at some point it converts to action.
[02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:19.960]   Okay, how much, what is the process of picking the action?
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.500]   That's the piece that I feel like
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:24.460]   there's like a bridge to build here,
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.540]   if you can, if you would.
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.780]   - So the action, you mean like what's next?
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:30.220]   - Yeah, so when you go to sleep at night,
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:33.500]   when that happens, you know what you're gonna do
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:35.020]   the next day, it's pre-planned?
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:35.860]   - Yes.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:36.700]   - Okay.
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:37.900]   - Yes, it's always the same thing.
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:39.220]   - You're not building it on the fly.
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:41.040]   - No, nothing's on the fly.
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.240]   Nothing, so how it works internally for me is I'm,
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:48.000]   I put it exactly how it is.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.720]   I'm an artist and every day I'm painting Mona Lisa.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:56.820]   Every day, but it's a different one.
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:58.440]   It's not the same painting.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.760]   So every day I wake up, even though I do the same thing,
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:02.980]   it takes a different way to get there.
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:04.840]   So every day in my mind, I'm going through my mind,
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:09.840]   I'm just like, and a good painter will not just paint.
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:15.300]   He needs to create and you can't create the phones
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.740]   and everything going around you.
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:19.240]   So you gotta block yourself off.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:21.940]   You only do two podcasts in a year.
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.020]   You block yourself off and you're painting this thing inside
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:27.980]   and you're going through all these different colors of paint
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:29.620]   and everything else.
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:32.300]   And you can only figure out the right painting
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:35.280]   if you spend the correct amount of time in your brain.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:37.980]   So every single day I'm literally going through my mind
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:42.700]   and I'm painting, I'm creating this masterpiece.
[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:45.260]   And the masterpiece is always myself.
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:49.260]   And, but to do that, you cannot have any distractions
[02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:50.840]   because if you're talking to an artist
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.760]   and he's trying to think about the next painting, he can't.
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:57.200]   So it's impossible to listen to you
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.200]   and listen to what your mind and body
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.500]   are telling you we must do.
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:04.660]   People don't do enough of, they don't do any of it.
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:06.700]   You're, they don't have passion.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:08.440]   They lack passion driving determination
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:11.580]   because you haven't spent time with yourself.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.780]   Your mind will tell you what is next,
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:18.300]   but you haven't spent the time to go,
[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:22.060]   all right, let me just figure this out.
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:26.220]   You're looking for, let me Google this
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:27.880]   and let me Google that and let me,
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.580]   you're not going to find it there
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:33.640]   because there's billions of people in this world
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:38.760]   and they're all supposed to be individuals.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:41.820]   We have a pack mentality.
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:45.060]   That's why you're so fucking lost.
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:47.060]   Why am I so unique?
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:50.840]   I'm being exactly what the fuck I was supposed to be.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:52.500]   I ain't follow shit.
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:55.860]   And when I did follow shit, I was like everybody else.
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:58.920]   The second I said, okay, man, hang on, dude,
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:00.640]   you don't like this, you don't like this,
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:01.720]   you don't like this.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:04.380]   Who are you, David Goggins?
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:05.740]   Who are you supposed to be?
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:09.580]   Miraculously, all these things just,
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:15.660]   I couldn't even, the list of shit I had to do just wham.
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:18.220]   It's like fuck, okay, wow.
[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:19.740]   Once you sit down with yourself and say,
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:23.040]   okay, I don't want to be like Michael Jordan or Jim Brown,
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:23.980]   both were on my birthday.
[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:25.420]   So I looked at their birthdays like,
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:27.020]   maybe I can be one of these, I can't.
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.040]   I'm going to be David fucking Goggins.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:34.800]   And that looks like this.
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:37.860]   It just came, everything flooded.
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:40.080]   So every single day of my life,
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.480]   there's a different thing that comes up that I have to do.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:45.860]   But no one knows what to do
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:49.180]   because everybody else is following steps.
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:51.580]   Like the Republican and Democratic parties.
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:52.720]   I'm not political.
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:53.780]   - Neither am I.
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:56.180]   - At all, for this reason.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:58.220]   Republicans are going to vote Republican.
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:01.100]   Democrats are going to vote Democrat.
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:05.580]   You're not even a human fucking being, bro.
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:09.340]   No way all you fuckers agree with all the same fucking shit.
[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:11.020]   And I know I don't.
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:14.500]   So once you figure out yourself and who you are,
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:16.620]   all the answers come.
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:20.660]   So every night, a different painting is being painted.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:22.340]   And it's a beautiful painting for myself.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:23.740]   Like, okay, that's it.
[02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:26.580]   It may look the same to most motherfuckers,
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:29.860]   but the end result is very fucking different.
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:32.740]   That's why my launch, if you look at what I've done
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:36.580]   in 49 years, it's more than most people ever do in their life
[02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:39.820]   because they were a race car driver.
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:41.420]   And that's what they did.
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:42.980]   They drove a fucking car.
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:43.800]   It's great.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:47.820]   I was all kind of shit
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:50.940]   because that's exactly what the painting was saying to do,
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:52.460]   what the mind was saying to do.
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:53.380]   Wasn't saying to drive a car,
[02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:55.620]   so then that race car driver know what the fuck to do.
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:59.820]   He retires from being a race car driver and they're lost.
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:03.420]   How are you still, I don't get it.
[02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:06.380]   Dude, you're never going to fill your list,
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:08.580]   but you never found your list
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:10.300]   'cause it never was presented in front of you
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.220]   because your head was cluttered with shit.
[02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:18.300]   'Cause you never just stopped for lots of minutes,
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:21.520]   lots of years, and just said, "All right, it's me and you.
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.760]   Let it go."
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:27.520]   And it just, bam, it's right there, right there.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.940]   - I'm not a psychologist, as I mentioned before,
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:35.500]   but I'm going to venture a hypothesis here.
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:42.900]   I think that you've mastered the process
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:44.980]   of internal dialogue.
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:47.460]   But when I say dialogue, I think most people think,
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:50.620]   oh, the inner voice, the chatter,
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:52.140]   but that's just one half of a dialogue.
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:53.760]   A dialogue is a two-way street.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:59.300]   So I completely agree 'cause I know from experience
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.380]   that when we go inward, oftentimes we hear things,
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:03.100]   if we're really honest with ourselves, it's like,
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:05.700]   I don't want to think about that or that, no.
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:06.980]   And then we start looking outward
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:10.700]   or we start trying to shift our attention or distract.
[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:14.140]   And there are a million reasons that are handed to us,
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:17.500]   excuses and seemingly good justifications
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:18.620]   to be able to do that.
[02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:21.520]   But dialogue is a two-way street.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.620]   And it hit me while you were just saying
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.780]   what you were saying, I was paying very close attention.
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:30.300]   And I realized David Goggins is talking about
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:32.940]   the voice that comes up, including the terrible stuff
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:37.020]   that no one wants to hear about themselves, from themselves.
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:39.400]   But then he's also got the dialogue down
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.100]   where he knows the counter voice.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:42.640]   He goes, "Yeah, you're right.
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:43.600]   And so I'm going to do this."
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:47.860]   Or maybe, no, remember this.
[02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:51.240]   You're in a dialogue, a two-way dialogue in there,
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:53.400]   not a one-way chatter dialogue.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.960]   There are books written by famous psychologists
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:58.660]   about chatter, trying to shift your internal narrative.
[02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:01.640]   You're like, bring the internal narrative.
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.260]   That's what going inward is about, but it's not one voice.
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:06.420]   Again, there's a hypothesis.
[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:07.800]   I'm not claiming to be all knowing.
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.240]   Lord knows I'm not all knowing, okay?
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.880]   But you've mastered the dialogue.
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:15.060]   And if there are three voices,
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.220]   strong, medium, and weak in there,
[02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:19.380]   you're like, let's all come to the table.
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:22.340]   So you've got a symphony of voices in there
[02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:24.840]   that are all you that you know to be you,
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.980]   and you know how to have those conversations.
[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:28.940]   You're not afraid to be in those conversations.
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:31.540]   And then you know what the outcome
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:33.060]   of that committee decision is,
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:35.880]   and you put it into real-world action.
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.380]   And the world only sees the action.
[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:42.700]   And only you can know your internal dialogue,
[02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:44.740]   and only I can know my internal dialogue.
[02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:47.140]   And the only way to quote-unquote know it
[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:49.060]   is to spend a hell of a lot of time there.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:50.500]   - That's right. - Okay.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:51.980]   - A lifetime. - Got it.
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:53.540]   - A lifetime.
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:54.380]   Think about it.
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:58.740]   For me to be sitting here in front of you,
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:02.440]   you're not gonna call 300-pound Ecolab guy
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:03.280]   to come sit here.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.020]   You might, I don't know, maybe.
[02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:06.860]   - Probably not. - Probably not.
[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:07.840]   Think about this.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:14.220]   What we teach people is kindness to yourself.
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:19.300]   Do you think if I taught myself kindness,
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:20.580]   and I agree with it, God,
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:23.780]   so many people take me out of context, it's ridiculous.
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:27.020]   Take it however the fuck you wanna take it.
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:28.440]   When I was 300 pounds,
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:32.060]   where do you think that conversation would've got me
[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:34.260]   if I spoke kindness to myself?
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:36.060]   I'll tell you where it gets me.
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:37.580]   Right back to 7-Eleven,
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:39.180]   another box of mini chocolate donuts
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:40.420]   and a chocolate milkshake.
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:43.340]   That's the one voice.
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:47.420]   That's the one voice that most of us have
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:48.660]   that you're talking about.
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:50.740]   If you wanna have a conversation in there,
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:52.460]   the other voice that you create that says,
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:56.420]   okay, how does this look?
[02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:57.500]   It looks very ugly.
[02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:01.740]   That kind conversation for me went away a long time ago,
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:04.700]   which is why the dialogue is now,
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:06.300]   which you see a lot of action,
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:10.340]   because most people have inaction,
[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:12.220]   'cause there's one person talking,
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:15.460]   and that one person's always leading you down the same path,
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:19.100]   the path that makes you feel very comfortable
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:20.420]   and happy with yourself.
[02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:24.100]   The second you create the other voice, there's conflict.
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:29.820]   There's battles, there's wars, there's defeat.
[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:32.020]   One thing I learned, and I taught myself this,
[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:33.540]   and people go, I don't understand what you're saying.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:35.820]   I'm gonna try to break it down real quick.
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:40.060]   I didn't teach myself victory first.
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.680]   I taught myself failure.
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:46.080]   I taught myself how to fail.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:50.100]   And people go, that's so depressing.
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:51.200]   Is it?
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:53.420]   When you're 300 pounds and you can't read and write
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:55.020]   and you're fucked up,
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:58.500]   there'll be times you're gonna fucking fail on that process.
[02:19:58.500 --> 02:20:01.420]   So if you don't know how to fail, there is no victory.
[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:04.540]   I never talked about winning,
[02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:07.980]   'cause I knew the path to winning
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:11.060]   was gonna be years of failing first.
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:13.880]   So I taught myself how to fail properly.
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:16.920]   No one teaches you how to fucking fail.
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:22.460]   But if you're going out for insurmountable fucking odds
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:24.860]   that make absolutely no fucking sense,
[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.420]   a black kid that can't swim,
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:28.020]   300 pounds gonna be a Navy Seal.
[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:29.820]   Okay.
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:34.220]   You better teach yourself how to fail first,
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:38.980]   because if you sit in failure for too long,
[02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:41.060]   you will never come out of it.
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:44.900]   So the first part of my success
[02:20:44.900 --> 02:20:47.180]   was learning how to fail properly.
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:52.620]   And then eventually, I started getting a few victories,
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:55.540]   but that's what people don't get.
[02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:59.300]   When you have buried yourself in such a deep fucking hole,
[02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:01.100]   you better first talk about the failures
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:01.940]   you're gonna have first,
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:03.220]   and that's when that other voice comes up.
[02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:04.460]   It tells you, we gotta do something.
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:08.900]   It also tells you, boy, I'm not gonna lie to you, Goggins,
[02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:12.420]   you're in for a fucking climb, bro.
[02:21:12.420 --> 02:21:15.140]   You're gonna get your ass handed to you,
[02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:19.040]   made fun of, the outside noise, the inside noise.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.060]   Both voices are gonna be fucking telling you
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:22.100]   to go fuck yourself.
[02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:24.000]   You are in for hell, bro.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.860]   I am.
[02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:29.800]   So I better learn to fail.
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.100]   - So this is what you mean when you say
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.740]   that whatever anyone says, it's insignificant.
[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:34.620]   - Insignificant as fuck.
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:35.940]   - Right, it's the cap gun fire,
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:40.780]   because the voice in your own head is far worse.
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:44.300]   And I should say, sorry, one of the voices in your head.
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:45.140]   - Yes.
[02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:47.580]   - I'm being very detailed, almost surgical about that,
[02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:49.260]   because I think this thing about inner dialogue
[02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:50.700]   we think is one voice.
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:53.880]   You're making it clear it's many voices.
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:54.940]   - It is.
[02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:59.600]   And the thing about it is you have to be really,
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.780]   and sometimes all the voices are telling you
[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:03.460]   the wrong shit, man.
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:07.660]   But through years, years, not a podcast
[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:09.640]   or listening to a book or reading a book,
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:14.640]   years of sacrifice, of suffering, of diligent,
[02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:18.820]   pinpoint fucking work on what you wanna do for yourself.
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:23.820]   Not like, oh, let me just do a bunch of shit.
[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:28.060]   Let me, I wanna be in every task possible.
[02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:33.060]   No, pinpoint what I want to do with my life.
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:36.960]   What happens is you have all these voices
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:38.380]   that are telling you you're fucked up
[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:39.500]   and this is gonna be hard.
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:43.080]   But for some reason, you put so much practice into you
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:47.560]   that you can ignore every one of them
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:50.760]   that are telling you you're not gonna fucking make it
[02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:52.600]   and still be able to fucking make it.
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:55.840]   Because you have put the practice in
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:59.620]   that you know this is the process.
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:02.040]   It's such a daunting task
[02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:04.680]   that all the voices are saying no.
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:08.960]   But you still have the conviction that I know I can do this.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:12.140]   And that's what it took for me to get here.
[02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:18.200]   20, 30 years ago, I had this 35 or whatever it was,
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:20.740]   30 to 25 years ago, pipe dream.
[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:24.040]   And ever since then, every voice was like,
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:25.600]   you're a fucking nut.
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:29.400]   But when you put that practice in,
[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:30.600]   every day you lace them up.
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:32.400]   And I don't mean run.
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:34.960]   It's just a metaphor for life.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.820]   When you lace them motherfuckers up every day,
[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:38.760]   pretty soon you win.
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:40.440]   Pretty soon you'll fucking win.
[02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.600]   If you have the courage and the heart and the dedication
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:45.640]   and the mindset about everybody can go fuck themselves.
[02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:46.900]   I know what I know.
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:49.040]   I've listened to myself enough to know.
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:51.360]   I know what I know.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:53.260]   None of you can hear what I'm hearing.
[02:23:54.260 --> 02:23:55.620]   And that's what people don't do enough of.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:58.420]   They don't listen to their journey.
[02:23:58.420 --> 02:24:00.620]   They listen to everybody else's shit.
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:02.340]   Before you know it, I'm crazy.
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:05.980]   But if I'm so fucking crazy, why am I so successful?
[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:07.840]   How'd that happen?
[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:14.020]   I'm so misguided and fucked up and don't listen to him.
[02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:20.740]   Why am I the only one to do a whole bunch of shit?
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:22.200]   Why am I a trailblazer?
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.040]   Why?
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:24.860]   How is that possible?
[02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:28.080]   How can you be fucked up and also self-made
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:30.720]   the same fucking, no, no.
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:35.000]   Obviously you're not looking at the truth in front of you.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.480]   The truth in front of you is it sucks.
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:38.440]   It's painful.
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:41.160]   It's fucking mind numbing.
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:44.320]   And that is the truth.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:48.480]   And that's why a lot of people don't like listening to me.
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:51.120]   'Cause this is what it takes, creating another voice
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:52.960]   and sometimes going at it alone.
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:55.040]   All the time going at it alone.
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:57.000]   'Cause no one's gonna believe in you.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:57.840]   And that's that.
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:01.880]   - What I'm about to say is not conjecture.
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:04.080]   And I can say that with confidence
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:06.160]   because I did a four episode guest series
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:08.080]   with a brilliant psychiatrist.
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:10.080]   A guy named Paul Conte, he's from Trenton.
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:12.640]   He's a Stanford Harvard trained guy.
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:13.880]   He's also got a lot of street in him.
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:15.920]   He's had his own hardship, real hardship.
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:17.760]   He's brilliant.
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:20.400]   And he said something that I'll never forget,
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.680]   which is, we think that the forebrain,
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:25.880]   the part of our brain that creates strategy, et cetera,
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:26.800]   is the supercomputer.
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:29.120]   He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.760]   It's like the supercomputer of the brain
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:33.240]   is the unconscious mind.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:35.220]   It's the part of our mind
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:37.300]   that's controlling most everything.
[02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:41.080]   And most people unfortunately don't do the work
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:43.920]   to understand how their unconscious is controlling them.
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:45.120]   And that's a scary thing.
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.160]   This idea like your mind is controlling you.
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:49.100]   And I'm not gonna get into the free will debate.
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:51.420]   I believe in at least some will.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:57.420]   I believe what you're describing and this internal dialogue,
[02:25:57.420 --> 02:26:02.220]   I think you have access to your unconscious mind.
[02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.280]   By listening to the dialogue, going inward,
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:07.880]   we know this is true in sleep, in dreams, in meditation,
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:10.280]   and just by shutting out everything else,
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:12.180]   shutting out all the external noise,
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:14.420]   which is filled with things that pull us twice.
[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:15.560]   Noise makes it sound bad,
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.640]   but it's the gravitational pull of all the things
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:20.920]   that just allow us to distract ourselves without knowing
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:25.360]   that the ice cream, the have a cookie, the Merry Christmas.
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.940]   The unconscious mind,
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:30.140]   this huge piece of the iceberg underneath
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:32.980]   that Paul calls the supercomputer.
[02:26:32.980 --> 02:26:35.220]   He's saying that with knowledge as a neurobiologist,
[02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:38.140]   psychiatrist, psychologist, and he really knows.
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:41.700]   That's the piece that if one does real introspection,
[02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:42.580]   he calls it the cupboards.
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:43.600]   You gotta look in the cupboards,
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:45.800]   and it's often really scary what you find in there.
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.120]   And most people are just like,
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:48.960]   "I don't even wanna know the cupboards are there."
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.260]   But you're pulling all the cupboard doors open.
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:55.360]   And then you're extremely deliberate
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:57.180]   with what gets put into action.
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:26:59.060]   You're not just going,
[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:00.820]   "Oh, like I'm pissed, so I'm gonna act pissed,"
[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:04.440]   or, "I'm tired, so I'm gonna act tired."
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.860]   You're picking very carefully what to do.
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:11.100]   And that's a process that I'm guessing came to you,
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:12.340]   does it come to you as a,
[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:16.080]   okay, it makes sense why running makes sense.
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:18.520]   It makes sense why smoke jumping makes sense.
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:25.720]   So it seems like a huge portion of your time
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:30.700]   is spent understanding yourself and making sense to you.
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:32.500]   And so when people don't understand you,
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:34.420]   it's gotta be extra frustrating,
[02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:35.960]   'cause most people don't understand themselves,
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.320]   so that we're all running around going like,
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.760]   "You're this and you're that,"
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.900]   'cause most people are just unwilling to look inward.
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:42.780]   And I'm including myself, by the way.
[02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:44.420]   I mean, I've done a fair amount of introspection,
[02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:47.940]   but I'm inspired today, that word inspire, but it's true,
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:52.940]   motivated to start going inward further.
[02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:53.980]   'Cause it is scary.
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:55.980]   It's like, we don't know what's in those cupboards
[02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:59.300]   and it's terrifying, especially 'cause we don't know.
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:01.660]   - And those are the first ones that open up.
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:03.700]   And like he talked about, you gotta go through those cupboards.
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:07.660]   I do spring clean every fucking day in those dark cupboards,
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:10.900]   those dark cabinets, the ones I start with first.
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:12.100]   That's the real me, man.
[02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:14.220]   That's the real me.
[02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:15.780]   I'm not ashamed.
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:18.100]   I don't hide.
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:19.260]   I used to hide.
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:20.620]   I don't hide anymore.
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:21.640]   He's exactly right.
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:25.060]   I don't know all the fucking science behind shit.
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:26.420]   I know what I know.
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:28.300]   That's why I don't listen to anybody anymore.
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:29.140]   I don't listen to shit.
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:30.780]   I think most people are full of shit.
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:31.780]   'Cause I know.
[02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:35.920]   I know the deep, dark secrets of those fucking cupboards.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.200]   It's ugly, man.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:38.460]   And every day I'm talking to them,
[02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:39.300]   every day I'm cleaning them.
[02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:40.980]   I'm cleaning them and I'm talking to the same demons
[02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:42.780]   that came out of those fucking cupboards
[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.940]   as I'm cleaning them.
[02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:45.940]   Sometimes I go right back in them again.
[02:28:45.940 --> 02:28:48.100]   It's not easy.
[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:53.740]   And this is why most of us just YM misunderstood.
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:58.260]   Because what comes out of those cabinets that I'm cleaning,
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:01.800]   sometimes they see on Instagram.
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:03.180]   Sometimes they'll see it in the pocket.
[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:04.500]   Sometimes they see it in this one.
[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:06.060]   I turn people off.
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:09.420]   Open up your own cabinets.
[02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:13.500]   And then go talk about it.
[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:15.260]   Let me see how pretty it looks.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:17.300]   Let me see how pretty you sound.
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:20.500]   Let me see how put together your words are.
[02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:22.480]   I bet you a fuck or a motherfucker comes out
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:24.900]   because for you to go back in there again
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:27.820]   to clean the same fucking cabinet a demon came out of,
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:29.260]   takes some big balls, bro.
[02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:32.700]   To do it every day of your life.
[02:29:32.700 --> 02:29:37.180]   To go back in there and spring clean every day.
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:39.940]   Not once a fucking year.
[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:41.560]   Once every decade.
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:44.100]   Every day you know it gets dusty.
[02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:48.180]   And every day, you don't start with the victories.
[02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:49.500]   You don't go, oh, this is nice.
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:51.260]   Look at my, I love me wall.
[02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:52.600]   Let me clean up this little dusty.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:56.460]   No, I go right for the things that are gonna keep me buried.
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:57.480]   I go right there first
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:59.540]   'cause if I don't clean those out first,
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:00.600]   the day doesn't start.
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:03.420]   So what are you saying?
[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:05.320]   To me, it's truth.
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:08.660]   And like I told you many times today,
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:13.600]   I can never figure out how to explain this shit to people
[02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:16.980]   because I'm not neuro nothing.
[02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:19.280]   I'm just a guy that said, okay,
[02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:20.900]   we gotta start in the dungeon
[02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:25.640]   and we gotta stay here for the rest of our lives.
[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:27.160]   For you to become successful,
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:29.540]   the dungeon is a place that has to be clean.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:33.180]   And it's the scariest place to be.
[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:35.100]   That's why I'm misunderstood
[02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.240]   'cause I'm speaking from the dungeon.
[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:39.220]   That's why I am successful
[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:42.220]   'cause I go there every damn day.
[02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:44.740]   And that is the truth what he says.
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:46.420]   It's the exact truth.
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:51.420]   Those cabinets are fucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit.
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:56.620]   Broken glass, fucking dark, spiders, cobwebs,
[02:30:56.620 --> 02:31:01.820]   but most of all, your biggest fears.
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:03.140]   The biggest things that put you
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:05.880]   in the fucked up place you are today are in there.
[02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:07.580]   That's why we all like to keep them shut,
[02:31:07.580 --> 02:31:10.060]   even like to lock them up, act like they never happen.
[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:12.100]   That's why you never grow.
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:13.360]   You never improve.
[02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:14.780]   You never have real conversations
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:16.020]   like we're having right now.
[02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:17.700]   Never, never.
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:19.580]   Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:21.640]   Let's not, no, no, no, let's not go there.
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.740]   I talk to so many people who tell me that.
[02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:26.940]   Let's talk about this.
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:31.420]   'Cause they'll tell me, but they can only say it once.
[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:32.680]   And they'll say it in passing.
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:35.240]   They won't get deep in the weeds with it.
[02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:38.300]   Like you can't just clean it, motherfucker.
[02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:40.860]   You got to spit shine that motherfucker.
[02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:42.940]   You got to relive it.
[02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:45.180]   Every fucking detail of it.
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:47.760]   You can't just be like, oh yeah, yeah, my dad beat me.
[02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:51.460]   And they, you know, you know, it is what it is.
[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:52.860]   It is what it is, motherfucker.
[02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:53.740]   It's killing you.
[02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:57.900]   It's taken over your whole fucking life.
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:58.780]   But that's the conversation.
[02:31:58.780 --> 02:32:00.660]   Yeah, my dad beat me, but I'm fine now though.
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:01.820]   I'm good.
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:03.420]   Okay.
[02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:04.460]   All right.
[02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:06.780]   No, you ain't, you ain't fine.
[02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:07.620]   You ain't fine.
[02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:08.820]   This is, this is real talk.
[02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:10.020]   People don't want to have that.
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.460]   So your boy's right.
[02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:12.920]   100% right.
[02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:14.620]   Scary as shit.
[02:32:14.620 --> 02:32:17.180]   It's scary as shit.
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:19.540]   That makes you who you're supposed to be.
[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:22.600]   And that's the test.
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:25.400]   We forget, we think we're supposed to breathe air
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:28.920]   and have kids and pay the bills and shit.
[02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:32.020]   What's this life about?
[02:32:32.020 --> 02:32:33.100]   That ain't no sense.
[02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:36.960]   You're being tested, my friend.
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:40.980]   Tests come when you have not studied.
[02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:45.420]   Tests come when you think that you're in a great place.
[02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:46.540]   That's, that's the test.
[02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.700]   The test is every day of your life.
[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:51.280]   And most of us fail because we don't know why we're here.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:53.560]   'Cause we don't go inward to say, oh,
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:57.000]   you gave me a lot of shit to fix, man.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.400]   And this test sucks.
[02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:04.300]   But then you start.
[02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:09.220]   - David Goggins, I don't think I could add to that.
[02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:10.160]   I know I can't.
[02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:16.340]   Thank you for sharing what you shared today.
[02:33:16.340 --> 02:33:22.460]   I mean, as much as your process or anyone's process
[02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:27.980]   can't be completely understood from the outside,
[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:32.020]   you gave us a real window into this thing,
[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:37.020]   this process that you, as you said, God put it on you.
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:38.380]   I believe in God too.
[02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:39.460]   People can believe what they want,
[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:42.420]   but somehow your life,
[02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:45.320]   God gave you these challenges early on.
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:49.100]   And then there was a point where you went internal.
[02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:54.020]   And like you said, you developed a skill,
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:33:56.180]   but it's a perishable skill.
[02:33:56.180 --> 02:33:59.100]   And you clearly live in the process
[02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:03.040]   of opening those cupboards, reopening those cupboards,
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:04.780]   trying to spit shine those cupboards,
[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:08.540]   understanding that they're never ever really done,
[02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:11.060]   but that you can gain ground on them.
[02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:14.980]   You can win day after day after day.
[02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:17.080]   And you really shared a lot of concrete things
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:21.260]   that I think I know people are going to be able
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:23.280]   to apply if they choose.
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:24.120]   And I agree with you.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:27.520]   I think most people will be like, whoa, that was a lot.
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:28.360]   - Yep.
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:29.200]   - It's heavy.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.420]   I think I want to just kind of bake myself in Netflix
[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:36.120]   and Chex Mix instead.
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:41.840]   But there's also the reality that there are men and women,
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:45.320]   boys and girls who hear that and go, okay,
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:49.420]   and start cracking the cupboards open.
[02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:50.260]   - Right.
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:52.960]   - And I just know that, you know, for myself,
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.500]   I'm extremely grateful that you're willing
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:55.780]   to put it all out there.
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:35:00.340]   You're so brutally honest, so brutally authentic.
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:02.900]   That word authenticity gets thrown around so much.
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:07.380]   And I can tell you that for me and for everybody else,
[02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:09.140]   like that's what really what resonates.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:10.980]   So whether or not you want to,
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:13.840]   whether or not it's the purpose behind it or not,
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:15.580]   you're lighting the path.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:17.460]   So thank you.
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:18.380]   - Respect, thank you.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:19.680]   Thanks for having me.
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:21.500]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.020]   with David Goggins.

[02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:03.540]   Not on today's episode,
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:06.140]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:06.140 --> 02:36:07.800]   we discuss supplements.
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:09.920]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:12.200]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:13.580]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:15.700]   for hormone support and for focus.
[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:17.700]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:36:17.700 --> 02:36:19.180]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:21.540]   please go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:24.840]   So that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:26.980]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:29.660]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:31.820]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, X,
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:33.420]   LinkedIn and Facebook.
[02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:35.040]   And on all those platforms,
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:37.100]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:38.700]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:39.820]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:42.160]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.320]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:46.860]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:47.980]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:49.260]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:50.840]   I encourage you to do so.
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:52.420]   It is completely zero cost
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.020]   and it provides podcast summaries and protocols
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:58.380]   in the form of brief PDFs of one to three pages.
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:37:00.340]   Things like deliberate cold exposure,
[02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:02.900]   a protocol for foundational fitness,
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:05.020]   protocol for deliberate heat exposure,
[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:07.460]   for managing dopamine, for optimizing your sleep
[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:08.380]   and so on and so on.
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:09.620]   Again, completely zero cost.
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:12.760]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:15.380]   scroll down to newsletter and click on the newsletter tab
[02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:17.520]   and you enter your email to sign up.
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:18.360]   But I should point out
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:20.840]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:23.740]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:26.300]   with the one and only David Goggins.
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:28.420]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:30.340]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.920]   (upbeat music)
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:35.500]   (upbeat music)
