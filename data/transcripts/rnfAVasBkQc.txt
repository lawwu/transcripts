[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Roll the Dice or Go All the Way by Charles Bukowski.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.920]   If you're going to try, go all the way.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.120]   Otherwise, don't even start.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.160]   If you're going to try, go all the way.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.520]   This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.720]   jobs, and maybe your mind.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   Go all the way.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.160]   It could mean not eating for three or four days.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.360]   It could mean freezing on a park bench.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.720]   It can mean jail.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.640]   It can mean derision, mockery, isolation.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400]   Isolation is the gift.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.880]   All the others are a test of your endurance,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.160]   or how much you really want to do it.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.920]   And you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.160]   And it'll be better than anything you can imagine.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.280]   If you're going to try, go all the way.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   There's no other feeling like that.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.760]   You'll be alone with the gods, and the nights
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.440]   will flame with fire.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.640]   Do it.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920]   Do it.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.400]   All the way.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.440]   All the way.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.720]   You will ride life straight to perfect laughter.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.920]   It's the only good fight there is.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.760]   [THUD]
