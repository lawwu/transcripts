[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.120]   Our first question about the deep life comes from Joyce.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:19.200]   Joyce asks, "What do you do or read to inspire and remind yourself of the importance of living a deep life?"
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.520]   Well, Joyce, for me, I love encountering case studies.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.760]   Be it in magazine profiles, books, or videos, documentaries, etc.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.440]   Whatever the format, I love encountering case studies of people who are living deeply.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.960]   Seeing actual people doing this never fails to give me that hint of inspiration.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.040]   So, for example, my oldest boys and I like to watch videos of people that are in the maker community,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.240]   people who build things.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   And in particular, we like watching these videos.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.320]   I've mentioned this before on the podcast of Adam Savage, former host of The Mythbusters.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.240]   He has this massive—he calls it cave—it's actually a warehouse in the Mission District of San Francisco
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.360]   that's just full of tools and supplies, and in there he can build these elaborate things.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.120]   And there's a focus and craftsmanship to that that I think is really inspiring.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.360]   You can get this with athletic examples.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.760]   You know, I really like seeing people or examples of people whose life have been crafted around
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.480]   mastering a particular physical pursuit.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.600]   I like what Steve Ranella does on his Netflix show, Meat Eater, because it's very philosophical.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.880]   Ranella, in some sense, is an heir to the stylish show that Anthony Bourdain was doing.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.360]   It's not coincidental that Bourdain has been on or was on Ranella's show.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.800]   They go out there and do these long hunts.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.760]   Sometimes they are successful, sometimes they're not.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.760]   But they are shot elegiacally, beautiful, long form, long focus shots.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.080]   There is a very smart voiceover that Ranella does.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.120]   Ranella is a hunter, but he also writes for The New Yorker.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.160]   This is someone who knows how to think and write, so there's these really interesting,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.320]   insightful voiceovers with these beautiful shots.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.080]   And the whole thing is done in a world of depth.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   Just them alone, the mountains, in the plains, wherever they happen to be.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.240]   And there's something that's calming about that.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.040]   I wrote in Deep Work about being affected by watching the video of Rick Furrer, who
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.800]   is a old-time metalsmith.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.880]   So he does blacksmithing using old-time tools.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.840]   And he works out of a barn that's up there in Door County, near one of the Great Lakes.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.080]   And he throws the barn doors open and it overlooks a field.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.440]   And I watched a video of him building a Viking sword.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.320]   It was a Nova episode I came across it.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.360]   And again, something about that.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.920]   It's someone who's working deeply with great focus, mastery.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.080]   They're just doing one thing.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.640]   They're doing that thing well and deeply.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.520]   And just something about that hits a chord.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.640]   I actually heard from Rick after Deep Work came out.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.040]   We've had an interesting back-and-forth conversation, which I enjoyed.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.360]   Great pleasure of actually having some of this work out there in the public.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.160]   So that's what I would say.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.760]   I love to encounter real people living deeply.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   You know it when you see it.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.520]   It gives you that feel of inspiration or aspiration.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.440]   And that's a feel that we should take seriously.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.800]   What is it that I'm feeling?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.360]   What is it that is causing the sense of aspiration or inspiration in what I'm watching?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.680]   How can I isolate that?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.000]   How can I identify what it is that's causing that feeling?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.880]   And then once I've isolated those elements, I can then answer the question of,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.040]   how can I get more of that in my life?
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.560]   This is the type of investigation, question, asking, and answering
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.400]   I think more of us probably should be doing right now.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.200]   But in the meantime, though, it's an excuse to watch
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.880]   some of those fun, inspiring videos online.
