[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   A podcast listener named Melinda writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, what is the proper
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.600]   response of the Christian to all that's going on in Israel and Gaza?
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.020]   I have Christian friends praising Israel because they are God's people defeating their longtime
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.240]   enemies saying that all their offensives are justified and sanctioned by God because they
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.720]   are defending the land that He gave them.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.960]   I have other Christian friends who are outraged over Israel's slaughter of innocent civilians
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.680]   and children in Gaza and the support they receive from the United States.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.400]   Which is the right response?"
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.600]   Let's start with an overarching position on the conflict, and then I'll try to put some
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560]   Bible underneath it and explain.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.520]   And when I say conflict, I mean between the Jewish people, Israel, the state, and Jews
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.720]   as a body, and the Palestinians.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.280]   There are Jewish Christians and there are Palestinian Christians, and these Christians
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.080]   are the meek who will inherit the earth, including the land of Israel someday.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.000]   Jesus died to make peace between Jews and the nations.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.480]   That's the point of Ephesians 2, 11 following.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.000]   And therefore, our prayers and our labors should be devoted especially to heralding
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.320]   the gospel of Messiah Jesus as the only hope for long-term peace and justice among Jews
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.920]   and Palestinians.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.800]   That's the most important thing to say, I believe.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   And then I would say, the Bible does not teach that we should be partial to Israel or to
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.880]   the Palestinians in the present Christ-rejecting rebellion that both of them have against God.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   As if either of them had a divine right to the land of Israel in spite of their rebellion
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   and unbelief against their maker and their covenant God, which carries this implication.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   Both sides, Palestinians and Israel, should be treated with compassionate public justice
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.840]   in the same way that disputes are settled between nations generally, with a wise mingling
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.200]   of justice and mercy.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.680]   So that's my overarching position.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.160]   Neither Jews nor Palestinians can justify anything they do or be treated any particular
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.200]   way by virtue of claiming a present-day divine right to the land while they are living in
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.520]   rebellion against the one who made the land a gift of covenant keeping.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.400]   Now here's some biblical foundations for that.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.520]   Israel was chosen by God from all the peoples of the world to be the focus of his blessing
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.320]   in history of redemption.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   Amen to that.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.480]   This history climaxed in the coming and the death and resurrection of Jesus, the Messiah.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.440]   The Lord, your God, has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession out of
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.320]   all the peoples who are on the face of the earth, Deuteronomy 7, 6.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   Amen.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.800]   Israel is God's chosen people.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.960]   And not only that, God promised to Israel the present disputed land from the time of
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.040]   Abraham onward.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.200]   God said, Deuteronomy 34, 4, "This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   and to Jacob.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.920]   I will give it to your offspring."
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.880]   And it's repeated many times to that effect.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.040]   But neither of those two facts, Israel's election and God's covenant promise of the
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:02.240]   land, neither of those two facts means that Israel today has a present day divine right
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   to the land.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.040]   Now, why do I say that?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.280]   Because a non-covenant keeping people does not have a divine right to hold the land of
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   promise which was given by covenant.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.700]   Covenant breaking forfeits covenant privileges.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.260]   God said to Israel, "If you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.880]   my treasured possession among all the peoples."
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.680]   Today, Israel is a covenant breaking people.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.340]   There are thousands, I know, there are thousands of Messiah trusting Jews.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.760]   They are not covenant breaking.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.200]   They enjoy God's saving favor.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.440]   But as a whole, as an ethnic unity, as a state, they are defined by rejecting Messiah Jesus.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.880]   They are, because if they'd be Christian and they don't want to define themselves as Christian,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   that would make them Christian.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.840]   If they embraced Messiah Jesus as Messiah and Savior, they'd be Christian.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.020]   They are self-consciously not Christian.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.280]   They are in a state of treason against their king who sent his son to save them.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.640]   A people in treason against her king cannot lay legitimate claim on the king's promises
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.280]   to a covenant keeping people.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.240]   For example, when Israel was driven from the land of promise under God's judgment with
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.680]   the Babylonians, Daniel prayed like this, "Oh Lord, we have sinned and done wrong.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.400]   To you, oh Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us, open shame.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.000]   To all Israel, in all the lands to which you have driven them because of the treachery
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.840]   that they have committed against you."
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.000]   In other words, that's Daniel 9, 4-7.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.160]   In other words, God is righteous.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.760]   He says righteous to deny Israel her divine right to the land when she is a treasonous
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.840]   people against God.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.400]   Jesus stood with tears, looking out over Jerusalem and said, "Would that you had known the day
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.080]   of peace, but now they are hidden.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.000]   These things are hidden from your eyes.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   You did not know the time of your visitation."
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.480]   So they had rejected the cornerstone.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.640]   They still do.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.520]   And when they did that, Jesus said, "The kingdom will be taken away from you and given to a
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   people producing its fruits."
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.080]   Matthew 21-43.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.400]   And then he explained like this, Matthew 8-11, "Many will come from east and west and recline
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.240]   at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.440]   kingdom will be thrown into outer darkness."
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.440]   For now a hardening has come upon Israel.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.080]   These are the times of the Gentiles, the times of the nations, Luke 21-24.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.200]   But this hardening of Israel is not God's last word.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.960]   He has a saving purpose for Israel.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.120]   All Israel will someday turn to the Lord Christ as a group.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   This is my deep understanding and belief of Romans 11.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.880]   The broken off branches will be grafted in one day to the people of God, the bride of
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.040]   Christ, his church.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.080]   I think we should pray for that day.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080]   I do.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.640]   I pray, "Lord, bring the day when the hardening will be lifted from Israel.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.440]   Grant, oh God, that their eyes would be opened.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.440]   They would see Jesus as their Messiah and join the church of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:58.120]   And in one great tree of covenant love, may they be grafted into salvation."
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.120]   And we must be careful.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.040]   This may be a closing qualification here.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:12.080]   Careful not to draw false and unbiblical inferences from anything I've said, like, "Well, Israel's
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.000]   present rebellion against God means that the other nations have the right to molest her."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.880]   No, they don't.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:27.560]   She still has human rights among nations when she has no rights before God, just like all
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.000]   the nations do.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   We don't think any nation, because it's a pagan and unbelieving nation, should be treated
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   unjustly.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.640]   Neither should Israel.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   In the Old Testament, the nations that gloated over her divine discipline were punished by
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.040]   God, Isaiah 10.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:54.380]   So our plea as Christians to Palestinians and Jews is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.120]   you will be saved."
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:03.920]   And until that day, when both Jewish and Gentile followers of King Jesus inherit the earth,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.680]   not just the land, until that day when we together inherit the earth, without lifting
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.520]   a sword or without lifting a gun, the rights of nations should be decided by principles
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:24.320]   of compassionate public justice, not claims to divine right or divine status.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   Excellent.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.600]   And for an even fuller biblical and theological exploration of these themes, see Pastor John's
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.880]   sermon "Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East," which he preached on March 7th of 2004.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.120]   You can find that sermon and 1,200 others in the archive at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.440]   On this podcast, we talk a lot about sexual temptation and sexual sin, but what exactly
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   is lust?
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.240]   Tomorrow on the podcast, Pastor John will give us a foundational definition to help
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.080]   us understand the sin and what's underneath it.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.560]   We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   [END]
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   1
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.560]   Pastor John's Sermon on the "Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East" (Pastor John's Sermon)
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.240]   This concludes the meeting.
