[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai podcast where we try
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.920]   to help you achieve financial freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.100]   In this episode, we want to talk about a concept called a provider's clock for men.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.640]   Women can definitely have a provider's clock too, but I'm trying to think about it from
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.720]   a man's point of view because I'm a man and this is something that I came up with.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.160]   So what is a provider's clock?
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:45.240]   A provider's clock starts ticking as soon as a man's first born son or daughter is born.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:53.080]   And it keeps on ticking at least until the age of 18, but likely for 25, maybe 30 years
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.780]   until the father knows their child can be financially independent and stand on their
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.400]   own two feet or has found someone who loves them as much as he loves their children and
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.900]   can provide for them.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.620]   So that is my definition of a provider's clock.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.440]   And I liken the provider's clock to a woman's biological clock.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.260]   And the biological clock for a woman starts maybe teenage years, maybe after college where
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.400]   the woman might start thinking about having children up till the age of 45.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.760]   And when I say 45, because after 45, the chances of having a child naturally declines to less
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.680]   than 5%.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.640]   But really after 35, the chances of a woman conceiving and giving birth naturally starts
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.200]   really going down because of abnormalities in chromosomes.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.860]   It's just biology.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.280]   So that clock starts ticking and it gets louder and louder as that deadline comes and then
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.260]   it eventually fades.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.520]   What are your thoughts about these two types of clocks, the provider's clock and the biological
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   clock?
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.120]   Well, you're the first person I've come across to use the term provider's clock, so props
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.360]   to your originality.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.200]   And I think this topic that you've brought up is quite relatable for a lot of folks and
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   I think it makes for a great discussion.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   Alrighty.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.000]   Well, hopefully this concept of provider's clock resonates with all of y'all and it becomes
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.640]   a more popular term going forward because I think it's very important.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   I wanted to record this episode because I don't like feeling negativity and I don't
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.240]   really like judging people either.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.160]   I want people from all types to read Financial Samurai, share their perspectives in a respectful
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.340]   manner and feel welcome.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.760]   So this negative feeling started around 2005 when we moved into this other house in the
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.200]   Marina district on the north side of San Francisco.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   Across the street was a neighbor who threw parties.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.200]   His dad bought him the house while he was in law school.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.480]   So he was like, I don't know, 24, 25 years old and the house was bought for $1.8 million.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.520]   Pretty nice, right?
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.440]   He also drove an Audi S4, which at the time probably cost $40,000 to $50,000.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.200]   And we were hearing the noise and our bedroom was facing the front street facing their house.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.540]   And this is when I started getting annoyed because I needed to wake up at 5am, no later
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.440]   than 5.30am every single morning for my job.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.560]   And these guys are throwing parties every weekend or every other weekend and disturbing
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.720]   me.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.240]   And so that resentment, that anger, that negativity started boiling up in me because this guy
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.880]   was getting a free ride from the bank of mom and dad, whereas we had just purchased this
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   house.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   We went all in.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.120]   I saved a lot of money.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.640]   I took a lot of investment risks and I put down hundreds of thousands of dollars and
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.480]   took on this big mortgage.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.880]   So I had this huge responsibility.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.840]   I was more stressed than normal and I wasn't sleeping on the weekend sometimes because
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.760]   of the neighbor.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.240]   And so that resentment built.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.060]   Then in 2014, we bought a fixer in Golden Gate Heights, which is on the West side of
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.900]   San Francisco with some nice ocean views, really quiet, quaint neighborhood and my favorite
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.680]   neighborhood in all of San Francisco.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.400]   And that's when I met my other neighbor, a 24 year old son who was quite cold.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.320]   He took a long time to graduate college and he moved back in with his parents.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.960]   Every time I'd walk by him, he wouldn't say a thing.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.480]   He was really, really prickly.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.560]   And so I got to wondering, yo, what's, what's wrong with you?
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.800]   I'm just saying, hi, I'm just the friendly neighbor.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   What's up?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.000]   Well, 10 years later in 2024, he's still living at home with his parents.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.860]   His parents moved out, but the parents just let him stay at home.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.340]   So knowing this, I started feeling a little negative about him again, right?
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.440]   He was really not a nice guy, but here's this guy.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.200]   He went to college, his bank of mom and dad paid for his house again, and he was essentially
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.600]   living for free.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.000]   So I've noticed a lot of this happening, particularly for men, where the parents take
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.500]   care of the men and the men stay at home with their parents.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.680]   And I know San Francisco home prices are higher than normal, so this is pretty common.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.300]   But I don't see a lot of women living at home with their parents.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.400]   They are either independent or they're living with their partner.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.180]   And then in 2017, we had our first child, a beautiful baby boy.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.920]   And all this worry kind of came back to me during the middle of the night, you know,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.800]   when I was rocking him to sleep or singing him to sleep.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.160]   Will our son turn out to be like one of these entitled boys who are cold and prickly and
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.040]   don't care about their neighbors?
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.600]   That's when it hit me.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.540]   I was like, what is going on with some of the men in our society?
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.880]   And there's this book out there.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.320]   I think Richard Reeves, he wrote a book called Of Boys to Men, and it talks about the problems
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.720]   more and more young men face in society.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.320]   And I started to get word.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.220]   And then as one of the pioneers of the modern day fire movement, when I started writing
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.960]   about reaching financial independence and retiring early in 2009 with the launch of
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.480]   Financial Samurai, I have noticed over the past four or five years, maybe the past three
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.800]   years in particular, more and more men claim they are financially independent while they
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.040]   have working spouses, working wives.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.920]   And some blogging friends I know retired 12 years ago and their wives are still working
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.660]   even though they don't want to work.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.860]   And no woman who is a stay at home parent, stay at home mom, has ever said that they
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.780]   are retired.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.680]   And so I was just very curious about why there's such this difference.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.300]   And I didn't feel as much respect and love for these men who claim they're financially
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.940]   independent while their wives continue to work and make hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.600]   and earn retirement benefits and pay for healthcare benefits.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.140]   And I think part of the reason why is because our situation is not like that.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.420]   We both don't have traditional day jobs and I feel a lot of pressure to be a stay at home
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.100]   father and to make sure our finances are okay.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.300]   So this is why.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.580]   This is kind of like my therapy session to try to understand why I've been feeling this
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.380]   type of growing negativity towards men who are still living at home with their parents.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.380]   What does it matter to me?
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.300]   It shouldn't bother me at all.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   But once I had my son, those worries started creeping in because I know, for example, the
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.340]   men who claim financial independence while depending on their working wives are actually
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.540]   secretly a little bit perturbed and they're a little bit maybe embarrassed that they can't
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.020]   let their wives enjoy the freedom they have as well.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.080]   And maybe they're a little bit embarrassed because they can't cut it in the workplace
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   anymore.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.180]   Hey, I couldn't cut it in the workplace anymore after 13 years.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.180]   I was burned out.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.260]   I said forget about it.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.740]   So I understand that.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.540]   At the end of the day, we're just fooling ourselves if we're saying we're financially
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.660]   good while we're depending on our spouses.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.900]   So Cindy, do you have a biological clock?
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.140]   And if you do have a biological clock, when do you think that clock started ticking?
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.300]   That's a good question.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.420]   It's hard for me to say exactly when I first started to feel anxious about having kids.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:56.580]   But I will say when I was in my 20s and even in my early 30s, I went through a period where
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:02.020]   I wasn't sure if I felt confident about having kids at all.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.740]   And I think this was because it just seemed like such a foreign concept to me initially
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.740]   and not something I felt ready to grapple with because I was so focused on my career
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   for so long and I was struggling a lot with work like balance and I just didn't know that
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.980]   I could take anything else on.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:26.220]   But I would say that once I hit my mid-30s, that's when I really felt like, okay, I do
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.540]   want to have kids.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.100]   And you were also on the same page at that point and I felt mature enough, I felt that
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.660]   I had gone far enough in my career, I felt we were financially stable and secure and
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.720]   I was really ready for a lifestyle change.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.580]   You were feeling okay starting in your mid-30s, but I would say that that is pretty late.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.980]   It may sound late, but for San Francisco, that's actually very common.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:10:01.300]   A lot of moms that I know also had kids late compared to the rest of the country at least.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.260]   I think there's been a shift in our country as a whole with more couples getting married
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.820]   later and then also naturally having children later.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.420]   I think cost has a lot to do with it, lifestyle has a lot to do with it, juggling so many
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.420]   things.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:25.660]   For me, I felt like I needed to be on a career path with a real clear trajectory at the age
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.660]   of 30.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:32.500]   I didn't have time for kids and then I remember my friend who I worked with at Golden Saks,
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.740]   he went to Yale, he grew up quite privileged and now he's at a hedge fund and he said,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.540]   "I'm not having kids until I have a million-dollar net worth."
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.340]   And I was thinking to myself, okay, million-dollar net worth sounds like a good target.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.860]   I didn't know better when I was in my 20s.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:53.500]   I was 22 to 24 at the time when I worked at Goldman and I thought, okay, it stuck with
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.260]   me ever since.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.020]   For me, I've always thought by age 30, you need to be someone in your career and then
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.260]   have a million-dollar net worth to have kids.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.940]   Now that I'm 46, I think to myself, well, obviously that's unnecessary to have a million-dollar
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.940]   net worth.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.940]   The majority of Americans don't wait until they have a million-dollar net worth to have
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:18.140]   kids but here I was living in Manhattan and then San Francisco where the median home price
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.860]   is $1.7 million now and I was thinking to myself, well, that kind of makes sense.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.020]   Did you have any kind of financial goals before or career goals before wanting to have kids?
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:36.220]   I didn't have as specific goals as you did but I did want to get to a certain point in
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:43.700]   my career which I managed to do and I also wanted to feel that we were stable and also
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:50.180]   emotionally ready because it's a big step in life and in marriage and I didn't want
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.060]   to commit to having a family until we both felt ready.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.540]   The problem with that though is going back to the biological clock.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:06.200]   If you look at the data, having kids for women after age 35 becomes increasingly more difficult
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:13.500]   for natural conception and then once you hit 45, basically there's almost no chance to
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.500]   conceive naturally.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   Did you ever feel that pressure or did you know those statistics when you were in your
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.340]   earlier 30s or mid-30s?
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:29.380]   I think I started to look at it when I crossed over 30 and yeah, it's a lot to take in.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:36.440]   I think a lot of couples feel concerned about whether having a family will be possible for
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.360]   them because it frankly doesn't always happen when you want it to.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   No.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.400]   I just feel that so much planning actually needs to be involved in order for couples
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.000]   nowadays to have children, especially couples who live in very expensive cities like San
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.560]   Francisco, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington DC and so forth.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.520]   If you wait too long and if you don't plan well enough, I think it's going to be hard
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.360]   for a lot of folks who are waiting after age 35 for women that is.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.280]   Do you have friends or colleagues who just couldn't have children because they waited
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.320]   too long or they had to go the IVF route?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.240]   Yeah, I do.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.960]   Some of them were younger.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.960]   Some of them were older.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.040]   Even if you're in your 20s, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be able to have a baby
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.560]   right away.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.620]   Getting pregnant is harder than most people realize until they're actually trying to start
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.440]   a family and it's emotional.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.800]   It's emotional for both sides.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:46.360]   Fortunately, something that more and more people are opening up to talking about and
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.560]   this greater awareness I think will help more people plan as the younger generations are
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.560]   growing up.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:14:00.200]   Yeah, I think family planning is just as important if not more important than financial planning
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   because biology, it's either going to cooperate or it's not going to cooperate.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.760]   Whereas financial planning, you know that if you save an X amount of money over a Y
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:16.320]   period of time with a Z percentage return, compound annual return, you're going to get
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:24.280]   to a financial figure that will make you happy and make you financially independent or not.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:32.200]   Whereas with family planning, you got to meet the right person, you got to get married,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.680]   you got to live your life before having children, then you have children and you got to calculate
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   how many years between if you want X number of children and then you got to pay for the
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.420]   children.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.440]   For those of you who are younger, who are newlyweds or new couples thinking about starting
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.720]   a family, you've got to plan.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.760]   You've got to plan carefully and you have to have different scenarios just like financial
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   planning.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.360]   Now, I want to turn back to this idea of the provider's clock for men which is like the
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:08.160]   biological clock for women because I feel, correct me if I'm wrong, the biological clock
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:15.260]   for women could last maybe 30 years, maybe let's say from age 15 to 45 and I use 45 because
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.420]   after 45, it's almost impossible to conceive naturally.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.500]   Do you think 30 years is a reasonable amount of time?
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:28.040]   I mean obviously, it's there, the clock starts but I would say a lot of women probably aren't
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:35.420]   thinking about it until mid-20s, late-20s but again, it depends on when you meet someone,
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.380]   when you settle down, where you are with your career, it can be all over the place frankly.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:47.620]   But let's say mid-20s, so 25, so 25 to 45, so 20 year ticking biological clock.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:55.060]   Now, so for men, the provider's clock starts with the birth of your son or daughter and
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:03.060]   then it ends, it has to end at least at the earliest at age 18 I would say because that's
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:10.220]   technical adulthood and maybe up until age, after 25 years maybe or 30 years or whatever
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.820]   that time period is when your child is financially independent.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.040]   What do you think about that concept of the provider's clock and that time frame?
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.820]   I think that all makes sense.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.820]   Okay.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:31.540]   Well, I have realized, I feel that the desire for a man to provide for his family is innate,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:39.100]   it's biological, it's part of evolution to allow our species to survive over the years
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.820]   and of course, women have a provider's clock as well.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.620]   I'm just looking at it from a male's point of view, a man's point of view where I was
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.080]   perplexed.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:55.980]   I was perplexed for the longest time of why I felt like, "Man, you're 35 years old and
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.020]   you're still living at home with your parents.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:02.980]   I've got literally, we've got what, 5, 6 male neighbors who are still living at home with
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:08.620]   their parents in their late 20s and 30s and I was thinking to myself, "Yo, let's get on
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.700]   with it.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.540]   Your life is ticking by.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.900]   Let's try to be independent.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.300]   Go live on your friend's couch if you need to but try to get out and launch.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.620]   Otherwise, life is going to pass you by."
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.180]   I think it's harder to find someone if you're living at home with mom and dad and I think
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.860]   it's hard to impress someone if you're still living at home with mom and dad in your mid-30s
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.860]   for example.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.980]   Now, this is judgmental thinking and this is why I wanted to change and so I realized
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:47.820]   to overcome my lack of admiration for men who don't provide in terms of financially,
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.180]   I realized, "Ah, it's biological."
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.300]   In the sense that some people have louder provider's clocks than others.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:02.800]   So if you have a really loud provider's clock that's wound up, you're going to want to work
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.260]   and produce for society and do something meaningful and productive probably for the rest of your
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.900]   life no matter how rich you get.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:16.780]   And if you have a quiet provider's clock, you'd be willing to, maybe you'd work hard
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.740]   in the beginning but then you'd be willing to just check out earlier, retire earlier
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:28.260]   as they say, and let your wife be the primary breadwinner which is totally fine and that's
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:34.020]   my realization that everybody is wired differently because genetics is different for everybody.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:42.740]   Yes, I can totally see how everybody is wired differently and the level of desire that each
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.020]   person has in terms of how much they want to work and provide, it's going to be different.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.540]   And I just realized something, so for our daughter and actually for our son, I think
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.060]   it's important if you're going to be with someone, if you're going to commit to someone
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:04.780]   in a committed relationship, marry them, whatnot, is to find out how strong is their biological
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.480]   clock and their provider's clock.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:14.260]   So let's say our daughter finds someone in the future and they have a very weak or soft
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.620]   provider's clock.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.180]   It's important for her to know this because that means that she will likely have to work
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.540]   hard for a longer period of time, right?
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.580]   And so if that's the case, she needs to be okay with that, to be with someone with a
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.460]   quiet provider's clock.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.980]   And I do think it's important to have as many serious conversations before getting married
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.500]   as possible about what both partners want in the future.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.740]   If one person is adamant about not having children and the other person really wants
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.460]   to have children, they need to have some serious conversations about whether or not they're
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.420]   going to be compatible long term.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:57.220]   And the other thing is, if you want to retire early in your career, like you already know
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.540]   this, right?
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.380]   You need to find someone with a very loud provider's clock.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:10.460]   Someone who maybe grew up poor or who faced a lot of discipline and struggle in their
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:16.420]   childhood where they need to prove to their parents that they can be on their own.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.180]   And so it's almost like you have to really strategically think about how strong someone's
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.340]   drive is if you are thinking about taking it easier, right?
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.380]   Because strategically, we know some people marry rich so they don't have to grind it
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:36.580]   out, whereas some people are fine to be independent and grind as long as possible because they
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   have that strong provider's clock.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:43.660]   So something to think about and teach our children about that both biological clock
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.660]   and provider's clock going forward.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:51.220]   Alrighty, folks, we hope you enjoyed this discussion about biology and the provider's
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.220]   clock.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.900]   If you ever encounter someone that bothers you, that does something that you wouldn't
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.300]   do, that makes you mad, maybe angry, maybe miffed, just think about how biology affects
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   us.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:12.740]   I think biology is probably the majority of how we think, our personalities, how we act.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.140]   The majority means 50.1%, right?
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:21.180]   I think biology probably governs maybe 70% of who we are and the rest is the environment,
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.380]   how we were raised, how we were taught.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.060]   So in other words, a lot of us just can't help the way we are.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.860]   Some of us have more positive demeanors.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:38.380]   Some of us are nicer, more patient, have better charisma, laugh more, or some of us are sulkier,
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.060]   you know, Debbie Downers, whatever it is.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.760]   And we should try to step back next time we see someone we don't like or something and
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.140]   try to understand what is it exactly that's bothering us.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:58.340]   And maybe the reality is they just are who they are and we have to accept them for who
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.340]   they are.
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.420]   And if they're not doing anything negatively to affect us, then we should just let them
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.860]   be and stop judging.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.680]   Thanks everyone for listening.
