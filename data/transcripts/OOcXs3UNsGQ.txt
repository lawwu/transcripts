[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Welcome back to the podcast. Recently we've been talking about how we serve and praise God.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   A week ago we looked at what it means to serve God, one of the most important questions a Christian can ask,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Pastor John said, and that was back in EBJ 1956.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And that led to the question, "What do we offer God as we serve Him? Does He need us?"
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And the answer to that question was, "No, He does not need us. We meet no need in Him."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   So then, what do we offer Him as we serve Him? It's another essential question to resolve,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and that was last time in EBJ 1957.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Today we look at praise, but a different kind of praise than what we've been talking about on the podcast recently.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Today we're talking about praise in the context of celebrating one another.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   How do we celebrate one another authentically and do so without flattery, which is a sin?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Today's question is from Sarah, a listener who writes us this,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   "Pastor John, hello. Can you explain to me the difference between flattery and encouragement?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We are called to encourage one another, but also to not puff one another up in pride.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   How can I know which one is which?"
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   There is such a thing as flattery. Not all getting is good, so we have the word greed, right?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And not all giving is good, so we have the word bribe.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Praise, which involves both getting and giving, may not be good, and so we have the word flattery.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   The Greek word for flattery, kolikia, occurs one time in the New Testament.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Paul is defending his ministry to the Thessalonians, and he says,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "We never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others."
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And it's, I think, more than coincidental that flattery occurs in that sentence with the word greed.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   In other words, I want something from you.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You're kind of getting at the heart of flattery when you think about that.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   The idea of flattery is present, without the word, in Jude 1:16,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   where Jude accuses certain men of admiring persons for the sake of their own advantage.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That's the idea. You're admiring and you're saying nice things about somebody for the sake of your own advantage.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Now, lots more is said about flattery in the Old Testament than in the New.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The word flattery is built on the Hebrew word for smooth or slippery.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So, a person who flatters is smoothing and caressing.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   "The lips of an adulteress drip honey, and smoother than oil is her speech," or that's Proverbs 5:3.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Here's 721. "With her many persuasions she entices him, and with her flattering lips she seduces him."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   The most general statement about flattery in its destructive effects is Proverbs 26-28.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   "A flattering mouth works ruin," or Proverbs 29-5.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   A man who flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his steps.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So, the key question becomes, how can we celebrate or praise good things about another person
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   without spreading a net for their feet or working their ruin?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I think the key is to keep in mind the essential difference between good praise and bad flattery.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Flattery is bad because it's calculated.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's given with a view to obtaining some advantage, Jude 1:16.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Flattery may be true, it may be not true.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Sometimes people think it has to do with whether it's true or not.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   That's not the issue. You may be saying something true about somebody and still be flattering.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's not the issue.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   The issue is whether it's calculated to achieve some purpose that is not rooted in the authentic,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   spontaneous delight that we take in the virtue we are praising.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   In other words, the key mark of genuine, non-flattering praise is that it's the overflow of authentic delight
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   in what we're observing about the other person.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's the opposite of calculation. It's spontaneous.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Lewis, C.S. Lewis, one of my favorite quotes, he says,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   "We delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not only expresses but completes the enjoyment.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It is its appointed consummation."
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yes, exactly right.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But flattery does not flow from a sincere delight in the thing being praised.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It's all external and manipulative.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's elicited out of us by some other benefit that we're hoping to get through the flattery,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   not by the benefit that we just got from the person's kindness or virtue or beauty or accomplishment.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So flattery is a form of hypocrisy.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   We try to give the impression that we are being moved by a spontaneous delight in something we admire,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   but we're not really being moved by spontaneous admiration.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   We're being calculating and we're desiring to use praise to get something.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I think the very phrase "use praise" makes me gag.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Like, you're going to go to God and use praise?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Ick! You know, it's a horrible way to think, and it's pretty prevalent today.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So this raises the question of whether it's appropriate to "use praise"
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   as a means of bringing about behaviors in children or employees or friends.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Doesn't that imply some kind of calculated use of praise for ulterior motives?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And that's a tough question.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I think the answer goes something like this.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   If the praise can still be an expression of authentic, spontaneous delight in some good that we have observed,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and if our goal is that the child or the friend do more of that behavior,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   not for the sake of praise, but because it's intrinsically beautiful in God honoring,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   then it's legitimate to hope that our praise will produce more good behavior.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But in general, I think it's dangerous to think of our praise of others,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   including our children, in utilitarian terms.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Children are going to catch on to this eventually.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   They're going to say, "I don't think Daddy really enjoyed what I just did.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   He's just trying to use it to get me to do something."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Namely, thinking that our praise will bring about behaviors that we want,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   that kids are going to catch on to that.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It's not going to be authentic.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Our parents are going to start thinking like psychologically trained manipulators.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Far better to be the kind of person, the kind of parent,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   who sees God-given virtue or God-given achievements and being so authentically stirred
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   with admiration and joy that we spill over with praise.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And of course, it's going to have wonderful effects on our relationships
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and on the future behaviors of our kids and others.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But if we start making the utilitarian dimension of praise prominent,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   which it is being made prominent today, if we start making it prominent,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   it will cease to be authentic, and in the long run, I think it will backfire.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Just one last help.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I have friends who have taught me that a good way to conceive of our praising
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   other people is to think of it as drawing attention, spontaneously enjoying
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and thus drawing attention to "evidences of God's grace."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   That little phrase is pretty common in some circles, and I think it's a good one.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   If we believe that in sinful human beings, all virtue is ultimately from God,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   which it is, then all praising of true virtue or true accomplishments
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   or any beautiful traits that we see will be conceived of as honoring God,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   not just man.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So it is a good thing in a family, in a church, among friends,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   to habitually call attention to "evidences of grace" in each other's lives,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   to say to our children in a dozen ways--don't have to be mechanical about this--
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   in a dozen ways, "I love what God is doing in your life.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   That was so good of the way you shared your toys with Jimmy."
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Kids aren't going to think, "Oh, Daddy's preaching."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Not if it's authentic. Not if it's authentic and you really feel joy
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   in what your child just did and joy in the grace of God.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   But my earnest plea--last thing I'll say--my earnest plea is try to avoid
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   utilitarian, calculated approaches which turn spontaneity into manipulation.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   That's the soil of flattery.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   A wonderful definition of flattery and how to avoid it in our hearts
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and a great little primer on pointing out evidences of grace in each other's lives.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for joining us today.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email your question to us at
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Well, the Bible says Christians have been saved, and it says we will be saved,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   and it says we are being saved right now.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   We are being saved. We're going to look at that last one,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   the present tense "being saved" next time.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   How are we being saved right now?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's the question. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   We'll find out on Monday. We'll see you then.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   [end]
