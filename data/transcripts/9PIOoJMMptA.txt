[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   When it's quiet, that's when it hits you.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.960]   That's what I think that's what a lot of people experience
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.060]   when they come back from a conflict zone.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.480]   Everything that was life and death,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.120]   everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos,
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.280]   all the people that are around you that would die for you,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.600]   kill for you, you would kill for them.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.840]   All the millions of dollars worth of equipment
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.360]   and stuff like that you were responsible for
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.560]   now are all gone and it's just you.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.320]   - The following is a conversation with Ed Calderon,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   a security specialist who has worked for many years
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.840]   on counter narcotics and organized crime investigation
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.600]   in the Northern border region of Mexico.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   I highly recommend you follow the writing and courses
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.040]   on his Patreon and website, edsmanifesto.com.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.040]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.040]   in the description.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.520]   And now, dear friends, here's Ed Calderon.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520]   What does your experience in counter narcotics,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.560]   investigating the Mexican drug cartel,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.720]   teach you about human nature?
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800]   - Wow, I mean, first off, anybody can be got.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.140]   Anybody can be corrupted.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.120]   You know, you work in that field and you,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.340]   realistically, the training we got and profiling
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240]   and investigation and stuff like that was basically
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.320]   you learn from the older guys there.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080]   And some of those guys were already corrupted
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.360]   from the start.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.960]   So trust no one.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.320]   I remember seeing that X-Files episode where that was stated.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.260]   You quickly learn that even if you are somebody
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.480]   that to your own mind appears incorruptible,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   you know, small changes happen around you,
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.880]   wheels get greased, money gets put in front of you
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.160]   and or things get threatened like your life.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.960]   And sometimes a payment for some of this corruption
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.040]   is just to continue on living.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.240]   You encounter people that seem incorruptible,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.800]   that go through FBI background checks,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.680]   that go through all of the security measures
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.120]   that all of us were put through, you know, polygraph test.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   And then later on, you know,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.880]   it turns out they were on the take
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.120]   or they became somebody that was corrupted.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.520]   I think what I found out is that anybody at any level,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.040]   they could be a very strong, hard to get person right now,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   but people get corrupted through their families.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.800]   Through need.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.160]   Mexico is a place where a lot of instability occurs.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.260]   So financial needs, health.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.780]   - So a crack could form through the wall of integrity
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.200]   and then over time it seeps in somehow.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.040]   - Mexico has a culture of corruption.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.480]   Like, you know, you have your kid that goes to school,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.660]   at public school and you want him to be in the morning,
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.800]   not in the afternoon school time period.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.540]   So you go off and grease the wheels
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.520]   with the director of the school.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.800]   People hearing this in Mexico will nod their heads
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   because this is something that happens from early on.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.240]   So there's a systemic and cultural thing to it,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.880]   you know, as far as getting around rules.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.360]   And this happens because, you know,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.200]   the people that are in charge in Mexico, the government,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.440]   is, you know, their tandem amount is trust
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.240]   between criminals and the cartels down there
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.160]   for a lot of the culture.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.440]   So people don't trust the government
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.980]   and much less criminality, so.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.080]   - When you meet a person sticking on human nature,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.580]   do you think it's possible to figure out
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.820]   if they can be trusted?
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.340]   So you said anyone can be corrupted.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.160]   You know, how long would you need to talk to a person?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.800]   And even in your own personal, private life, just a friend.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.340]   Or is trust a thing that's never really guaranteed?
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.520]   - I think that trust is never really guaranteed.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.760]   I know a lot of people are gonna say
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.040]   that's a sad way and hard way of living your life,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.080]   but, you know, life experience at my end,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.800]   you know, people change.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.680]   You know, the dynamics of a relationship might change.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.160]   I look at people's character,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.480]   specifically their past and past experiences if I can.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.640]   Somebody that presents himself in front of you as somebody,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.840]   but you quickly learn that that somebody
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.440]   is just a mask or a persona
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.920]   that they kind of created for themselves.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.880]   - And they might not even be aware of the persona.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.680]   Like, is there some deep psychological stuff?
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   - Sometimes.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.320]   I've experienced a lot of failure in my life.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.640]   You can see it in my nose.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.320]   You know, you can see it in my lack of a digit, you know.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.680]   The amount of, you know, the amount of failures
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.400]   you can see in somebody and how they wear them
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.940]   sometimes is a pretty telling thing
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.160]   as far as them being able to be trusted
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.880]   or that you can trust their story or their experience.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.360]   And when I say experience, I mean,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   I've met some criminals, like former criminals,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.880]   or, you know, some people of that background
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.840]   that I trust with my life, you know,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.680]   because they're not reformed,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.960]   but they figured out that that's not a life
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.360]   that can live long enough to kind of continue on.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.240]   And I've also met people that are in law enforcement
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.000]   that I wouldn't trust with my car keys, you know,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.040]   because, you know, whatever persona they adopted
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.060]   over the years is a pretty good one, pretty good mask.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.280]   Sometimes such a good mask,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.640]   they don't even know they're wearing it.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.760]   - And on top of that, it's not just the psychology.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.120]   There's also a neurobiology to it.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.760]   I've been very fortunate and deliberate
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.440]   to surround myself with good people throughout my life,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.840]   but I've recently gotten to sort of observe,
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.500]   not close to me, but nearby,
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.560]   somebody that could be classified as a sociopath
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.160]   and a narcissist.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.380]   Like, I don't wanna use those psychological terms,
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.840]   but just, it's like, oh, people, you know,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.920]   come with different biology, too.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.720]   So it's not just like the trauma you might experience
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.020]   in your early life and all the deep complexity that leads,
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.980]   all the deep complexity that leads to the psychology
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.400]   that you have as an adult,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.360]   but it's also the biology you come with, the nature,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.400]   that you might not just have the machine
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.420]   that can empathize deeply with the experience of others,
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.760]   or maybe a machine that gets off, gets a dopamine rush
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.280]   from the manipulation of other humans
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.520]   or the control of other humans.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.280]   - Yeah, I mean, put an example of my own background.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   My mom didn't have a father, you know?
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.220]   He left really early on in their childhood.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.860]   You know, my mom raised her two sisters
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.660]   and basically kept a household.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.640]   She was a great mom.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.820]   She was a badass, you know, she was very independent.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.140]   She showed me how to be independent.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.380]   She showed me how to kind of watch out for others
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.580]   and kind of build me up in that way.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.780]   And I had a great childhood as far as, you know,
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.380]   as far as her and kind of like how she molded me.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.720]   Later on, I figured out that when I had my own kid,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.520]   you know, I figured out that she was basically
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.040]   trying to make me into what she didn't have in a way.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.680]   And if I can get to see somebody's parents, you know,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.160]   that's usually a sign of something, at least for me,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.320]   as far as figuring out where people are.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.640]   I think there's something to be said
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.920]   about nature and nurture.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.680]   And now some people come up,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.640]   some people are just born with that predatory instinct,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.600]   you know, and you'll never know.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.920]   I mean, they spend their whole life
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.220]   practicing how to hide it.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.680]   But if you can figure out somebody's, you know,
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.280]   background, childhood, where they're from,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.120]   you can kind of tell something about them.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.640]   You know, I'm from Tijuana, you know, I'm a survivor.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.940]   That's my background as far as where I'm from.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.280]   - Culturally, genetically, psychologically,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.560]   the full shebang.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.480]   - Yeah, I guess some people are born
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.520]   with certain predispositions.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.400]   And if they're in the right environment,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.200]   some of the negative aspects might flourish
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.560]   more than others, you know.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.080]   For me, I mean, I grew up skateboarding in Tijuana.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.400]   And I remember breaking into my first backyard pool.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.560]   It was a house that a cartel guy owned,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   and we used to skate the pool in the back of it.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.980]   So I learned how to pop open padlocks
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.140]   with a small vehicle hydraulic lift.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.440]   And I remember doing that.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.320]   And later on in life, I got to train with people
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.800]   from other parts of Mexico.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.000]   And work with them.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.580]   And I remember pulling that trick off,
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.960]   and they were like looking at me like,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.560]   "Where'd you learn that?"
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.640]   Like, "Some burglars in Tijuana."
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.400]   You know, and they're like, "Wow, that's interesting.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.280]   "Like, are all people from Tijuana like that?"
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   And I said, "No, we're not all like that.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.840]   "But I guess in some way we are."
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.320]   Because, you know, Tijuana produces kids like that.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   You know, she produces, like the environment itself,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.240]   produces a pretty specific person, I guess.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.160]   You know, our normal or our baseline normal
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.480]   is way different than most.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.000]   - The trajectories that you can take in life
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.960]   are defined in a way that aren't available
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.200]   elsewhere in the world.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.040]   - Yeah.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.320]   - And so you develop, I mean, part of that's psychological,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.080]   part of that is cultural and so on.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   Part of that is the cultural trauma.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.360]   But then also the ethical lines based on the corruption.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840]   'Cause I grew up in the Soviet Union,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.800]   there's the same kind of understanding
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.720]   that there's some gray area of corruption.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.680]   - Yeah, it's always there, like on the outskirts
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.400]   or even in the center.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.040]   How you can grease things to make things easier
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.080]   and how it's like a personal thing.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.880]   I'll just, you know, pay off the,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.200]   in Tijuana we have a mordida is what we call it.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.320]   You know, when you pay a cop off.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   Una mordida means a bite.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   So, and--
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.880]   - But what's the bite aspect?
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.160]   - So you get stopped for a traffic violation of some sort
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.640]   and the cop walks up to you.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.920]   Obviously you don't say the word bite,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.480]   but it's like a slang term for it.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.560]   And he asked for your paperwork and, you know,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.040]   and if you get fined or get a ticket,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.160]   you say, "Can I pay the ticket here?"
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.920]   Is what they say.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.960]   And, you know, put your money inside of the paperwork
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.000]   and hand it over to the cop.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.840]   Mordida, you think it's, you know,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.240]   I'm just gonna do it and nobody knows, you know,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.280]   but it's a systemic thing.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.760]   Everybody, like a lot of people do it.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.120]   And then they don't trust the police
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.040]   because they are fed with this.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.440]   - Yeah, I mean, same thing was in the Soviet Union.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.280]   It's funny.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.840]   But then there's something inside you
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.640]   where that kind of, those opportunities come,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.120]   like with a police officer,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.400]   where you realize you could just pay a little bit of money
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.720]   and get out of a thing.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.760]   And then you realize you can pay a little bit of money
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.480]   or do a favor to get your kids in a better school
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   or something like that.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.080]   But there comes opportunities where you,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.320]   where, all right, if I do this little thing,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.120]   I can make, I can get a huge promotion
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.200]   or I can get a huge increase in my power
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.680]   or get a lot of money.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.840]   And something inside you says, no, that's not right.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.480]   And I wonder what that is.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.920]   'Cause like, yeah, 'cause it feels different
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.720]   than the legal systems within which you operate.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   There's some kind of basic human integrity, human decency.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.960]   I wonder if that's like constructed or it's always there.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.240]   If it's like, again, nature versus nurture.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.000]   - Yeah, I think, for me, it was looking at,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.760]   at seeing that in somebody else
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.000]   that I kind of learned about it.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.080]   There's a man that I consider a mentor figure.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.400]   His name's Lieutenant Colonel Lee Zelda.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.120]   He was a lieutenant colonel from the army
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.040]   that basically came over and took over the group
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.700]   that I used to work with.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.720]   He was incorruptible.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   He was, that was the essence or the aura that he projected.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.160]   The first time he went off on patrol
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.640]   when he was placed in charge of us,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.780]   I actually drove him around Tijuana.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.580]   He was one of those lead from the front type of people.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.520]   The amount of assassination attempts he got
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.320]   that was basically a proof of how uncorruptible he was
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.880]   because they kept trying to pay him off.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.840]   And when that didn't work,
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.160]   they tried to kill him several times.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.840]   I think the last assassination attempt
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.760]   took the use of his legs.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.480]   And that man is still a dangerous person in my mind.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.760]   But for me, and people can gather a little bit
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.520]   about my background and where I'm from
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.920]   and some of the access I currently have
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.240]   to train the federal institutions here in the US
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   as far as my background and if I was corrupted or not,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.200]   because there's a lot of that out there.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.600]   The Catholic guilt that's kind of built into some of us
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   is always kind of there.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.620]   The devil was under the bed.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.200]   So I don't consider myself Catholic,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.280]   consider myself culturally Catholic, I think,
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.880]   is what I kind of say with that.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.920]   I had a pretty good structure with my dad and my mom
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.800]   at the house and they never let me get away with things.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.820]   And I think my mom was a pretty big moral compass for me.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.960]   But Lieutenant Colonel kind of leading from example
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.760]   and seeing his work and how much profound change he caused
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.520]   in the people that work with him as far as,
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.640]   we felt supported and we felt like we had a guiding figure
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.580]   during this.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.440]   Tijuana was the most dangerous city on the planet
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.640]   when I was working there and he took charge.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.880]   - What does it take to be a man, the Lieutenant Colonel,
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.740]   who maintains integrity after assassination attempts?
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.240]   Is it possible for a normal human to do that?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.560]   Or again, is it genetic?
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.800]   - That's an interesting question.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.280]   I'll say this, seeing him,
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.640]   I mean, the last assassination attempt he had,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.000]   they took use of his legs, he was with his kid.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.160]   There was a recklessness to it.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.040]   I can see that now,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.920]   like now that I have enough distance from it,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.640]   I could see that there's a recklessness to being that way.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.960]   And also you're putting jeopardy people around you
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.020]   if you take that route.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.540]   So I think there's a sacrifice to it,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.720]   a very powerful and hard one to make for a lot of people.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.480]   For me, it was, I wouldn't get picked to get
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   on board with some of the operations groups
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.320]   that I wanted to work with because I was known
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.280]   for not taking money or not being trusted
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.240]   by certain older segments of the organization
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.640]   that I was with, with stuff,
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.680]   because they knew that I wouldn't,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.040]   I wasn't on the, I wouldn't get money.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.760]   So there's always a weird sacrifice to it.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.240]   And you're almost kind of like masochistic in that way
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.640]   when you get approached with it,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.560]   they're like, "Why are you being an idiot?
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.160]   Why are you driving around that beat up car?
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.400]   Look at the Hummer H2 that just drove in
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.360]   with the other guy that is doing exactly your same job."
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.800]   Society as a whole down there doesn't reward it,
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.360]   or at least doesn't see it in the people
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.160]   that don't take that route in Mexico.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.240]   For them, all cops are corrupt, all of them.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.440]   And seeing it again from the outside,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.560]   I'm not there anymore.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   There's almost like a, "Why didn't you Ed?"
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.080]   That could have been easier maybe,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.320]   or you could have been dead long ago,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.120]   because people that are on the takedown there
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.040]   are usually owned by one side or the other.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.640]   And when that gets found out,
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.360]   if you have somebody that you're paying off
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.800]   that hints you off of drug operations in the area,
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.040]   your rivals are pretty keen on killing you.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   - Money aside, so like a Hummer aside,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.040]   how much of a motivator's fear?
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.760]   - It's a big one.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.400]   I'll say for me, I didn't think I was gonna lift the C30.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.560]   I was sure of it.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.200]   - Did that concept scare you,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.840]   or was that just a principle of life
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.440]   that you're operating under?
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.560]   - I lost my brother when I was 13 on a two.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.240]   He was 19.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.640]   He was like the VIP of the family.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.920]   - You miss him?
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.800]   - Oh, every day.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.760]   He was a skateboarded BMX, motorcycle hunter,
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.080]   one of the best marksmen that I've ever seen shoot.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.840]   - So better than you at everything.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.640]   - Yeah, he was the best of us is what we would say.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.400]   And when he died,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.000]   it was almost like a concert at his funeral.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.360]   I met three of his girlfriends
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.560]   that all introduced themselves like the one.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.960]   To this day, every now and then I get pulled aside down
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.280]   when I go back home,
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.840]   and they, "Hey, you're Eric's brother."
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.400]   Despite all the stuff that I've done,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.040]   I'm still, every now and then I get recognized.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.880]   That made my mom and my dad go into a horrible depression
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.000]   and basically left me to my devices when I was a kid
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.080]   from 13 onwards.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.280]   I had this self-destructive aspect to me after that,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.040]   I think, again, something that's come up in therapy
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.840]   after I've been gone through all that,
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.880]   and had this notion that if I can only die good
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.960]   in some way, shape, or form, or for something,
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.400]   that it would matter,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.720]   and they would look at me with the same reverence
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.600]   I did with my brother.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.080]   - So dying isn't the problem.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.360]   The goal of life is to die for something good.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.240]   - Yeah, at least that was my mindset
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.960]   going through that job.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.120]   I remember I was in medical school before that,
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.720]   second year of medical school.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.080]   I was doing pretty good, and then 9/11 happened,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.360]   and that wasn't an option anymore for me.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.480]   The economy was horrible.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.920]   Couldn't afford to stay there,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.640]   so I sat in the newspaper,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.560]   and my big brother, who's still alive and head,
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.360]   he's like, "No tenemos."
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.800]   You're not gonna do that shit.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.720]   We wouldn't dare.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.600]   And all of a sudden, I was in a field
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.280]   having my hair shaved off,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.400]   and a bunch of the gafes,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.920]   the guys that later turned into the Zeta Cartel military,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.840]   were in charge of our training,
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.040]   and I went through that process.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.640]   - In what field were you, and why is your head being shaved,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.960]   and what the hell was going through your mind?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.560]   What was the leap that you took?
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   - I was sold the idea of this being
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.360]   a new Americanized police force
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.480]   that they were constructing in Mexico.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.800]   - So elite, special force, kinda--
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.400]   - Prestigious, elite.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.560]   The people in charge of our training
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.960]   were a lot basically ex-Mexican gafe people.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.160]   Gafes are what the special forces kind of originated,
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.360]   and a lot of their members turned into the Zeta Cartel,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.080]   so they were brutal in their training.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.400]   We were sold this idea of it being scientific,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.560]   educated-based, and a career path.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.200]   And all of a sudden, we're in this refurbished prison
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.440]   that wasn't good enough to be a prison,
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.560]   and they turned it into a training ground.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.560]   And I quickly kinda realized
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.080]   that they were training us to be a paramilitary group,
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.240]   not a community policing organization,
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.040]   which in my mind, I thought,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.720]   that's what we were gonna be doing.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.080]   - What was the hardest process of that training for you?
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.880]   'Cause this is like a fragile, innocent boy
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.920]   becomes a man kinda process.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.240]   - They're turning us into something that they could use.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.600]   So it's a breaking down.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.920]   They break down the individual.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.800]   - Physically and mentally?
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   - Yeah, I think it's a half-done initiation process,
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.640]   I think, in a way, looking at it from now,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.800]   to the past, the shaving of the hair,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.120]   the stripping off your identity.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.480]   Everybody gets a number.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.720]   The uniforms, the running around
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   and being treated like human garbage.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.760]   The first thing they said to us
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.360]   when we were lined up in that field was,
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.280]   which means there's bread and dick to eat here.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.040]   And the bread ran out a week ago, right?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.400]   So it was, I mean,
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.040]   I can't equate it to anything in the military
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.960]   ever in the United States,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.080]   because people down there
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.360]   could actually get physical with us.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.960]   I mean, they could actually hit us
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.200]   and punch us and shit like that,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.920]   which is not allowed here anymore,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.800]   at least in most of the militaries
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.720]   and as horrible as down there.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.160]   AK-47s being shot around us to simulate reality,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.720]   basically causing hearing loss, that type of stuff.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.840]   - So chaos, abuse, really challenging you.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.800]   - Yeah. - Again, physically
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.640]   and mentally.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.400]   - And an open door there always.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.840]   So if you don't wanna be here, you can just walk out.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.760]   And the more you go into it,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.600]   time-wise, you're more invested you are.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.760]   So in a way, you're kind of building your own chains
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.240]   while you're going through that process.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.440]   - Were you tempted to walk out?
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.320]   - Yeah, several times, several times.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.200]   Specifically seeing some of the ways
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.240]   that people that I thought were better
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.960]   or stronger than me were walking out or quitting
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.400]   because of something that happened in there.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.880]   There was some sexual assault stuff
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.160]   happening in there as well.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.280]   - Were you afraid of that?
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.160]   - Always, you know, you're in a place like that
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.320]   and there's females in the environment
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.600]   and some of the instructors are doing what they do.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.160]   So that was like a cause for alarm.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.040]   I mean, these people are in charge of our safety
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.800]   and education and look at what's happening here.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.080]   So you could see some of the smarter ones leaving,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.920]   not looking at this as a viable choice for life.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   - How did that change you, those few months?
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.680]   - I had this motivation,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.280]   this idealistic motivation in my head,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   making a difference.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:55.400]   They drill a lot of nationalistic kind of,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.320]   the flag marching.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.680]   You being part of a group and the group being,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.320]   you know, behind you and all of this.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.400]   - What was the nationalistic pride?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.040]   It was in the nation of Mexico?
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.480]   - What's the vision of this great nation of Mexico
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.080]   that you were, did you believe,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.920]   did it get into your blood?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.640]   - It got into my, I mean, it's indoctrination, you know,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.880]   it's a paramilitary group.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.160]   So everything there is basically modeled
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.760]   after the military.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.880]   So that's what they were trying to kind of instill in us.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.320]   I was a team leader in there.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.680]   After three months, basically, I was,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.760]   we went through a bunch of trials, physical trials,
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.920]   mental trials and stuff like that.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.880]   And some of us were named team leaders.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.320]   And I, you know, bought into it.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.240]   You know, I'm the, I'm supposed to be here, look at me.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.680]   I'm making headways.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.160]   I'm sticking out a bit, you know.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.920]   And I was pretty proud of what I was going through there,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.760]   six months.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.640]   Then you get the reality check when you signed
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.480]   the dotted line and how that, none of it really meant
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.600]   anything as far as what we were about to go out and do.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.400]   You know, an example of this,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.920]   we were trained with a 92FS Beretta,
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   which is a nine millimeter pistol, Italian made.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.520]   We got to shoot 20 rounds out of that gun.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.440]   And then we, when we got out, we were handed a Glock 17,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.840]   which I've never seen one in my life.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.680]   I was trying to figure out where the safety was
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   and a few other people there were handling those guns
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.720]   in a horrible manner.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.800]   So we were very under-trained, under-equipped,
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.880]   and there was a lot of assumptions about what we knew.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.000]   And all of a sudden we're being cast into this,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.600]   the start of one of the bloodiest
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.280]   and longest lived modern conflicts in our history
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.560]   that doesn't get called that,
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.080]   but it's basically been an ongoing war in Mexico
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.080]   that is still to this day, amassing bodies.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.960]   - So the Mexican drug war.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.440]   - The Mexican drug war, which is,
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.680]   it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.400]   because when I was going through training,
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.640]   there was already stuff going on.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.040]   I went into training in 2004 and there were already
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.760]   major cartel related events all over Mexico by then,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.120]   but not at the size or scope as I was about to go into.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.080]   When President Felipe Calderon kind of took office down there
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.440]   and actually officially kind of kicked it off
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.600]   by putting the military in play
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.360]   as part of it basically militarized the drug war,
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.840]   including us.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.120]   - Who are the major players in this drug war?
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.960]   So the politicians, the military, the police force,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   the cartels, all Mexican, then the United States,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.680]   China, just to lay out all the pieces on the board.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.840]   - First off, there are giant local drug markets in Mexico
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.040]   that are fought over,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   just local drug markets that are huge in scope.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.840]   - So no exporting to other locations?
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.400]   - Just to start, yeah.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.080]   So a big problem in Mexico
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.560]   is basically those local drug markets.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.320]   And an example of that,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.720]   and one I have a lot of experience with
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.160]   is the one in Tijuana,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.800]   which not only feeds the local populace,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   but also feeds the populace from San Diego
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.560]   that crosses down into Tijuana and buys their product there.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.600]   And now, a phenomenon that's occurring now
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.840]   is marijuana trafficking is going from California
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.880]   down into Mexico because they produce better weed,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.000]   which is fascinating to see now.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.320]   - So there's already a channel,
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.280]   and you're kind of reusing that channel.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.320]   - Yeah, there's a lot of people and vehicles
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.840]   getting checked when they drive down.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.560]   And Tijuana is being called San Diego South now
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.240]   because all the economic migrants are living down there.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.000]   90% of all houses in Tijuana, new houses,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.480]   are being bought up by Americans.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.040]   So that'll tell you something about the impact and change
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.800]   that's going on down there.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.240]   So you have these local drug markets
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.000]   that are being fought over.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.400]   You also have these drug routes
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.760]   that go through Mexico, up into Mexico,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.200]   around Mexico, through the ocean, under the wall,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.080]   drug tunnels over the wall,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.400]   and on backpacks on migrants
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.100]   that go up into the United States.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.760]   Not only do the cartels make money off drug trafficking,
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.600]   but also extortion, money laundering,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.040]   paid protection schemes.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.920]   Any mining operation in Mexico will have to pay protection,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.000]   or else it'll get hit.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.120]   A lot of times, the largest money makers
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.640]   for some of these criminal groups are protecting
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.260]   and taxing anybody that goes across the border.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.740]   So that's also a big issue.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.920]   And it's not just, again,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.480]   some Americans think it's like the cartels.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.880]   They imagine this single or maybe two or three groups.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.640]   There's several out there.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.080]   I don't have a current estimate,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.240]   but last time I checked,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.760]   it was somewhere in the vicinity of 50,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.360]   the 70 different groups,
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.220]   some small that just dedicate themselves
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.300]   to a single little town somewhere.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.140]   There are armed groups
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.740]   that are basically in control of that area,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.720]   to some bigger federations, like the Sinaloa Cartel,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.240]   which is probably currently the largest
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.600]   and most powerful one in Mexico,
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.920]   and the New Generation Cartel,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.940]   which is growing exponentially right now.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.680]   So these criminal groups are players in that conflict.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.840]   Then another player that doesn't get talked about
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.440]   is politics, politicians.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.200]   There's an ongoing discussion that has been going on,
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   I think, since Trump was elected
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.840]   about cartels being terrorist organizations or not,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.220]   or if they fit that description.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:05.220]   Well, we are living through multiple assassinations
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.520]   on political candidates out in Mexico right now.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.280]   And most of those assassinations are motivated
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.080]   by one side sponsoring one candidate
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.720]   and the other side sponsoring the other.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.560]   What I mean by sides, I mean cartel groups.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.380]   So they have elected officials that are on the take.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.380]   And this is, we have many governors
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.080]   who are under investigation on the run
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.400]   or in prison right now, state governors.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.800]   So politics is involved in it.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.060]   That's a big player as well.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.040]   That doesn't, when you think about the cartel problems,
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.960]   you don't think, well, some, at least some,
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.320]   most people don't think about that aspect of it.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.080]   - So to have integrity as a politician in Mexico
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.280]   means you have no protection
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.400]   and under constant threat of assassination.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.600]   - We've just seen the arrest and prosecution
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.240]   of the head of all Conrad Cartel operations
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.360]   when I was active in the form of Garcia Luna,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.200]   who was, he was the guy, Felipe Calderon,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.400]   who kicked off the drug war.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.520]   That was his guy.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.280]   Turns out he was on the take at that level.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.680]   - Is there like a spectrum of how on the take you can be?
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.040]   Are there ethical lines that you can cross?
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.160]   Some of it is money.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.920]   And then is it possible to operate in a gray area
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:24.200]   that does not result in destructive ethical violations,
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.800]   deep ethical violations?
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.640]   - I have no idea.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.480]   I don't think there is realistically.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.040]   I mean, anything that kind of supports some of these groups,
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.240]   you know, you're supporting things of a horrible nature.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.040]   I just posted recently on my Instagram account
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.360]   of a lady that was in Guanajuato.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.000]   She's one of seven recently assassinated women
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.320]   that are looking for their kids, basically.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.440]   There's a bunch of groups and organizations out there
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.160]   in Mexico, some in Tijuana that I've actually walked with,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.880]   who are taking control of trying to find the bodies
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.520]   of their kids.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.680]   That's her up there.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.800]   - Maria Carmela Vasquez, a mother who searched
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.560]   for a missing son, was shot to death outside her home
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.960]   on Sunday.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.640]   Her son, Osmar Vasquez, disappeared on June 14th.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.160]   The 46-year-old woman is the fifth mother
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.280]   to be killed this year while searching
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.720]   for their missing loved ones.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.600]   She was a member of the Payamo Missing Person Collective.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.040]   - There's many groups out in Mexico
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.360]   who basically have given up on trusting the government
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.320]   to find their kids.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:42.080]   The number of missing in Mexico is a debated topic
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.400]   because, you know, the government itself
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   doesn't release those numbers,
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   or at least hasn't done a good job about keeping them
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.520]   and/or releasing them.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.120]   Mexico is a country that has industrialized body disposal.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.040]   You know, in Tijuana, we had the stew maker,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.240]   the legendary stew maker, which is a guy
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.080]   that basically used caustic acid
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:09.760]   to get rid of bodies at a massive level.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.120]   - So there's a separate operation
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.520]   for getting rid of bodies and murdering the people.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.840]   - At least in Tijuana, we saw that phenomenon,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   and it's obvious that it's going on all over Mexico.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.000]   - Who's having those discussions about mass murder
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.960]   and getting rid of people?
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.000]   I've been reading a lot about World War II recently,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.880]   and there's, was aggressive innovation on the Nazi side
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.120]   of how to get rid of a large number of people.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.040]   But for the longest time, both the Soviets,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.560]   and the Soviets were more brutal with this.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.360]   It's literally, it's a engineering problem
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   of how you kill a large number of people
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.760]   and get rid of their bodies.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   So the Soviets were more into just laying people,
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.320]   laying people down into the grave,
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.640]   face down, and then shooting them in the back of the head,
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.880]   and then doing that on mass scale.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.720]   So you just pile people on.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.880]   And then there was obviously innovation with the Holocaust
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.800]   in terms of gassing people and all that kind of stuff.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.360]   - I'm not sure exactly where these tradecraft skills
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.320]   are coming from specifically.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.920]   You hear discussions of Israelis training
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.440]   some of the cartel groups back in the late '90s,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.240]   specifically the Arionofis cartel.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.160]   There's a lot of stories about that.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.520]   A security specialist coming down and showing them things
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.300]   like how to make caustic soda,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.400]   how to put rocks inside of bodies,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.280]   and then chicken wire them around
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.640]   to throw them into the ocean or river
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.840]   so that their bodies don't float.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.680]   And when you kind of-
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.240]   - You put rocks inside a body
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.640]   to make sure the body doesn't float?
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.680]   - So you open up the intestinal tract, put rocks inside.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.180]   You cut where tattoos are, you take off hands and faces,
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.880]   and throw them somewhere else,
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.280]   and you wrap them in chicken wire.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.880]   - So make it not identifiable.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.640]   - Yeah, and throw them into a body of water.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.680]   And this is a horrible thing, but it's actually-
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.520]   - It's a craft.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.360]   - It's a trade craft.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.720]   - It's a trade craft, and there's a link to the US
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.040]   as far as that trade craft.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.600]   You have to remember that the United States
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.640]   had a thing called School of the Americas and the CIA,
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.160]   and they showed things, and a lot of that stuff
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.000]   is out there in the hands of people
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.480]   that are of that generation.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.280]   - So there's a manual-
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.640]   - There's a manual somewhere.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.240]   - Like with chapters, and it's like
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.520]   how to get rid of the body.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.480]   - There's manuals out there.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   - Under time constraints, or how identifiable
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.000]   can the body be afterwards,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.680]   what are geographical constraints, all that kind of stuff.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.440]   - I think that was common back in the early 2000s,
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.800]   and maybe the late '90s when some of these things
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.440]   were going on, but they've lost even that
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.000]   as far as respect for the government,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.560]   or bodies being found.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.920]   Right now, what you usually see is just bodies
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.520]   being burnt to a crisp and buried in a field somewhere.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.080]   That's usually what you'll see.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.080]   Some of the groups like this woman belong to
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.120]   basically taking it upon themselves to go out
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.800]   to find clandestine graves in the outskirts
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.640]   of the towns that they live in,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.480]   probing the ground with these metal probes,
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.640]   and seeing if whatever they encounter
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.960]   in the bottom of these clandestine graves
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.320]   stinks or not.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.920]   If they find IDs or clothing, they kind of gather that,
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.960]   and they basically present it to the investigative
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.520]   authorities in the towns or the states they live in,
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.360]   which basically are doing their jobs.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.080]   Over 90% of all murders in Mexico were never solved.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.040]   So they've even stopped trying to get rid of bodies
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.880]   in that way.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.680]   - How does a cartel take power?
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.040]   How does it gain control of this local area
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.760]   that you mentioned, and then grow,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.760]   take control of a region?
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.760]   And how does it do so in this dynamic relationship
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   between politicians and the military and the police force?
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.120]   - It's a thing that happens over time.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.640]   There has always been a big effort,
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.560]   even when I was in, to buy or own certain members
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.520]   of the police force.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.760]   Even when we're going through training,
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.560]   some people get pulled out during training
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.400]   because they were found out to have some sort of parent
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.800]   or sibling that was a cartel member,
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   or their FBI background check came back negative,
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.840]   you know, when they were already in the training program.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:34.720]   So I think part of it is, first off,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.920]   they take advantage of the fact that Mexico
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.800]   is a young country.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.360]   It's a country of young people.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:45.040]   We have a big group of young people that have
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.600]   little to no opportunities to come up.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.040]   When I was in, when I went to take that career path,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.440]   a lot of my friends took the other option.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.040]   They went to work for some of these criminal groups.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.440]   So they have this going for them.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.240]   They basically have a lot of bodies to hire cheaply.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.040]   - And leverage in terms of forcing those bodies
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.560]   to do whatever is needed,
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.120]   because the alternative for those people is nothing.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.280]   - There's no options.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.120]   So you have a kid somewhere who is working on a field,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.760]   or you have a kid like me that was out of the job,
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.840]   out of school, and the only options for me
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.760]   was this ad in the newspaper, which seemed like a long shot,
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.600]   or going with some of my friends that had cars now
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.200]   and were hanging out all night at these bars.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.640]   And some of them had, you know,
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.200]   Draco AK-47 pistols in their cars,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.240]   and it would look cool, you know?
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.640]   - So there is a trajectory.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.960]   There's many trajectories possibly in your life
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.080]   where you could have been still operating
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.520]   in a criminal organization in Mexico.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.760]   - Yeah, I mean, there's not a lot of options, you know?
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.720]   - Do you think you'd be good at it?
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.560]   - I don't know.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.960]   I mean, I'm pretty good at what I do now,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.480]   which is teaching people how to detect it
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.880]   and kind of fight against it, you know?
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.240]   So I think--
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.120]   - I have a sense that the skills transfer pretty well.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.960]   That's also the dark side of this whole thing.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.780]   - A lot of the people that I used to work with,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.120]   you know, I know things, and I have some training,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.640]   and I had some specialized training,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.400]   and I currently do, I've done, you know,
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.720]   presentations for the Secret Service and the FBI,
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.680]   and you name it, I've gone there and shown them what I do.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.960]   A lot of the people that I used to work with
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.440]   who are out of the job are in the wind, you know?
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.480]   And some of these people are way more trained than I am.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.080]   You know?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   It's interesting what the reason why I get looked for,
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.360]   and they ask me questions,
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.040]   is because I actually have the experience
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.800]   that my university was the most dangerous city
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.160]   on the planet.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.080]   And when people ask me about some of that stuff,
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.480]   I could speak from experience
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.120]   as far as encountering some of that directly.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.440]   Some of the people that I used to work with
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.720]   who were way better at it than I am are in the wind.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.640]   Yeah, interesting thing in Mexico.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.400]   If you are of a police organization
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.560]   and you get fired or you quit,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.640]   you are ineligible to join another police organization.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.400]   That discounts you.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.640]   So for somebody like me,
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.720]   who was a professional operations group member
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.760]   or a police officer in Mexico of that region,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.680]   there's no options for me outside of that.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.960]   So they themselves basically have created
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.120]   this inescapable box for some of these people
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.480]   that go into that line of work.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   And where do they go after?
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:33.080]   I've heard offers of $12,000 to join
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.240]   some of the organizations out there.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.040]   Plus, you know, they get benefits,
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.520]   not like the government, you know?
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.960]   I'm still waiting for my liquidation check.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.920]   This has been out of service for like six, seven years.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.480]   I'm still waiting for my check.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.640]   So some of these people,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.280]   it's obvious that the opportunities
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.120]   are presented to them out there are stronger, you know?
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.520]   And again, the youth is what gets eaten by this war.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.480]   And that's one of the main things that they start with,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.960]   just the youth.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.520]   We had a phenomenon in Tijuana,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.200]   late '90s, early 2000s called the Narco Juniors.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   Narco Juniors were basically middle class
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.160]   or upper class families,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.240]   had kids that were bored
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.040]   and they just joined some of these cartel groups.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.680]   These cartel groups saw in them
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.560]   opportunities to get into regular industry,
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.520]   to go through the family businesses,
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.160]   to kind of establish themselves,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.400]   use some of those businesses for storage,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.600]   or figure out how to use some of their
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.120]   transportation businesses for drug muleing.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.760]   So this is how they start
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.040]   in getting into different areas
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.160]   that they regularly couldn't.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.320]   And that's how it starts.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.000]   You owe somebody,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.880]   they get into paid protection type schemes,
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.120]   which are also common all over Mexico.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.240]   And sooner or later, they start owning businesses
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.360]   and they regulate some of their income.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.920]   So they become part of the local economy in a big way.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.960]   I had this experience in Sinaloa
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.640]   where we were driving down this shitty street
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.360]   and all of a sudden it became a cool, nice,
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.400]   curvy highway type thing.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.600]   And I looked around there, it's like,
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.280]   this is a nice road.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.400]   And the guy was with me, he said,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.880]   "Yeah, the cartels built it."
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.560]   You go to some of these towns
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.960]   and the cartels are the government there.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   They build the hospitals, they build the churches,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   they build the schools.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.160]   COVID happens, they're enforcing the mask mandates.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.880]   They're out enforcing the mask mandates.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.000]   The stay at home policies.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.280]   They're the ones delivering supplies
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.560]   to the townspeople in bags,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.400]   courtesy of so-and-so cartel.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.960]   So they become the Robin Hood characters
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.800]   of their environments.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   If they're smart,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   these groups basically turn into that,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.680]   Robin Hood, stealing from the rich
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.640]   and giving to the poor,
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.080]   or at least that's the projection that they give.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:05.560]   - What's the role of violence in this operation?
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.360]   - I'm extreme.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.200]   It used to be that there were rules,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.280]   as you say, like, don't go after kids,
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.800]   don't go after women,
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.760]   but all those things are gone now.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.720]   They had been gone for decades, I think.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.360]   The escalation of violence.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.600]   You kill one of mine, I'll kill four of yours.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.680]   You kill four of mine, I'll go after your family
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.040]   because you were in hiding.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.520]   There's stories of high-level cartel people
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.600]   getting their sons and daughters murdered,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.920]   mutilated in revenge killings.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.720]   So I think it's at a point where it spiraled out
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.920]   of semblance of a rule set
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.960]   as far as who can get exposed to some of this violence.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   Those highly-produced ISIS videos
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.200]   where they show torture and executions,
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.640]   according to some of the sources that I've talked to
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   here in the United States
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.240]   that were looking at that phenomenon,
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.280]   they said that it seems to be that that was influenced
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.640]   by some of the narco blog videos
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.920]   that were coming out of Mexico in the early 2000s.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.840]   Basically, that some of these groups were the first ones
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   that got wind of the fact that you can export terror
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.920]   or the horror that an execution has through social media.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.240]   Way back when Facebook was a bit more
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.000]   of a wildland area,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.360]   you could see these in newsfeeds,
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.440]   videos of executions, tortures,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.920]   and stuff like that coming out of Mexico.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.000]   - On Facebook?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.840]   - Way back when.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.680]   - Wow.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.000]   - This was a different time.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.600]   - People who criticize social media in the moderation
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.320]   is a tough job,
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.920]   because the brutal world out there.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.440]   - I mean, I remember seeing some of these ISIS videos
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.480]   on Facebook way back when,
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.880]   and they cracked down on all that.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.560]   But one that's kind of clear,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.880]   and I'm not gonna say where to find it,
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.720]   but people out there might've seen it
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.280]   because some of these videos get shared
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.040]   through WhatsApp groups and chat groups out there.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.320]   One of the ones that caught my attention way back when
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.840]   was two guys getting executed by a chainsaw.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:19.600]   And people can kind of imagine what that would be like.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.040]   - This is produced on purpose?
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.880]   - Yes.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.720]   - Like it's videotaped on purpose?
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.080]   - Yeah, it's a cartel group, rival cartel members,
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.920]   and a way to send a message to those other rival cartel
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   is to basically execute these people in front of a camera.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.640]   I mean, you can't get to your rivals,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.160]   but you can make them see what they're doing,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.600]   or at least make their people look at what happens
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.320]   if you invade their territory.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   - Just an escalation of brutality and the violence as well.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.160]   - I mean-
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.200]   - And that leads to terror,
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.680]   and then some mass communication of terror.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.440]   - Yeah, I mean, you have videos of some of these people
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.040]   engaging in cannibalism in front of a video
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.440]   to see how brutal they are,
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.440]   or people taking out somebody's heart while they're alive
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.480]   and filming it.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.880]   And it used to be social media as a whole,
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.000]   you would see some of these videos,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.520]   they would get put down in a few days.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.600]   But now there's a telegram groups,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.200]   there's live leaks,
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.160]   there's a bunch of other sites out there
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.480]   that kind of disperse some of these videos.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.040]   And it's basically a bulletin board for them
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.320]   as far as, "Hey, you got into my territory,
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.320]   well, this is what's gonna happen to you."
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:39.560]   - Is there a game theoretic way to remove
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.800]   this kind of brutality, to deescalate the brutality?
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.000]   'Cause it seems like if a cartel takes power
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.640]   that exceeds the power of politicians in a locality,
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.760]   there's a strong incentive to reduce the brutality,
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.000]   to crack down on this kind of chainsaw executions.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   - You know, there was a recent leak of government files,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.160]   called the Guacamaya leaks.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.200]   It's our version of WikiLeaks, I guess.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.240]   And it was mostly documents
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.520]   coming out of the Mexican military.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.360]   I haven't seen it talked about a lot here in stateside,
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.680]   but it's a pretty big thing down in Mexico.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.760]   And in some of those documents,
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.240]   it reveals how powerless the government is,
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.080]   I mean, as far as the military goes.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.020]   So that's another player in Mexico, the military.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.960]   The military has been out in force in the streets,
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.640]   basically doing a policing role
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.520]   since Felipe Calderon was the administration.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.840]   He basically militarized the drug war.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:45.600]   Felipe Calderon was to the right of the political spectrum.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.560]   And his main rival, who was way to the left,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.720]   is now in power.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.400]   And one of the campaign promises he had
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.160]   was to demilitarize the drug war,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.440]   to send the military back to its barracks and all that.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.880]   And he's basically continuing on.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.920]   They just passed some legislation
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.440]   that basically keeps the military on the streets
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.740]   for a few more years, you know?
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:13.840]   And I think some of these documents that were leaked
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.520]   are very telling as far as why that is.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.480]   They have, the military now has a vast amount of power
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.160]   when it comes to security industry.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.960]   I mean, they're in charge of building airports
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.520]   and train lines in Mexico now.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.560]   Their documents themselves show how certain regions
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.640]   in Mexico who have a specific military presence
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.440]   work for one side or favor one side of the cartel.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.240]   - They're corrupted too.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.080]   So there's these military forces that are in part corrupted.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.120]   - Yes.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.200]   - And the cartel, who operates with violence,
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.440]   somehow finding a balance between each other.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.260]   It just feels like throughout human history,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.260]   there's dictators or leaders that come
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.220]   into situations like this
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.080]   and really crack down on the violence.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   - Yeah.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.040]   - So it seems like that's not happening.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.560]   It seems like there's a kind of market
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.040]   of violence happening here.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.120]   - There's a systemic amnesia that happens
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.160]   every presidency in Mexico.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.540]   So president comes in, he has five to six years
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.280]   to do whatever he needs to do, and he does everything.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.080]   And as soon as he's gone, everything he did,
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:30.080]   even what was working, gets chopped off.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.040]   Police organizations get defunct
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.900]   or the names get changed, uniforms change.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.760]   - So there's a lot of turnover everywhere?
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.960]   - Every five years federally, there's a turnover
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.500]   and things change.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.560]   - What about the cartels, do they persist?
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.400]   - Yeah.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.280]   - Do the leadership persist?
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.160]   - I mean, the Sinaloa cartel has had a figurehead
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.800]   behind it since the '80s, the same one.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.720]   I mean, it's a federation of smaller cartels
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.800]   that are all kind of linked up,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.440]   but pretty much historically,
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.240]   he was considered the head of the Sinaloa cartel.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.280]   Elmira Zambada has been there since the '80s.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.400]   So in a way, yeah, he's persisting.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.580]   He's surviving all of these presidencies.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.500]   Again, these documents that were leaked
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.820]   are a clear sign of what strengths and weaknesses
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.860]   there are as far as the government's main weapon
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.100]   against some of these criminal groups,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.980]   which is the military.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.860]   And if people doubt this, they can look it up now online
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.940]   because all these documents are out there.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   But just a clear thing, the Mexican Navy or the Marina
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.540]   doesn't work with the Mexican army.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.880]   They don't speak to each other.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.200]   So that should tell you everything you need to know
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.080]   as far as trust.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.100]   - That could be just bureaucratic dysfunction.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.640]   - They don't trust each other.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.040]   - Are they both struggling with the problem of corruption?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.320]   - Some of these documents that are already out there
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.040]   talk about the ports in Mexico,
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.960]   which are probably the main conduit
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.120]   of precursors of methamphetamines
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.540]   and precursors of things like fentanyl into the country.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:10.000]   They're operated and guarded by the Marina, right?
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.520]   So these things are happening under their watch.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   And then you get talk about the army in certain places,
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:21.800]   basically working counter cartel operations
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.040]   to specifically one side, not another,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.520]   as far as the rival groups out there.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.120]   And we have a long history of some of these groups going,
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.440]   military groups going rogue.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.400]   Losetas are a prime example of this.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.760]   These special forces units that basically turned around
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.200]   and went to work as bodyguards for the Gulf cartel
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.040]   and then decided to,
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.880]   but what they basically did
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.440]   was an internship with a cartel.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.520]   They went out there, did bodyguarding for the Gulf cartel,
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.760]   and then realized they can do a better job
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.240]   than they were doing, so they started their own,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.720]   sparking off one of the, again, one of the bloodiest
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.800]   internal cartel wars in Mexico's history.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.920]   - Who was El Chapo?
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.600]   - El Chapo was a part of the leadership,
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.000]   or at least a faction of the leadership in the cartel.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.080]   It's a federation of different, of small organizations,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.080]   well, I say small organizations,
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.680]   basically families or organizations
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.240]   that conform this larger group,
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   which is the Sinaloa cartel that is based out of Sinaloa.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:26.240]   Basically, they are people that have family
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.200]   and power nucleuses there in Sinaloa.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.960]   I mean, who was he?
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.440]   I think he was a high-level operator
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.560]   for the Sinaloa cartel.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.480]   He had his own drug routes, his own networks,
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.640]   his family nucleus down there,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.040]   still in control of some of those operations,
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.800]   so his arrest really didn't change anything.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.920]   But he wasn't the mastermind, number one leader
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   that I think the media and the government
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.560]   kind of portrayed him as.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.600]   - Who was the mastermind?
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.640]   - If you go down there and you read
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   what most of the brave journalists in Mexico that we have,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.720]   say another aspect of this war
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.200]   is that a lot of journalists get killed.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.800]   I think Mexico has some of the top numbers in the world.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.160]   This is no secret to anybody.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.720]   El Mayo Zambada is the name of the historical figurehead
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.120]   of this cartel, or at least somebody who people theorize
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.920]   or suspect to be the main guy or the main person
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.240]   that is in charge of some of this criminal group.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.920]   - Is he still alive?
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.560]   - That's the going rumor that he's still very much alive.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.640]   The interesting thing about him
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.040]   is that he learned his craft in Los Angeles.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.440]   So people thinking that Sinaloa cartel
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.280]   isn't a Mexican thing, it's actually,
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.240]   he apparently learned a lot of his craft
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.000]   from people in the United States.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.720]   - And that's the craft of leadership,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.680]   the craft of business, the craft of which aspect of the craft?
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.280]   - The craft of getting a product from Colombia,
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.400]   putting it through Mexico.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.360]   - And the logistics.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.760]   - The logistics part of it.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:11.240]   - And he somehow is operating in the shadows,
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.320]   so he's not a known entity.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.860]   - I don't have a clear number of this,
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.640]   but he was interviewed by a magazine
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.680]   called Proceso in Mexico,
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.840]   and some pictures were taken of him.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.560]   This was over 10 years ago, probably,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.240]   and that's the last time anybody's
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.640]   ever seen a picture of him.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.320]   - What's it like to be a journalist?
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.560]   So can a journalist have a conversation with him and live?
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.240]   - Not unless he asks to have that conversation.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.380]   I think he reached out to this journalist to talk about it.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:43.280]   There's a media wing to the work that we do,
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.120]   a sister page called Demoler,
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.400]   and it's run by some pretty good people.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.680]   And the way we met is that I was basically training them
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.240]   how to work in hostile environments,
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.880]   and they were like, "Oh, we're gonna go report
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.480]   "on cartel activity in Mexico."
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   And I was like, "(sighs)
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.860]   "That is a year and a half ago,
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.480]   "a reporter went to the president's daily briefing,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.720]   "press conference that he has."
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.680]   They called them La Mañaneras,
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.960]   President Manuel Lopez Obrador,
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.160]   and told him to his face,
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.920]   "I have threats on my life, they're trying to kill me."
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.120]   And it happened.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.480]   There's been a slew of assassinations and murders
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.240]   of members of the press all over Mexico.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.840]   It's not an easy job.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.080]   Either they say too much,
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.000]   or they say things that favor one side or the other,
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.400]   which is another aspect of it that is interesting.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.720]   I don't consider myself a reporter.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.520]   I don't report on the news in Mexico.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.080]   I have friends that do that very well.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.760]   I commentate on some of it only.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.160]   But you see a lot of these cartel reporters go down there,
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.400]   talk to a specific side,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.440]   and basically speak one side of the story,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.800]   and that is not something that the other side wants.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   If you go down there and speak to one side,
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.320]   you're saying what they want people to know or hear.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.640]   So in a way, you're kind of spreading
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.240]   some of their cartel propaganda in a way.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.120]   And that's how some people get shot.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:16.120]   - Do you think it's possible to go in there
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.200]   and have a conversation with a cartel leader?
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.320]   - Well, Sean Penn- - Or somebody like me,
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.800]   for somebody like Sean Penn?
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.160]   - This is what I will say.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.880]   After that whole Sean Penn thing,
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.160]   I think a lot of people would reconsider
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.080]   a meeting with anybody of any level
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.240]   that has any variety here in the United States.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.560]   They wouldn't trust anybody to get that close.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.000]   There are people out there that will talk to reporters,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.840]   people that are working on a lab or laboratory
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.400]   somewhere in a hillside, somewhere down south,
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.600]   in the Sierra, low-level people that get authorization
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.280]   to speak to reporters and stuff like that,
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.120]   but they don't say anything that isn't being taught
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.160]   or shown in various different ways
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.920]   or outlets out there for them.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.040]   I mean, some of these guys have Instagram accounts.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.960]   Some of these guys blog about it.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.800]   - But not the leaders.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.720]   - TikTok, no, not the leaders.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.000]   I think after what happened to El Chapo Guzman,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.040]   I think that opportunity, that window was closed
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   for some of the leadership down there.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.120]   - I think, I disagree.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.320]   I think they're just more sensitive,
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:21.720]   realizing that there has to be a deep trust.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.720]   It's not just anybody and not any high-profile.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.400]   I've gotten a chance to speak
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.120]   to some very high-profile leaders
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.080]   that don't speak to journalists,
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.720]   and they understand the value of trust.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.440]   - If they have something to say,
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.600]   which I don't think they do, you know,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.640]   I don't think they, unless at some point in the future,
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.880]   which is something I suspect might be coming,
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.560]   that there is some sort of armed intervention
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.080]   or external attack on some of these criminal groups
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.760]   that really puts the pressure on them.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.320]   - You don't think there's a human aspect to this,
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.080]   of a human being wanting their story to be known?
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.520]   Versus, is this different than the propaganda machine
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.160]   of I have something to say,
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.720]   I have some message to put out there
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.040]   to play the game of politics and power and money
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:15.920]   and all that kind of stuff?
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.480]   Isn't there also a human being
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.600]   underneath all that armor that,
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:24.080]   for the sake of perhaps ego, legacy,
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.880]   wants to be understood?
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.400]   - I think in a way, they already do that.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   There's corridos, which are basically Mexican folk songs
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.040]   that get sung about some of them.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.320]   So in a way, some of these singers
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.560]   are reporting on some of their lives,
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.280]   and it's a great honor to have a corrido made about you.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   Somebody made a corrido about me
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.840]   based on my interviews, right?
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.240]   I didn't pay for it, so it's a real one.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.080]   It feels cool.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.400]   - So creating a myth, the legend of the man.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.600]   - I think it's about,
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.480]   I think a way you can find somebody like that
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.560]   is somebody that wants to get their story,
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.520]   specifically clear and straight,
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.680]   coming from that culture
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.680]   and getting to work for the government down there
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.560]   and then not working for the government down there
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.360]   and being on the outside, being critical
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.280]   of not only the government that is in place now,
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.640]   but also the government that I actually work with.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.560]   I can tell you that there's villains
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.720]   all over the place down there.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.320]   Everybody's a villain, you know,
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.600]   at all levels in some way, shape, or form.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.840]   And some of these people,
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.680]   I think in a way, including El Chapo,
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.120]   I think that some of that meeting was about film rights
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.000]   and stories and being able to get his story out there.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.880]   I think, I'm not too sure, because I wasn't there,
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.320]   but I suspect that some of that was going on.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.200]   If you can bring an honest voice down there,
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.240]   they can trust to put that out there.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.840]   Yeah, I mean, I think you could try.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.520]   - I'm interested in that kind of thing,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.440]   because ultimately in some of those places,
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.480]   like inside a cartel at the very top
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:07.520]   is when you can really look at the raw aspects
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:11.120]   of human nature in a way you can't necessarily elsewhere.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.880]   - There's a youth coming into power down there.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.320]   And when I say youth, I mean,
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.920]   some of the old guard is going out
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.760]   and some of the new guard is coming in.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.480]   An example of this is El Chapo Guzman's sons,
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.920]   who are now in their own right,
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.040]   kind of gaining legendary status.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.200]   There was an attempted arrest on his son
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.800]   that led to the famous Culiacanazo incident,
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.480]   which we are now learning more about
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.360]   because some of the Guacamaya leaks
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.720]   are kind of speaking more about what happened that day.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.040]   Basically a federal operation,
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   they say to arrest El Chapo Guzman's son,
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:55.720]   turned into a siege to try and get him free.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.440]   They called in the Calvary,
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.160]   basically the whole of the Sinaloa cartel
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.360]   showed up to try and rescue him.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.120]   Interesting thing about that is,
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   in reading some of the documents
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.480]   and also just seeing some of the videos
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.820]   and stuff like that came out of that incident,
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.440]   the cartels were the ones evacuating
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.080]   the citizenship from the area.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.880]   They were the ones going restaurant to restaurant
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.480]   saying, "Hey, if you wanna exit the city,
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.880]   "go through here, take your families, get down,
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.660]   "but you have to leave because the army's coming here,
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.920]   "they're gonna fight us."
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.840]   - So there's like a deep morality to all of that.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.880]   Underneath the violence, there's a humanity.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.240]   - I mean, it's their home.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.320]   It is their home, and they were fighting for their home
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.020]   and they were fighting for leadership from their home.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.920]   There is a morality, there is a humanity there.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.220]   And again, if people wanna paint them all
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.640]   with the villainy aspects,
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   everybody's a villain in somebody else's story,
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.040]   if you kinda look at it that way.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.880]   - People should check out your Patreon,
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.480]   should check out your field notes.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.760]   You're a really good writer, your Instagram too.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.000]   You write about, you have a quote
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.760]   in your field notes about villains.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.200]   Quote, "I once worked for a villain,
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.060]   "a savior to some and a biblical demon of old to others,
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.020]   "a true product of his environment.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.400]   "He was the best and the worst of us.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.080]   "We're all potential villains in someone else's story,
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.980]   "he would say to us as we would head out into the unknowns
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.100]   "that the night had waiting for us.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.620]   "It was during one of these nights that I looked around me
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.560]   "and saw horns and pitchforks among my people
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.040]   "and realized what he meant.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.400]   "We were no knights of the round table.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.600]   "Whatever we were, we were needed.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.560]   "In the end, I guess that justified
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.240]   "most of what was about to happen."
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.240]   Do you think El Chapo, do you think people like him
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.720]   are good or evil?
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.800]   - I think there's no one without the other.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   I think there's a cost to their goodness that they do.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.480]   The roads they build, the hospitals,
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.640]   the career paths that they pay for.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.640]   There are doctors in Mexico that their careers
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.560]   were paid for by some of these groups.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.640]   And they do a lot of amazing good for the community.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.160]   I remember there was a surgeon
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.300]   reconstructing cleft palates.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.240]   In one of my travels that I did out there,
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.200]   I spent some time actually going out there
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.080]   after I got out of the job to train people
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.760]   and this type of stuff that I show people.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.040]   And they told me, I told them,
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.520]   "You're doing God's work.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.260]   "This stuff is like legit.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.080]   "This is God's work."
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.920]   Building smiles for people.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.000]   And I said, "Yeah."
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.840]   And then, "Can I talk to you?"
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.960]   "Yeah."
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   He said, "My career path was paid for by cartel,
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.540]   "a group of cartel members.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.800]   "They paid for my career path
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.540]   "because they wanted somebody on hand
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.000]   "that could fix their teeth."
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.480]   - Do you think some aspect of that
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.520]   is just sort of manipulative control
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.320]   or is some of it also just, again,
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.280]   a care for the population, for fellow human beings
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.260]   that are one of your own?
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.640]   - I think both.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.920]   I think there's, again,
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.040]   it's hard to just make them saints or devils.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.180]   Some of the good they do in some of their communities
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.340]   and don't ask anything for in return.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:21.060]   And even if they don't ask it for anything in return
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.340]   where the military shows up,
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.020]   they are immediately met with rocks and roadblocks
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:29.740]   and everybody's main weapon down there,
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:34.020]   since most Mexicans can't buy or own firearms,
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.780]   their main weapon down there is silence
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.180]   and their eyes to report to the people
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.460]   that they consider the good guys in their environment.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:47.260]   So, that's a hard question.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.300]   I think there's a bit of both
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.440]   and both the government and the criminal groups
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.020]   that are operating down there.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.880]   - Silence is their main weapon.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.420]   So, El Chapo is currently in prison.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.220]   Is he worth talking to?
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.100]   - I'd say yes.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.540]   - Is there things that to you are interesting about him
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.580]   that are still not understood?
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.180]   Is he a window into something
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.260]   that you don't understand about that world still?
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.900]   Or are curious about in that world?
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.660]   - I think he's a window into the family dynamics
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.480]   of that world.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.700]   When I say family dynamics,
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:23.900]   Mexico has a big thing about compadres and hermanos.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.780]   We have people that we call family
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.620]   that we're not necessarily a family.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:34.140]   He is somebody that witnessed the construction
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.660]   of what is now the Sinaloa cartel.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.260]   Like he was in it way back when he started off as a farmer
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.820]   and then went into trafficking.
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.580]   He's from a town called Bandera Huata,
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.080]   which is basically, that's the Wakanda of cartels.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.480]   Basically, that's where a lot of that originates.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.620]   The things that he saw as far as
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.820]   how some of these things got built,
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.780]   I think would be an interesting topic of conversation
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.980]   with somebody like him.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.500]   - So that story is a story of evolving family dynamics.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.340]   So part of the story of the cartel is individual humans.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:13.500]   - Marrying other families, getting named padrino,
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.880]   basically godfathers to other people's kids.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.360]   Forming family and blood ties and influence ties
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.540]   to people not only in Mexico, but in the United States.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.580]   And seeing how that dynamic and family dynamic
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.520]   is still there.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.620]   So he's gone, he's in prison,
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.500]   but he's probably on his way
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.860]   to be our next clandestine saint.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.620]   You go to the chapel of Malverde.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:44.260]   Malverde is basically a Mexican Robin Hood's folk saint
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.360]   down there who is a saint of traffickers.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.360]   And at his shrine, you have a small little chapel shrine
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.860]   right next to it.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.100]   So he's on his way to sainthood in Mexico,
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.700]   not recognized by the Catholic church,
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.920]   but that doesn't matter in Mexico anymore.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.940]   Speaking to somebody like him,
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:07.860]   you can consider him somebody that lost,
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.880]   he's arrested, but his family's okay.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.380]   His legacy is out there.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.020]   He's probably gonna be the next folk saint
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.300]   when he passes away.
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.660]   - Do you think he feels like the new wave
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.660]   of what the cartel has become has betrayed him,
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.820]   has left him behind?
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:28.840]   Because it seems like the way the cartel operated
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.420]   has changed over the decades.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.900]   - Yeah.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.300]   Well, number one, their power and influence is bigger.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:39.780]   You know, there are Sinaloa cartel operations in Colombia,
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.020]   straight to the, like in the source of it.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:47.460]   And then they have a clear presence
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.020]   in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:50.980]   They're in the United States.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.860]   The whole thought process that a lot of Americans have,
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.500]   like, "Oh, we don't want that trouble over here.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.900]   "We don't want them to get here,
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.980]   "or like build the wall and all this."
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.700]   - So they're deeply integrated into legitimate businesses.
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.060]   - I mean, they've been having kids and families up here
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.460]   since for a long time.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.900]   Some of these people have American passports
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.940]   that work not only directly for them,
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.260]   but have blood ties down there.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.020]   You know, there's been dragnets and arrests
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.220]   of some of these criminal organizations, states.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.980]   New Generation Cartel had one two, three years ago,
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.180]   where I think it was Operation Anaconda,
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.460]   I think it was called.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.020]   They arrested over 80 of their operatives.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.460]   And this is a new cartel that is very militaristic
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.660]   and growing in Mexico.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.340]   And they had over 80 arrests in the United States,
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.020]   you know, of members of them operating here.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.740]   - And so you could be a legitimate operator
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.940]   inside the United States.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.700]   That's hard to detect.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.100]   Makes you wonder how many in the US government,
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.060]   the politicians here.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.460]   The role of the United States in the drug war,
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:58.180]   financially in terms of power, is very big.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.020]   - Yeah.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.780]   - Surely there's politicians that have a finger into this.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.780]   - Immigration is part of it.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.780]   Illegal immigration is part of it.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.620]   And the influence that that has as a bargaining chip
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.460]   and a political chip.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.620]   We saw this with the first caravan kind of coming up
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.060]   and how it was politicized.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.780]   The money, Fast and Furious,
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:20.700]   and guns being basically let walk down into Mexico.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.220]   People that don't know, basically,
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.820]   the ATF had this operation where they were looking
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.100]   at straw purchasers of firearms.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.300]   Basically people buying up a specific type of firearms
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   that were on a shopping list that the cartels wanted to buy.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.500]   Including, you know, 50 cals, FN-57 pistols,
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.860]   which are small pistols with a high velocity round
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.820]   that'll go through a bulletproof vest.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:47.500]   AR-15s of all kinds that could quickly be modified
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.540]   into full auto down in Mexico.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.540]   With a, with a, drilling a few holes
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.220]   and making a few things to them.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.980]   So these people were buying all these,
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:58.340]   the ATF was watching them and allowing them
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.180]   to walk those firearms into Mexico
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.180]   under the guise of trying to track them somehow.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.540]   Which doesn't make a lot of sense for most people
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.780]   that kind of look at that operation.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.260]   The only people found, the only reason people found out
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.540]   about it was because of the murder of a few federal agents,
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.620]   of the US federal agents that were killed with those guns.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.380]   One of my friends was shot with one of those pistols
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.660]   outside of his house.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.340]   And they shot him and they shot her, his wife.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.100]   Both of them were killed.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.580]   Daughter was in the backseat, lost part of her arm.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.380]   When that happened, the guns were unique.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.780]   They were like, oh, we didn't never,
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.060]   like the mata policias is what they call them down there,
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.060]   the cop killers.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.740]   I hadn't seen those before.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.380]   So they were unique and interesting.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.540]   And later on in life, I was watching CNN
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.020]   and seeing the hearings going on.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.220]   I was like, oh, that's where they came from.
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:53.900]   Two federal agents changed a lot.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.260]   It was politicized, there was a whole scandal up here.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.660]   But in Mexico, how many people died with those firearms?
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.540]   You know, being let down, being let go down there.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.100]   And also what type of sentiment you think
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.900]   the local populace has of the United States,
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.460]   after all those guns were basically handed over
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.380]   to some of these groups.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.300]   You know, gun trafficking is another giant part
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.420]   of the equation and part of the problem down there,
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.780]   as far as the amount of munitions, weapons.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:25.540]   And now we were also getting tradecraft material
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.020]   from conflict zones outside of Mexico.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.620]   So weaponized drones.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:34.220]   The first time we saw some of those weaponized drones
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.340]   was in Syria.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.420]   And like a few weeks later, you know,
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.700]   grenades were being dropped on the roofs
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.300]   of some public officials' building.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.020]   - The cartels are using drones?
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.900]   - Yeah, that's been going on for a while.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.100]   There's a place in Michoacan
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.980]   that has some pretty interesting videos.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.380]   And the interesting part of it is because
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.420]   the federal police down there are actually working
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:00.340]   hand in hand with a United Carteles Unidos group,
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.860]   which is basically the local cartels,
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.740]   to try and fight off the New Generation Cartel
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.700]   moving into Michoacan.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.700]   So even the federal forces are fighting with the cartels
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.780]   to try and keep this larger cartel out.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.260]   And there's videos of these civilian drones
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.740]   basically dropping explosives.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.660]   They found some explosive testing ranges out there
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.700]   that are basically replicating stuff
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.580]   that you would see the IRA use during the troubles out there
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.900]   from homemade mortars.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.380]   You know, IEDs have been used in Mexico
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.780]   that not that much,
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:35.260]   but they're making like a presence again.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:37.860]   You know, we don't have a lot of ordinance around like Iraq,
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.940]   but we do have a big mining industry down there.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.020]   So mining explosives of all kinds are pretty easy to get.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.260]   So you start seeing that.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.780]   And also, I mean, there's some exotic weaponry
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:52.500]   coming in from the South now and from the ocean.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.420]   Some of it is probably US military equipment
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.820]   sold to various South American governments
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.060]   that are now not as stable as they were,
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.100]   and they're kind of making their way into black markets.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.300]   So a lot of those 50 cal
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.900]   and vehicle mounted technical type machine guns
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   and some of the RPGs and man pads
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.540]   or remote control guided missiles
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.660]   that have been found in cartel hands
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.100]   are probably making their way up from down South.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.700]   - Do you get these like multimillion dollar systems
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.420]   like the HIMAR system in the Ukraine?
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.700]   You get like super sophisticated advanced technology
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:29.700]   or we're not?
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.860]   So like, this is like military grade.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.900]   I'm not sure what the application would be exactly
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.260]   in Mexico.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.780]   - Some of the sophisticated stuff I see in our man pads,
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.100]   which is basically remote guided missiles.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:41.940]   I've seen some of those found down there.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.920]   - What is the application exactly?
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.740]   A display of power?
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.100]   - There are no fly zones over parts of Mexico.
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.340]   - For this reason?
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.580]   - The New Generation Cartel took down a helicopter.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.460]   There's been incidents of military helicopters
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.500]   falling from the sky and they said
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.900]   that it was mechanical issues.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.340]   But again, I'm not gonna do conspiracy theories out there,
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.300]   but there's a lot of videos on TikTok
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:15.220]   of Sinaloa cartel forces at parties
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.180]   carrying around rocket launchers on their backs.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.740]   - So there's an increased probability
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.500]   of mechanical failures over those areas
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.500]   when you're flying a helicopter.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.700]   - Yeah, there's no fly zones
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.460]   over some parts of Mexico.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.540]   And another thing you're seeing now is night vision,
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.100]   night vision equipment that is clearly military grade
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.620]   from the US that was probably abandoned
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.380]   in some war field out there,
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:44.060]   maybe Afghanistan or somewhere like that.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.780]   And it's being found in safe houses
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.660]   and in the hands of cartel forces.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.700]   You wanna talk about a scary opponent,
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.980]   somebody wearing night vision with a suppressed firearm.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:59.500]   Those types of capabilities are now out there.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.780]   Also, there's this tendency to think in every now
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.100]   and then you'll see these cartel videos
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.860]   with these guys carrying around these 50 cals
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.900]   and they show up, they stand there like,
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.900]   you know, boasting about their rifles
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.940]   and everybody laughed at them
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.460]   because the 50 cal or anything like that
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.540]   without a optic on it, you know,
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.980]   it's like you're gonna shoot,
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.420]   you're praying, shoot basically,
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.700]   see if you can hit anything with it.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:24.380]   But now there's a few of my sources
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.780]   of obscene, you know, sophisticated,
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:30.700]   laser guided range finders and sighting systems
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.020]   on some of these that are being found out there.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.940]   - How much damage can 50 cal, what's the application?
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.860]   - They started getting them specifically
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:40.580]   with the proliferation of armored vehicles in Mexico.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.580]   Mexico has a giant industry in armored vehicles as far as.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.340]   - So there's a race in terms of armoring,
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.700]   like protecting especially high value targets
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.780]   and then weapons that can deal with those armored,
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.780]   the protected high value targets.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.900]   - There was an attempted assassination
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.860]   of a state prosecutor somewhere in,
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.900]   I think Central Mexico, I forget exactly where,
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.460]   but she was riding around a up armored Jeep,
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.100]   Cherokee I think it was,
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:14.900]   and their main means of firepower was 50 cals
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.140]   and that car was left in pieces.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.100]   He survived in it,
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.060]   so I think the armored vehicle company that sold her
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.060]   that vehicle has it in the display room.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.860]   Then before my time, probably two, three years
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.780]   before I was actually active,
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.100]   they tried to kill the head of public security
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.820]   in the state of Baja,
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.860]   and with him it was a grenade launcher,
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.940]   40 millimeter grenade launcher.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.980]   It skipped off the armored vehicle
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.020]   and landed in the car behind it, made the back explode.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.660]   One of the guys that I used to work with
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.700]   was actually in that car, he survived it.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.900]   But you started to see,
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.100]   oh, they're using our vehicles now,
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.140]   let's get 50 caliber now to try and defeat that armor.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:03.300]   So that, yeah, there's always this race of technology
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.940]   basically down there, armored vehicles,
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.500]   how do you take on an armored vehicle?
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.900]   Well, there's a few ways, 50 cals,
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.820]   if you can mount them in the right way
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.900]   and shoot at a car like that,
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.020]   or a bunch of kids with balloons and acrylic paint
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:18.820]   on the front windshield and blind the vehicle
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.820]   so they can't drive it anymore is another way.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:26.980]   A tow line across a road painted black
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.660]   so you can't see it, and cut the thing in half.
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.220]   Again, I'm not saying any secrets,
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.660]   these are things that people have seen out there.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:38.220]   Shoot at the radiator, you know?
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.700]   Some of these radiators are not,
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.500]   even the more sophisticated vehicles out there
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.100]   don't have a sufficient armoring around the radiator
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.820]   or the battery housing of some of these vehicles.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:48.900]   There was a case of a guy,
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.020]   I think his nickname was El Pelalacas
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.220]   or something like that, out in Sinaloa,
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.540]   level cartel guy, he had an armored vehicle,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.660]   he was riding around and he got ambushed,
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.820]   shot at his car, he was like,
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.340]   "Ah, I have armor, you can't shoot me."
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.620]   And somebody went up to his car
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.580]   and just put the barrel right in the locking mechanism.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.780]   And that got him, you know?
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:14.420]   So it's an interesting place as far as people
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.180]   getting certain types of guns.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.900]   Armor is prolific down there.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.260]   I mean, everybody down there,
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.380]   all the cartel members,
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.980]   you'll see them wearing plate armor.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.540]   So that's an issue.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.340]   It's not like you can shoot somebody square in the chest
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.180]   and it'll go down.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.900]   - Are they afraid to kill Americans?
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:35.020]   So I know, I was traveling in Ukraine on the front,
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.420]   so a lot of the journalists
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.300]   would travel in armored vehicles.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.060]   And at first I was like,
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.700]   "It seems like this would attract attention."
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.620]   It seems like they would want to hit those targets.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:48.540]   But then I realized over time, as I learned,
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.860]   there's a fear of killing Americans.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.020]   There could be a drastic escalation of conflict.
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.620]   - Yeah, it's not worth it.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:56.860]   It's kicking a beehive.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:01.900]   Yeah, there is a tendency to shy away
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.300]   or stay away from that.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.980]   I mean, they don't want the heat or the attention.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.460]   - Outside of that, everyone's game.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.700]   - Everyone's game, but also there's been many cases
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.860]   of Americans being killed down there.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.300]   I mean, we saw the Mormon massacre that happened down there
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:19.580]   and all of them were American, Mexican.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.260]   They had both nationalities and blonde kids,
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:28.460]   white, being massacred in the middle of a desert
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.780]   and the cars basically catching fire.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:35.780]   This happened and the Americans sent the FBI down there
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.540]   to kind of review some of what happened down there.
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.820]   And I think that was when Trump started talking about
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.780]   kind of reviving this whole notion of cartels
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.860]   being labor-related terrorist organization,
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.700]   probably more of a political pressure point
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.420]   he was using to try and get Mexico
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:58.420]   to reinforce its southern border, which it hasn't.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.220]   But there's escalation.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:03.500]   This already happened and nothing happened,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.540]   so we can probably get away with it.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.220]   And again, there's a newer generation moving forward now
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.100]   of people coming into power.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.540]   - More brutal, more technically savvy.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.620]   - Well, they have the experience of their parents
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.500]   and the people behind them and what they've done
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.580]   and what they've gone away with.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:23.100]   And now, yeah, more savvy about information warfare.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.220]   Their main recruiting tool is TikTok.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.460]   You go to TikTok and you'll see a bunch of these kids
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.140]   at a narco party dancing around.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.140]   And some of these are videos by cartel members filming
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.340]   other cartel members in cartel-controlled territory.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.380]   And that's a window into that life for,
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.140]   who's on TikTok now?
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.380]   Kids.
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.580]   - And the enticing aspect of that is the money,
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.620]   the fun, the high roller life.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.780]   - And the possibility of making it to a level.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.620]   - Yeah.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:57.140]   A fame of respect, power, money.
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:01.580]   - Here in the US, somebody might,
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.900]   I want a mansion.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.140]   And I would have like, that's their mindset.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.900]   I want to live like that rapper.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:12.220]   Down there, I mean, if you can buy a house for your mom,
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.700]   or pay off some debts that you might have,
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.820]   or a car, that's enough to kill for.
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:22.060]   - So you also, one of the many things you did is,
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.660]   you did security, tried to protect in this war,
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.020]   try to protect people, high value people.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.820]   How do you do, you and others,
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:32.900]   how is it possible to protect a high value target,
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.700]   like a celebrity, or an important politician
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.580]   in this situation?
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:41.580]   - So I was tasked to protect the governor of Baja
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:42.980]   and his family.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.340]   I was basically replacing a whole contingency
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.980]   of people that were already there,
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.980]   that turned out to be corrupted.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.820]   That wasn't my field, I was operational.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.780]   I was working with other people,
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.140]   doing the counter narcotics stuff,
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.900]   and the director of the institution that I was in,
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:19:59.980]   basically called me and said,
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:03.700]   "Hey, you're gonna go and replace these people."
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.940]   And I, what happened to them?
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:05.780]   Well.
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.900]   - So you were known as a person
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.540]   that could be kind of trusted.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.700]   - I was tasked for that, so I think they considered that.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:17.700]   And I specifically worked for a governor named
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.060]   Jose Guadalupe Osuna-Millan,
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.420]   who was probably one of the best governors
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.660]   we have had in the state.
[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:26.660]   And people wanna see if I'm trustworthy or not,
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.620]   they can ask him directly.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.700]   And I still speak to some members of his family,
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.300]   and we're still friends in that way.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:37.380]   - Is protecting people technically a difficult problem?
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.460]   - For my experience in that time and place,
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:45.380]   he was basically spearheading the drug war in Baja
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.380]   when he was in power.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.300]   So he had threats from all over,
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.060]   not only him, but his family.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.060]   First thing I realized working that job in Mexico
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.580]   is that we had people coming in
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.700]   to do specialized training of that regard,
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.940]   Israelis, teaching us how they would do things in Israel.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.220]   That didn't make a lot of sense for us in Mexico.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.980]   We had people that had some Secret Service experience
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.340]   kind of showing us how they would do celebrity,
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:17.180]   bodyguarding somebody maybe in California of that nature.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.660]   Didn't make sense for us.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.940]   Then we got to experience some cross-training
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:24.660]   with NSW, Naval Special Warfare people,
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.980]   who were coming off protection details
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.740]   in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:31.580]   - Is there some useful crossover there?
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.020]   - We were struggling with the acceptance
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:36.340]   that we were basically doing protection details
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.980]   in a war zone.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.980]   - So the approach that had to be taken in Mexico
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.380]   was similar to the approach you would take
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:45.660]   in Afghanistan during a war?
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.180]   - Some of the overt militaristic type approaches
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.060]   to security that we had to adopt,
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:54.220]   from we didn't move him in a single armored vehicle.
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:56.780]   We had two of them that looked exactly alike.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:58.140]   So when we would move around,
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:01.140]   we would switch one car through the other every now
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.300]   and then we would arrive to an event.
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.020]   They would open the door and it would be one of us.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.580]   And they were like, "Hey, where's the governor?
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.460]   He's in the back one."
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:08.500]   So we would move to that.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.660]   So we had to do stuff like that.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.460]   And again, this is a young me
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.380]   who didn't have any specialized training.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:19.260]   I was on YouTube learning some of these things,
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.580]   going online, learning about armored vehicles,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.460]   learning about architectural armor.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.900]   - I think you just described a large percentage
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.980]   of the Ukrainian military, how they operate,
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.060]   which is on YouTube,
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.940]   trying to figure out how to use some of this technology.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.020]   And that's actually incredibly effective.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:34.860]   - Yeah.
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:37.780]   - I do quite a lot of stuff where I'm totally not an expert,
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.420]   totally uneducated and so on.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.100]   It's kind of surprising how quickly you can get caught up.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.740]   As we were talking offline, if you take a course,
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.940]   if you talk to an expert, if you learn from an expert,
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.900]   you can catch up really quickly.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.700]   For me, it was all of a sudden,
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.020]   I have this director calling me in
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.140]   and I'm wearing Vans, you know, in jeans, you know.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:56.980]   - Yeah.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:57.820]   - T-shirt.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.460]   And all of a sudden I had 80 some people
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.940]   that I had to move around.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:05.060]   And I was in charge of securing planes,
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:07.860]   which I, what do I know about that?
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:11.540]   Airport hangers, armored vehicle maintenance
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.340]   and purchasing and figuring out how to set up
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.700]   a counter assault group for a protection detail.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.180]   And I was like, where am I gonna learn all this?
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.140]   - Were you able to quickly figure some of these things out?
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.780]   - On the fly, basically, you know, as I was going,
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.420]   I remember having this experience,
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.980]   being in the, our security office on my laptop,
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.500]   figuring out how to set up a counter surveillance
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.620]   aside to our protection detail.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.980]   Basically how to have people looking for people
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.860]   that might be looking for us, you know, type thing.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:48.860]   And then going to San Diego to Coronado
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:54.540]   and training with some people from former SEAL guys
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:58.860]   and NCIS people who did that job in war zones
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:02.580]   and seeing them critique some of the solutions
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.540]   that we came up with on the fly and being like,
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.420]   oh, we never saw that before.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:08.540]   Oh yeah, this is, we're doing it down there.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:11.020]   So getting that compliment
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.820]   and also getting their feedback.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.980]   Like we probably do this or do that.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:19.060]   And it was a learning process on the fly that was pretty,
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.900]   I mean, seat of your pants level.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.980]   - Is it possible for the family
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:26.900]   and for the high value person to have a sense of normalcy,
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.740]   to have a normal life?
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:28.860]   - I mean, I tried.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.460]   I was already starting off on the wrong foot basically,
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.660]   because trust had been violated
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.140]   by the people that I was replacing.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:37.380]   So I had to gain that back.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:40.860]   Then young kids in that family that wanted to have a,
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.540]   you know, go out and stuff like that.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:45.420]   In the most violent city on the planet.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.340]   So I had to do my homework and figure out places
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.540]   where they were safe to go to
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:53.540]   and make friends with certain club owners
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.780]   and figure out ways to put security in some of these places.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:00.380]   And having to create this bubble of normalcy
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:03.300]   around some of these people was pretty difficult.
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:08.300]   And there's no way that that is a normal for anybody.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:11.900]   And, you know, God bless them.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.660]   I know it wasn't easy
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.220]   and I know that it affected their lives
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:19.460]   and they lost on a big part of their youth.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.380]   Being under that security supervision and bubble
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:27.140]   does probably does a lot for somebody specifically
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.300]   growing up like that.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:33.060]   You know, you lose opportunities of things
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.940]   that we take for granted, you know, just going out,
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:38.180]   just not telling anybody and going to the store, you know,
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.900]   because you want to get some snacks or something like that.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.460]   That's not available to some of these people.
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:44.580]   - I have to be honest, when I was in Ukraine,
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.740]   that was a really big benefit.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.620]   - You'd escape?
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:47.700]   - No, I couldn't hang out.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.580]   I couldn't eat when I'm stressed.
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.060]   I would fast and not eat much.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:52.420]   So I get lost weight.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:53.260]   So it's great.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.180]   It's great for the diet.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.180]   - That's a good diet to be in.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.620]   Basically be under protective custody.
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:00.460]   That's a good idea for a good new diet.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.300]   - And just life.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.820]   It allowed me to focus, get a lot of reading done,
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.780]   focus on the important things in life.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:09.020]   I mean, I joke, of course,
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:13.740]   but there's some complexity to this
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.060]   in terms of normalcy of the family,
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.180]   but also just how to operate,
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:22.020]   like have a mental clarity and a lack of fear.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.900]   Just basically be good at your job, whatever that job is,
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:28.300]   as a politician, as a leader, even as a soldier.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.620]   - Somebody that I, again, I think it was Lisa Ola,
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:32.740]   she said this to me,
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:35.140]   or said something like this to a group of us,
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.180]   that there's nothing wrong with being paranoid.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.780]   It's about educating your paranoia.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.380]   And knowing what to be afraid of.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.980]   If you're afraid of everything,
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:44.620]   you're basically overwhelmed.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.460]   But if you start educating yourself
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.620]   as far as specifically what to prioritize,
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.940]   as far as what to worry about,
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:54.300]   in a war zone, working, protecting somebody,
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.020]   you're not looking at everybody's faces,
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.380]   you're just looking at their hands,
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.060]   because that's what's gonna kill you.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:03.100]   That's an example of focalizing what you're paranoid
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.460]   and what you're afraid of.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.540]   - So looking at the hands,
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.060]   that's specific to a particular situation.
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:11.980]   But also figuring out which situations to avoid
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:13.420]   and which is okay.
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.740]   I mean, that's like ultimately
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.500]   one of the biggest things you could do.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:18.700]   - Route analysis.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.940]   You have to get to the airport
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.700]   and you send off two cars to analyze two routes.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:28.180]   And then on the fly, you just change trajectory
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.740]   to create randomness and unpredictability,
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:35.240]   and have that as a security feature.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:40.020]   Having a convoy of four vehicles
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.100]   separate into two convoys
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.300]   and show up in different parts to, again,
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:47.940]   make it hard for people to guess where you're gonna be.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.380]   Putting out false information
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:50.820]   as far as where it's gonna be,
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:53.180]   who's gonna be, and that type of stuff.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.460]   - It's kind of amazing how many assassination attempts
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.060]   Hitler avoided just by having a pretty strict schedule
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.980]   and being a little bit off in terms of timing.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.060]   Just like showing up 15 minutes late
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.060]   or to a slightly different location.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.740]   - We were going through training
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.420]   specifically around this type of stuff
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:12.100]   and operational training,
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.740]   basically showing us how to ambush people.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:18.700]   When I started making a group for myself
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.340]   as far as counter ambush,
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.700]   this CAT teams, they call them up here in the US,
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:27.500]   basically a group to respond to a high violent ambush.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.700]   First off, the first rule,
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.860]   if you find yourself in an ambush,
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.560]   it wasn't a successful ambush
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.300]   because if you find yourself in it, you're alive.
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.460]   - Yes.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.940]   - But if you wanna create an amazing counter ambush team,
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.380]   you have to make them ambushers.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.780]   And with ambushing, you figure out
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.060]   where all the opportunities
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:50.100]   of not only successfully doing what you need to do
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:53.100]   are in your favor, but also to escape with your life.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:57.340]   We're not gonna be received by virgins in heaven.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.180]   That's not the type of mentality that we had down there.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:03.260]   But we started learning about some of these things
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:05.380]   and also seeing cartel forces
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.960]   apply some of these ambush tactics
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.340]   to the military or the federal forces.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.300]   - What is an ambush?
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:11.180]   What are we talking about?
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.780]   So that's a surprise attack
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.860]   with an asymmetry of power kind of thing?
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:16.660]   - There's a contingency somewhere
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.760]   moving towards a place that you control and own,
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.980]   where you have the advantages,
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:24.420]   where they can't see you, but you can see them,
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.620]   where they can't predict you,
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.520]   but you can predict where they're gonna pass,
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.500]   go through places where they forcibly have to pass,
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.060]   places where they're predictable,
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.740]   places where you can not only predict,
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.440]   but also have a plan for yourself
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.740]   to escape and exit that place.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.420]   - So how do you train for counter ambush?
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:44.220]   - You turn into a perfect ambusher.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.580]   That's how you train for counter ambush.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.020]   - Also always trying to make sure
[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:49.860]   you have more information about other people.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.460]   You have the element of surprise, all of those things.
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.620]   - And Musashi would say, "Know your enemy, know his sword."
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.280]   Basically that, it's simplified.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.340]   - There's a lot of enemies around you in Mexico.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:02.740]   There's a lot of uncertainty, right?
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.980]   'Cause it's, well, I guess that's what route analysis is.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:08.660]   - Yeah, you prepare for the probable.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.180]   And if the impossible happens,
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:13.220]   you're halfway out of it, hopefully.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.580]   And if you find yourself in an ambush,
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:15.940]   it wasn't a successful one.
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:20.620]   As far as our training and the mindset,
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.820]   my experience with it,
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:25.980]   the adversarial thinking part of it
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.860]   has always been a very powerful one.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.820]   I think one that a lot of people ignore,
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.520]   kind of like leave to the wayside.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.060]   Specifically in all conflicts out there,
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.820]   there's a tendency for a military force
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.420]   or a conventional force of any kind
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.300]   to be trained in a way where they dehumanize the enemy.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.620]   And when that happens,
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:45.700]   you become blind to the enemy's story,
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.920]   it's his capability, his story, his ability.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.500]   If you treat the other side like an inhuman monster,
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.760]   it's hard to take notes.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.620]   - So there's a part of this is a radical empathy
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.340]   for the quote unquote enemy.
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.260]   - At least for me personally,
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.380]   I wasn't one of the guys that would grab them,
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:07.220]   beat the shit out of them,
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:08.300]   put them in the back of a van,
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.220]   just tie them up and gag them.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:12.260]   - So you were able to see them as human?
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.740]   - I learned that from my mother.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:16.420]   She said, "Nobody's against you, Ed,
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.660]   "they're for themselves.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.860]   "Learn this and you will make friends of enemies."
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.700]   She said that when I graduated
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.540]   and I carried that with me throughout my whole career.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.580]   - But isn't there then a pain of killing another human?
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.740]   - Always.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.220]   But there isn't, again,
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.740]   I apologize to go back to Ukraine,
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.260]   it's my only experience of this kind of harshness.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.980]   - And it is a powerful experience.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.660]   - There's a dehumanization that happens.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.940]   I suppose this is common in war.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:46.340]   There's something like a video game aspect
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.300]   where people are almost having fun,
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.820]   there's a humor,
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.540]   and I think underneath that,
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.140]   the prerequisite is to see the enemy
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:55.540]   in the same way you see the enemy
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:56.860]   when you play "Call of Duty."
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.460]   You don't really think,
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:01.220]   you think of them as NPCs, the bad guys.
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.860]   The Russians are called orcs in Ukraine.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.300]   I mean, there's all kinds of other names.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.380]   - For us, it was mugrosos,
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:11.060]   malandros mugrosos, like dirty people.
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.180]   There's always something.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.380]   - Over time, those are just words,
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.660]   but over time, it gathers a kind of,
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.980]   like a meaning to it
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.780]   that's more than just the words, orcs.
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:24.500]   They're less than human.
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.940]   They're dirty, they're too dumb
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.500]   to understand the evil they're doing,
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.900]   or whatever the--
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.420]   - It's useful, it's useful.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.260]   It's part of the program.
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.620]   - But like, that's what,
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:35.300]   I've talked to soldiers,
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.540]   and some of them do have stories
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:40.940]   of momentarily remembering
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.900]   that there's a human on the other side.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.140]   I talked to one woman
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:48.300]   who's this really badass soldier,
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:53.420]   she saw this really brave soldier on the other side
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:57.900]   do something that was almost stupid,
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.740]   how brave it was.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.740]   And then she was trying to shoot him,
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:03.420]   and she missed.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:06.820]   And she said she couldn't sleep the night after,
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:09.900]   thinking, why did she miss?
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:11.460]   Why did she miss?
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.660]   And then she thought she missed
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.140]   because he was a hero.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.140]   And she had this brief realization
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:19.900]   that there was a hero on the other side.
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.820]   The other side is heroes.
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.620]   But then that quickly disappeared.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:25.660]   Again, but she had this moment,
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:27.780]   there's a human being that rises
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.260]   to defend his nation,
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.620]   to defend his people,
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.620]   and he could be heroic on the other side.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.620]   - There are things that we're trained to depress,
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:38.820]   or conceal, or hide, and kill in us
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.700]   when you're trained for something like that.
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.340]   Or when you're in a conflict zone like that,
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:44.460]   and you hear the narrative constantly being blared out
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.500]   that the other side is a orc,
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.100]   or whatever word you wanna use.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.300]   But we live in a day and age
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.780]   when you can see Americans going off to Japan
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:58.180]   and shaking hands with some of their former enemies.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.380]   I mean, some of us have seen that.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.100]   And how things change.
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.340]   I think years from now,
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:05.900]   a lot of the stuff that we are taking right now
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.140]   is of the utmost importance, won't matter anymore.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.140]   - The question is how many years?
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:14.300]   That's a question I ask of a lot of people
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.700]   in that part of the world.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.940]   And a lot of them currently,
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.500]   they're also self-aware about it.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.860]   They're like, "I'm not sure I trust my current feelings."
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.660]   But the current feelings are generational.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:31.620]   Like for decades, I will not just hate the leadership,
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.860]   I will hate all of Russian people.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.820]   - I can't understand that on my side of my life experience,
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.540]   because our war has been an internal war
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.420]   amongst our people, amongst our houses.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:43.580]   - While that is the propaganda,
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.460]   there's also a deep grain of truth
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:48.620]   that there is a oneness to the people of that region.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:49.460]   - Yeah.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:52.260]   - But people will get very offended at that idea,
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:56.260]   because right now it's a very strong nationalist borders.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.460]   But there is a cultural history that connects people.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.900]   I mean, in some deep sense, we're all connected.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.820]   We all come from Western Africa,
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:06.460]   and then all came from fish before then,
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:11.460]   depending on your view of history, of life on earth.
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:15.820]   But there is a oneness to us,
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.860]   and often you forget that in conflict.
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:21.820]   - I had an experience working.
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:24.420]   There was a friend of mine who took the other path,
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:28.900]   and went to work for some of these criminal groups.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.820]   I was operational, and I was,
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:35.940]   we saw a bunch of people in a gas station, parked.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.980]   Back then, the main modus operandi that they had
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.700]   was that they would impersonate
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.460]   or dress up as federal police.
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.340]   And that's how they would move around the city.
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:53.780]   We saw these suburbans in a gas station,
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.780]   and some of the guys were carrying around AK-47s.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.900]   And that's not a standard issue firearm.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:04.900]   So we saw that, and I got off on foot,
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:09.900]   and walked by to try and get a better sense
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.820]   of what was going on.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.440]   I took everything off, wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.120]   And I got a whistle from one of the guys that was there,
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.880]   and my name was called.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.480]   It was one of the guys that I grew up with.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.720]   Redhead kid, looked like El Canelo, you know?
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.160]   There's redheads in Mexico, by the way.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.520]   I think it's probably some of the Irish
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.160]   that betrayed the American side
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.880]   during the last Mexico-American War
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.120]   that stayed down there, had a bunch of kids.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.360]   It's probably from there.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.960]   - Love is stronger than anything else, I think.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.480]   - This redhead kid, when I say kid, I mean he was my age.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.320]   Now, to my eyes, he's always gonna be younger now.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.960]   He whistled, told my name.
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:58.240]   Said, "Hey, (speaking in foreign language)
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.080]   "What are you doing here?"
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.200]   I was like, "Oh, shit, I'm just going home.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.360]   "I'm still going to get a taxi."
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.520]   Said, "Oh, okay."
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.000]   He walked, as he walks over,
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   he has a plate carrier with AK-round magazines on his chest.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.800]   AK without a stock on it, just carrying it in his hand.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.800]   He comes over and he hugs me.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.520]   I could feel the magazines on my chest.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.320]   Mind you, I have a gun on me, tucked.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.280]   And next to him is buzzing in my back pocket
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:34.760]   as people are trying to figure out what the fuck's going on.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:39.040]   He asked me, small talk shit, like, "Hey, what are you doing?
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.280]   "What do you work at?"
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.840]   I was like, "Oh, I'm just looking for a job.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.360]   "I used to work at a video store."
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:47.000]   So he's like, "I haven't seen you in a while.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.160]   "How's so-and-so of your family?"
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.000]   "Good."
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.840]   "How's so-and-so of your family?"
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.120]   "Good."
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.400]   It's like, yeah, this is an interesting job you have.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.800]   He's like, "Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.240]   "They pay us well.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.240]   "You get a car, there's money,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.360]   "and nobody fucks with you.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.440]   "You get respect."
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.800]   I was like, "That's awesome.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.840]   "If you want, I can get you in.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.680]   "If you ever want that."
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:15.440]   I was like, "Oh, I'm too much of a coward for that," I told him.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:19.760]   - Conversation like any other between two friends.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.520]   - He hugs me before I go.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.320]   I said something to him, I can't remember what.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.320]   And he says, "Hey," in my ear,
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.720]   "I know what you do for a living.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.600]   "It's not a safe place for you to be in."
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.800]   And I walk off.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.880]   A few moments later, the army showed up.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:46.440]   And you could feel the amount of rounds
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.960]   going off from two blocks away.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:59.160]   We came back with our guys, and it was over.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.960]   - So he didn't survive that?
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:07.000]   - I looked through the bodies and the cars.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.200]   They were left, there was bodies all over the place.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.360]   People left there.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.560]   It was a mess.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.960]   I spent like an hour looking for him.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:23.480]   The only way I could recognize him was his hair.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:29.640]   I stayed with his body all night.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.640]   There's a bridge in Tijuana that goes over the river
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.560]   and a place called La Mesa.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.440]   And that's where the forensic offices were.
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.000]   His body was taken there,
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.800]   and I stayed with his body until it was released.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.200]   I told his family about it.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.160]   'Cause I knew them.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.440]   That aspect of us versus them,
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.520]   or they're the enemy and shit like that.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.520]   And my mom told me those words,
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.600]   "Nobody's against you, they're just for themselves.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.920]   "So don't make the mistake of dehumanizing anybody."
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:06.480]   - And those roles could have been easily reversed.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.960]   - I could have been shot in the face there.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.680]   That aspect of conflict brings where, let's say,
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.320]   bad guys, good guys, heroes, villains.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.400]   There's an innocence to that that goes away.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.800]   - Is your mom still with us?
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.600]   - No, almost three weeks before I decided to quit,
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.160]   she passed away.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.560]   - Did that have a role to play?
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.520]   - A major one.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.800]   After I got done on the protection detail with the governor,
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:41.320]   like everything down there, again, the whole cycle,
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.160]   he got his turn.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.360]   So when he went away, politics change.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.480]   And down there, basically,
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.320]   if you're a gubernatorial candidate,
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:56.120]   you have either a friend of a friend or a family member
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.800]   be the head bodyguard guy.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.080]   And the guy that won the elections
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.760]   had his head bodyguard guy already there.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:06.800]   So all of us were sent back to whatever we came from.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.880]   So I went back to work on the streets.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:12.040]   I was back on the operations group.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.560]   I was working with the sub-director directly with him,
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:18.840]   basically, back on the ground doing the stuff
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:21.000]   that I was doing before that job.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.400]   We were moving away from the successes
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.560]   that had been had by people like Lazola
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.480]   when they were in charge of that whole process,
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.640]   the people that I used to work with.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.360]   Some of the only successes in that counter push
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.000]   against cartels in Mexico,
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.040]   and you can kind of like, it's documented,
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.240]   you can read about it out there.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.160]   A bunch of people wrote papers on it.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.600]   Some of the only successes were had by Lazola
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.160]   in the places where he had leadership.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.040]   He not only pacified Tijuana,
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.080]   he also did the same in Juarez.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.600]   He was sent to be the police chief in Juarez too.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.320]   But politics change and heroes become villains.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.560]   A lot of people started calling him a villain
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.120]   because of his unorthodox approach
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.960]   and human rights violations and all this type of stuff
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:09.440]   kind of come to the forefront.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.880]   And people forgot, you know,
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.080]   people forgot what it took to get Tijuana
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.440]   off the most dangerous city list on the planet.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.360]   And people were vilified, people like him.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.680]   And the police force that I was a part of
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.600]   started getting compromised.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.160]   A lot of the things that were put forth
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.760]   to try and keep us honest.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.040]   There was a program, they had these centers called C3s.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.320]   Basically you would go there every year,
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.760]   you would get your financials checked,
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.560]   you would get a physical, psychological evaluation,
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.400]   you would get a polygraph exam done on you,
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.680]   all the works to try and see if you were somebody
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.480]   doing something wrong.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.920]   And all of that was canceled
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.520]   because it violated your human rights.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.920]   If you get fired from a job
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.560]   because of a failed polygraph exam,
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.080]   because that was not an actual admissible
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.120]   way of firing somebody.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.520]   So all of a sudden you had people
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.120]   that were known cartel compromised people
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.080]   that were fired five, six years ago,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.120]   showing back up to work,
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.200]   with their back paid and everything.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:23.120]   So this started happening and I quickly realized
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.320]   that it was gonna be hard to stay there.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:32.240]   I was driving home from work
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:34.000]   and I got a call from my brother
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.320]   that my mom had been going through some health issues
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.120]   that had turned into psychiatric issues.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.120]   So we were basically taking turns trying to take care of her,
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.160]   locking the door so she wouldn't wander off
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.000]   and stuff like that.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:57.240]   Not only was I dealing with the job on the street,
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.560]   but I was dealing with that.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.920]   And also I had a two year old
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.920]   and a marriage that was difficult, that had time.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.720]   So I was trying to figure all these things out.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.440]   - Made more difficult by your job?
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:16.400]   - Yeah, it's not a financially secure job,
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:19.320]   and the pressures that it has and the odd hours
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.960]   and all that made it really hard.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:25.800]   And then all of a sudden my brother calls me
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.040]   and tells me that, "Let's go to the hospital."
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.240]   And something happened to my mom.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.960]   It wasn't my turn to watch her,
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:37.320]   so I felt pretty shitty about that.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:43.200]   I got to the hospital and the doctors came out
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.160]   and told us that she was gone.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.840]   It was a massive heart attack.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.600]   She had a pacemaker by then, so she was gone.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:59.920]   She was in her 60s, so we kind of expected something,
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:06.080]   but not, that was hard for me.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.880]   She was my center.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.680]   She was gonna be the one that I would ask for advice
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.800]   as far as work, as far as she'd leave it or not.
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.800]   - The ground was removed from under you.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   - There was nobody, yeah, there's nothing underneath me.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.440]   I get three days off work, that's what they gave me.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:29.160]   I'm trying to grieve as I go back to work.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.280]   Dark shit crosses my mind as I'm going through that process
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.920]   of trying to figure things out.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.840]   - Dark shit like suicide, dark shit?
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.680]   - Yeah.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.960]   - So it was very low for you, it hit very hard.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.760]   - Yeah, I wasn't allowed to grieve basically,
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.880]   and I wasn't allowed to grieve for a few years
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:49.980]   for different reasons.
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:52.480]   I went back to work and--
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.880]   - You weren't allowed, other people,
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.040]   also you yourself were not allowing yourself to grieve.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.680]   - There was other people with me
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.360]   that didn't allow me to grieve.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.400]   I went to work, got called into the office,
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:07.960]   and I was basically told that I was gonna be reassigned
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:10.120]   after what I just went through.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.080]   The reassignment was going to be something
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:18.080]   that I saw as unacceptable.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.880]   It was, the people in charge at that point
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:25.240]   were obviously corrupted,
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.640]   and what I got from their conversation
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:31.620]   was that they wanted us to work for a specific side.
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:37.800]   And I knew that that was the time to go.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.040]   I asked for a license, basically a license
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.160]   is unpaid absence from work, basically,
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.720]   leave of absence, I think it's what you call it up here,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:52.720]   which by law is allowed, and I was denied for no reason.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.640]   So I'm invested in this job, you know,
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   I have a good salary, and I have a category in there,
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:09.180]   so by the level of time you spend in there,
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:12.820]   you get a category, so I was a pretty high category agent.
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:16.880]   I had all this training, and again,
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:19.360]   training that would be useless in the private sector,
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.000]   well, in the public sector in Mexico,
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.440]   I couldn't change from one corporation to another,
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.240]   I couldn't go to work for another police institution, so.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:33.080]   I took a deep breath, and I resigned.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.760]   I went to the office, I said, "I need to resign."
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.120]   They said, "What?"
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:37.960]   I need to resign.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.240]   Some of the people in the office that knew me
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:41.600]   from a long time were like, "What's wrong with you?"
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.840]   They thought I was having a mental breakdown.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.460]   Handed all over all the paperwork,
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:51.320]   took a big trash bag, put all my stuff in there,
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.080]   plate armor, tear gas grenades, gas mask,
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:01.080]   satellite radio, MP5 magazines, an MP5 submachine gun,
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.940]   Glock, Glock magazines, all of it, helmet,
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.340]   and I handed it over in the armory,
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:13.040]   and I left.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.660]   I made some phone calls.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:21.600]   I was married to an American, and my daughter's American.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.400]   I never envisioned myself coming to the United States,
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.960]   do that process for myself, you know,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.760]   'cause I was invested in that job.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:32.600]   I thought I was gonna die or retire from that.
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:37.940]   And it quickly became like an issue
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:39.260]   because everybody was wondering
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.380]   why I left the job so abruptly.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:45.220]   So there were some threats made when I left
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:49.260]   by people inside the office, and I probably,
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:50.940]   you know, it's anonymous shit.
[01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:53.300]   - So there's significant pressure not to leave.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:55.020]   It's hard to leave this kind of job.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:55.860]   - Yeah.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.820]   - The system makes it difficult to leave.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:01.740]   The individuals, to the degree they might be corrupted,
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:03.060]   really don't want you to leave.
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.140]   - There's no support, yeah, there's no support.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:06.780]   - And it's probably the opposite of support.
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:07.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:11.700]   - Almost like implied or explicit or implicit threats.
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.060]   - Yeah.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:16.060]   Luckily, I had developed some friendships
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.020]   in the United States with some of the people
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:20.980]   that I used to work with and cross-train with,
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.880]   and some friendships that I developed with people
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.120]   that I would just talk to and make friends with stateside.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.940]   One of them is a Navy SEAL reservist
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:36.500]   whose name is Dan Stanchfield and his wife, Kelly.
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:40.220]   They opened the doors of their house to me
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:43.400]   and my kid and my wife at that time.
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:49.180]   As I seek to basically look for the American dream,
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:55.060]   I crossed the border with my kid,
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:57.620]   and nobody knew anything, you know.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:00.820]   I didn't tell anybody, just, you know, my wife.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:03.820]   And I was off.
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:08.900]   When I came to the States, I already kind of dabbled
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.580]   in the whole training field and showing
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.480]   some of my experience to people.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:17.420]   So I had at least a seed of that out there.
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:18.720]   People knew me for that.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:24.420]   But all of a sudden, I was in the middle
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:29.420]   of an avocado orchard in the middle of California
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:31.460]   and everything's quiet.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:36.460]   And there's no more radios going off all of the night.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:39.820]   There's no more three cell phones on the counter.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.820]   There's no guns, there's no rifles,
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:46.820]   there's no 80 people calling to see what's going on.
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:50.020]   There's nothing, it's just quiet.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.860]   And it's during the time when Trump got elected,
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:57.260]   so the immigration process that usually would take
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:02.260]   I had most things going for me.
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:04.900]   The immigration process that would take
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:07.660]   at most a year took two years.
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:12.660]   So it was not an easy process to not only come to the US,
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:19.260]   but come to the US with that pressure,
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:22.060]   kind of underlying pressure as far as being an immigrant
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:23.580]   at that time here.
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:26.860]   - And then your own personal psychological, the PTSD,
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:31.680]   of going from a war zone to a avocado orchard.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:37.940]   - The word PTSD and TBI and all of these things,
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.800]   I didn't know any of them.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.980]   It was through people that I got to meet
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:48.900]   in the training field that were Marines, SEALs,
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:52.900]   Marisoc guys, those types of people
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:55.700]   that started giving words to some of the things
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:58.300]   that I felt, which I didn't really know.
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:02.020]   We would treat post-traumatic stress
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.780]   with alcohol and vacation time.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.020]   A bottle of Mezcal.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:09.940]   When you see the bottom of it, your troubles are gone.
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:10.780]   - Cured.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:11.940]   - Yeah, immediately.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:16.540]   I was an alcoholic as well as all of the other stuff.
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:20.700]   I was drinking myself to sleep every third night.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:24.900]   My marriage obviously was failing.
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:28.500]   It wasn't easy for her.
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:32.460]   She was brave and she did what she could.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:36.260]   And I totally respect and understand her process with it.
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:41.260]   But when it's quiet, that's when it hits you.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:44.100]   I think that's what a lot of people experience
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:46.200]   when they come back from a conflict zone.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:50.620]   Everything that was life and death,
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:53.260]   everything that mattered, all the noise, all the chaos,
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.380]   all the people that are around you that would die for you,
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:57.700]   kill for you, you would kill for them.
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:01.940]   All the millions of dollars worth of equipment
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:03.460]   and stuff like that you were responsible for
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:07.660]   now are all gone and it's just you walking into a Circle K
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:09.980]   and buying three cans of Fosters
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.700]   to drink yourself to sleep.
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:15.620]   - Yeah, you write on your Patreon brilliantly
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:21.980]   about BTSD, about the cost of things you've done and seen.
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:26.900]   Quote, "When it's over and we're far from that chaos
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.020]   and noise of death being close and life being real,
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:34.400]   that is when some of us remember in the quiet nights
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.300]   in a field in Tennessee, looking at fireflies,
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:41.020]   walking through a fair, holding hands with a lover,
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:43.240]   asking you what's wrong.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:46.220]   At your kid's birthday party,
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.460]   leave early to avoid the ending of a celebration.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:52.580]   That is what the quiet means to some of us."
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:55.660]   So that's speaking to that silence, the quiet.
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:57.820]   How do you live with and thrive
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:01.900]   with this newly learned term of PTSD?
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.900]   - If anything, I would recommend people
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:06.460]   that have any of these issues to go to places
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:08.660]   where other people have their issues.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.040]   So you can, it's not a competition,
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.180]   but you get to see the scope of problems in the world
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:17.660]   and you sometimes feel kind of lucky as far as your own.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.460]   - Like it humbles you. - Yeah.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:21.440]   - It makes you appreciate all the different kinds
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:22.780]   of struggles that people go through.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I went through some horrible shit,
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:26.700]   but there's some people there that went through
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:29.980]   more horrible shit or stuff that I don't think
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:31.460]   I could have survived.
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.420]   When I went through that process of figuring things out,
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:36.860]   you know, the first thing that glaringly pointed out
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.860]   or stuck out to me was my inability to process things.
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:46.420]   Like there was a big pause button there, a giant one.
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:48.320]   Everything was on pause.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.360]   My grieving, not only my mom, but my brother.
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:56.380]   So I had a pause button on me, so I was 13 basically.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:55:02.020]   Then I got to bury many of my friends
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:06.740]   and inform their wives or girlfriends of what happened.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.680]   And that all again was paused
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:14.580]   because I wasn't allowed to process.
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:17.000]   You know, I spent years without going on vacation
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.620]   because I was a workaholic.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:25.140]   And I found at the core of my issues, alcohol.
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:28.660]   A giant pause button in the form of alcohol.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.780]   Basically I would drink my problems away
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:35.020]   or specifically I would, it's like if you have a mess
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:37.100]   in your house, you just put a big tarp over it,
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.740]   you know, to cover it up and alcohol was that for me.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:45.700]   And it festered more and more as I not only went
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.240]   through the process of learning about PTSD,
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.360]   going through therapy, but refusing to let that go.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.720]   You know, like going through therapy
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.600]   and seeing what other people's problems were.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.840]   And I don't wanna, you know, this is the only thing I have.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.440]   I'm not, you know, I'm not hurting anybody with it,
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:05.180]   you know, why do I need to get rid of that?
[01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:08.360]   By this point I was traveling across the country
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:11.640]   and training people and showing some of the experiences
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.240]   that I had to other people, speaking, being on podcasts
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.700]   and having conversations like the one I'm having with you.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.300]   - So speaking to the skills that you've developed.
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:23.180]   - And in a way basically reliving and reopening
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:25.480]   a bunch of shit for myself every time I do it.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.580]   So it was, I was getting triggered
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.640]   and the way I would manage that was I would drink,
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.340]   you know, at the end of the night,
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:36.760]   after a weekend class somewhere,
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:40.320]   when I talk about the fireflies in a field in Tennessee,
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:43.460]   it was a moment where I was forcing myself
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:46.420]   to try and be sober and we did this medical class out
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:51.380]   in the hills in Tennessee, a beautiful green place,
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:55.120]   beautiful family there that hosted us.
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.060]   And it's the first time I ever saw fireflies.
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:58.940]   So I was like, I thought I was having
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:01.180]   a hallucinogenic experience when I say,
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:04.020]   why is the wire, why is the dust glowing?
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:06.240]   You know, is what I thought.
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:09.580]   A friend of mine is a veteran,
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:12.500]   he's ran off to the woods and grabbed one
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.460]   and brought it to me and showed it to me.
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:16.100]   I was like, holy shit, what is that?
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.740]   That's a firefly.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:19.140]   Wow, how do they glow?
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:20.380]   I don't know.
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:23.500]   And he's crushing it in his hand and said, it's gone.
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:26.420]   And that, you know, brought me back immediately
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:29.820]   to holy shit, you know, it kind of like,
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:33.860]   I was off somewhere and I was back and I had to go drink.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:37.620]   I went through that process of like going off
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:40.800]   at getting on and going off, getting off at my marriage.
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:43.300]   Separate.
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:49.460]   And that was another end of the world aspect to everything.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:53.540]   I lost my mother, I lost the job
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:58.540]   and then the marriage failed and it was on me.
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:04.420]   I basically went somewhere
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:08.760]   and did a stock of everything that was going on.
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:15.240]   And made a decision to stop drinking.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:20.160]   Yeah, had some bad relationships after.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.500]   And I just came to a place where I need to stop drinking.
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:27.140]   - You've gotten to a point so low,
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:30.220]   was this a decision you arrived at by yourself?
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:32.340]   Was there some inspiration
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:36.020]   or was it just the point is so low, lost so much?
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.620]   - It was the start of COVID.
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:40.700]   So this is recent, this is probably too,
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:44.560]   I'm gonna have two years sober in December.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:47.700]   - So when you talked to Rogan the first time,
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:49.500]   you're still struggling with this dema.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:51.060]   - I was in and out of the car, basically,
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:52.380]   is what I would say, you know,
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:56.140]   I was in and out of and then trying to get rid of it.
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:58.820]   - That must be a super stressful experience
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:00.300]   talking to Joe Rogan the first time,
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.220]   did you drink that night?
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:03.200]   You remember?
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.220]   - The second time I was there, I went somewhere,
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:08.220]   God shit face.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:12.540]   It was stressful, not for any other reason
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:15.020]   than I felt the responsibility to the people
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:17.300]   that couldn't speak about it.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.460]   So that's the pressure.
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:21.180]   It was the start of COVID
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:24.180]   and things started getting shut down and slowed down.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:28.780]   My dad got really sick and almost died.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:34.140]   We had to set up like some Jason Bourne level shit
[01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:35.980]   at my brother's place.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.620]   He was in Mexico, you know,
[01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:43.140]   so we had to bribe a guy to get us an oxygen tank
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:46.900]   and I had to, Jimmy Reagan, a respirator
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:49.840]   and it was some shit.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:57.500]   But my dad was like, he survived it, you know,
[01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:00.020]   the doctors were like, say goodbye.
[02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:03.020]   And my dad was like, yeah, say goodbye to him, you know.
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:05.420]   (laughing)
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:07.620]   - Okay, so your dad's a gangster, I got it.
[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:09.980]   Tough guy.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.040]   - He did some gangster shit that day.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:16.340]   But on my end, I was being isolated basically
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:18.340]   as COVID is, everybody's slowing down,
[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:21.260]   no more classes, no more excuses to go out there and drink
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:22.640]   and no more socializing.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:25.660]   So social drinking turned into alone drinking
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:26.900]   more and more and more.
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:31.300]   I bought a bottle of gin
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:36.260]   because I was down in Mexico taking care of my dad
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:40.880]   and they closed down beer production in Mexico.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.880]   So beer went away and beer was a way I kind of managed it.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:49.320]   It's not hard alcohol, it's just beer, so you know.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.300]   But that went away so it was just hard alcohol
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:54.260]   that was what was available down there.
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:01:00.100]   One night alone at the house, my dad's house,
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:04.220]   I drank a bottle of gin, a whole bottle of gin.
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.660]   I almost died.
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:10.180]   And after that, you know,
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:15.420]   some people started noticing that I was isolating
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:18.320]   more and more and it was kind of eating away at me.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:23.380]   I was in a relationship at that point
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:25.940]   when I started seeing everything
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:28.460]   just kind of fall apart around me.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:33.460]   And I drank half of a glass of wine
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:41.360]   and it made me sick internally in my mind.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:47.260]   And my kid said to me, and I don't know,
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.500]   nobody coached her, nobody said anything to her.
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:51.780]   She's a pretty intuitive kid.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:54.940]   She said, "I don't drink anymore, Dad."
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:58.420]   And I was out of nowhere in the middle of the night.
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:01.540]   And I stopped.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:04.780]   I stopped that night.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:08.580]   I remember waking up at three in the morning
[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:10.260]   and taking a cooler that I had
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:11.660]   and just dumping all the beers in it
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:14.340]   and chucking them in the garbage
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:17.100]   and with a knife poking each of them
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:20.620]   to not be tempted to go pack for them.
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:23.360]   And then the second day I went around
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.340]   and started finding the hides that I had
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:27.540]   because I had some hides.
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:33.740]   And then I went somewhere and locked myself in for two weeks.
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:43.900]   I had the withdrawals,
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:48.460]   the clearest nightmares that I'd ever had in my life
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:51.420]   for two, three weeks.
[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:54.700]   I went somewhere, I don't want to keep them private,
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:59.700]   but I went somewhere where they offered a place for me.
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:04.300]   And when I asked them about it, it's a community,
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:07.500]   I gave them some money for their school as a donation.
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:10.900]   I gave them like a few thousand dollars.
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:12.500]   I said, "Yeah, sure, come.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.100]   "You can go through this process here.
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:15.900]   "You're cool as fuck, people."
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.580]   The first thing they did when I got there
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:19.280]   is they stood me up in front of everybody
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:21.260]   to thank me for the donation
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:23.580]   and then told everybody that I was an alcoholic.
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:25.140]   And if anybody saw me drinking,
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:27.300]   I was to be kicked out of there immediately.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:33.100]   And I felt horrible.
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:39.380]   So that was where I started.
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.080]   - Is that temptation still there?
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:46.060]   - There was a moment when it was
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:52.700]   and some therapy circle,
[02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:55.780]   there's a rodeo clown friend of mine
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:04:00.220]   who his body's, his spine is basically fused together,
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:01.420]   you know, type of guy.
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:06.340]   We've been friends and enemies and friends again,
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:10.980]   you know, during the art therapy circle sessions.
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:12.740]   - Oh, so like there's an intimacy there.
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.460]   - Yeah, he didn't know anything about me.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:18.420]   One time when we were telling our story,
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:21.580]   he stood up and told his story and then he heard mine
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:23.020]   and then he was pissed off at me
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:25.500]   and didn't wanna talk to me for a while.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:28.100]   And then later he told me that it was because
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.940]   he saw what I did with my experience
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:32.660]   and how much of a difference that he perceived
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:34.700]   that I was making with it.
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:37.780]   And he felt jealous that he couldn't do the same
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:40.660]   with his experience because he was just a broken
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.340]   ex-rodeo clown.
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:45.180]   He told me when I was going through the process,
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:47.660]   like, "Hey, you're an internet celebrity person,
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:49.520]   "you know, you're known."
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.600]   "Aren't you worried about people finding out
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.240]   "that you're recovering drunk?"
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.080]   And I said, "Yeah, it's fucking scary as shit
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.920]   "if people find out that I am going through this process.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.740]   "It's scary that, you know, the critique,
[02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:04.940]   "you know, I already get a lot of shit
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:07.180]   "for being an ex-police officer in Mexico
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:10.080]   "and all the negativity that comes from that."
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:13.680]   And he said, "Don't be.
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.980]   "You know, you can't pickpocket a naked man,
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:18.640]   "so just get naked."
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:20.040]   And what does that mean?
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:22.720]   Write about it, post it online.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.320]   You never know, somebody out there might get inspired
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:27.020]   to do their own kind of process.
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:32.040]   So I started posting about it, cowardly in a way,
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.920]   because I wanted to make other people keep me on the path,
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.520]   you know, but in other ways, you know,
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:42.160]   desperation, you know, I don't wanna drink anymore,
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:44.680]   I don't wanna go back on that path,
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:47.720]   which I know leads directly to a bad death.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:49.920]   I'm not afraid of death, I just want a good one,
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:50.880]   I don't want a bad one.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.180]   I think that was gonna lead me to a bad death.
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:58.000]   I started writing about it and sharing it online,
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.800]   you know, through my Fever Dreams post
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:04.520]   and just being humorous about it online
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:07.960]   and getting a lot of hate on one side, you know,
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:10.380]   having a few people and companies that I work with
[02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:13.400]   kind of step back and seeing this guy has some issues,
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.720]   to having other people kind of make fun of
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:20.000]   or make light of that weakness portrayed.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.040]   - Oh, so getting hate, getting criticism,
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:26.960]   because here you are a counter-narcotics police officer,
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.640]   there's no, has a drinking problem,
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:32.920]   so is that like supposed to be what, like flaws revealed?
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:37.680]   - Weakness or a perception of alpha in the US, I guess,
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:39.600]   that some people have, you know.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:41.640]   - You were supposed to be strong and here you are.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:45.000]   - I mean, I'm not Jocko Willink, I'm not David Goggins,
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.160]   you know, I wake up at 10 in the morning sometimes
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:51.880]   and I'll have cornflakes with my eight-year-old, you know.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.520]   I like days off, I used to wake up at 3.30 in the morning
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:58.600]   every day to review what happened during the night
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:02.320]   and then go off for a jog and then the gym
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.800]   and just be ready to be able to murder somebody
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:07.280]   with my hands if I had to, but that is,
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.600]   I couldn't maintain that during the whole process
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:12.180]   of getting out of it, now leaving alcohol.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:14.520]   I remember just being honest with it
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.960]   and just seeing the two sides of it, you know.
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:22.160]   Joe told me never read the comment section, right?
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:27.000]   Which is a beautiful, it's a beautiful piece of advice,
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000]   but they get you sometimes when you talk about
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.500]   some of these things openly.
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.480]   And some of the comments were positive
[02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:40.840]   and I've been seeing people comment, sending me messages
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:44.060]   and meeting people on the road that are five months in.
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:50.060]   10 months, some people that have been on that wagon
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:52.280]   for way longer than I have.
[02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:58.580]   And there's, it's cool when you meet people
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:04.100]   that are superhuman or perform
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:06.980]   and take an extreme ownership of things
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:10.900]   and are just amazing people that are thriving out there.
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:14.220]   It's inspirational, I see some of these people
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:16.340]   and I'm like, holy shit, I need to figure out
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:19.500]   how to get to some semblance of that, but I'm not that.
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:22.060]   I've been through the ringer,
[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:24.140]   I fucked up a shit ton of times.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:28.980]   My nose is an example of that, a few missing teeth.
[02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:32.780]   But in a way, I think all of that is part of the process
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.700]   that not a lot of people wanna talk about, you know.
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.260]   Independently of the experience I got down there
[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:40.140]   and some of the things that I show and talk about
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:44.180]   and some of the advocacy I do related to women like her
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:47.900]   that are trying to look for a better life
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.000]   and trying to find their missing kids,
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.640]   training people to not get into those situations,
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.620]   but also showcasing the fact that people
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:08:58.460]   that go through some of these processes
[02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:01.120]   have a journey to go through.
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.620]   I just came into your studio with a duffel bag
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:08.060]   straight from the airport and I'm gonna leave
[02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:10.900]   early tomorrow morning to somewhere else.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:14.940]   I've been on the road for almost,
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:17.300]   I think five years nonstop.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.260]   I go back to a specific place every week
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:23.480]   to see my kid for two, three days, and then I'm back out.
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.140]   You know, some people are like, are you running?
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:29.020]   Like, are you worried, are you just afraid about something?
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:33.840]   No, but I am on this weird path, I guess,
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:36.060]   trying to look for something that I think
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:41.060]   I've been missing as far as my afterlife of a sort,
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:42.660]   you know, coming out of that.
[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:43.500]   - What do you think that is?
[02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:44.380]   Are you looking for some kind of
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:46.980]   deeper understanding of humanity?
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:50.220]   Like, from the specific experiences you had
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:52.380]   to get some deeper understanding
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:54.860]   of what the hell we're all doing here?
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:58.140]   - I meet people every weekend with different stories.
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:09:59.660]   You know, people come to some of my classes.
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:02.140]   You know, I show them how to weaponize the environment,
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:05.900]   how to harm themselves, how to not get abducted.
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:07.860]   I meet people that have gone through those experiences
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.440]   and are basically trying to work through
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:10.660]   some of their own issues
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:12.660]   by going through the training like that.
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:16.420]   I get to meet people that are, you know,
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.620]   people that I've only seen online, you know,
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:19.980]   or seen in videos.
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:24.340]   I remember meeting Royce Gracie in "Harbor City."
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:25.720]   - I heard of that guy.
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:27.420]   - He's a pretty interesting character.
[02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:30.220]   I remember seeing him in a bootleg VHS video.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.660]   I told him about it.
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:36.060]   We were doing a class out at Emerson Knives.
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:39.620]   It's a knife company, but Mr. Emerson
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:41.180]   also has like a jujitsu gym there
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:42.580]   where Royce trades out of.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.240]   That's his space.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:48.340]   And, you know, they're teaching how to defend
[02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:49.860]   against somebody trying to stab you.
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:53.660]   And I'm showing them all the ways you can get around that
[02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:57.020]   and fabricate and improvise and smuggle things,
[02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:00.020]   basically the adversarial side of that.
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:01.320]   That's what I'm known for.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.640]   The psychology and kind of the ways that people do that.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.200]   And I remember him seeing some of the stuff
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:10.600]   that I was doing and just being like,
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:11.440]   "Where are you from?"
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:12.280]   "Mexico."
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:15.380]   Makes sense, you know, somebody from Brazil, you know,
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:17.620]   tipping the hat to somebody from Mexico
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:20.600]   as far as him seeing the violence
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.280]   and some of the mentality behind it.
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.640]   - So for people who don't know,
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:29.000]   Royce Gracie is the legendary martial artist
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.160]   that probably introduced Brazilian jiu-jitsu
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:33.080]   to the American audience, to the world,
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:36.080]   to the process of UFC and showing the effectiveness of it
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:40.240]   in practice that a little skinny guy
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:42.520]   can defeat a big aggressive guy.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:47.520]   - An anaconda, a small anaconda walking into that ring
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.360]   with his family behind him.
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.380]   - Wearing pajamas.
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:51.440]   - Wearing pajamas and everybody was like,
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.360]   "What is this guy wearing pajamas for?"
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.340]   And then he would strangle people with those pajamas.
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:58.680]   I remember seeing that and just having it,
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:01.600]   I think probably what a generation before
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:03.240]   had with Bruce Lee, I guess,
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:09.240]   my generation was Royce walking into that octagon
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:12.560]   and changing paradigms.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.400]   Seeing him in that gym,
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:18.560]   it's also an avid gun owner and shooter,
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:20.560]   which is interesting, you know,
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:24.400]   having seeing somebody like him who is well-versed
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.000]   with his hands also be a man that has gone into the realm
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.120]   of being well-versed with weaponry,
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.320]   which is an aspect of martial arts
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:37.320]   and the martial way of thinking that, you know,
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:38.320]   some people kind of,
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.080]   the purist will stick with one side of it,
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.800]   but he's obviously a warrior in a lot of ways.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.680]   - So just as a small tangent,
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:49.280]   so you're somebody that you don't just look
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:52.000]   at unarmed combat, you look at the full spectrum
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.400]   of the chaos of combat that's outside of the realm
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.880]   of jiu-jitsu and even just mixed martial arts.
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:01.800]   Unarmed, armed with knives and beyond.
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.560]   Was his mind open to the fuller spectrum of violence?
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.440]   - Yeah, I mean, he was in the middle of this class
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.080]   that we were doing where people were basically
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:11.920]   focusing on both.
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:15.000]   Ernest Emerson, who's famous for his knives,
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.760]   he has a knife company, he's done knives for NASA,
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:19.360]   you know, not only that,
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.440]   but he's also a very avid martial artist.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:23.640]   He trained with a lot of Filipino martial arts
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:26.120]   related to knives and stuff like that,
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.160]   but a different mindset, you know,
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.200]   a defensive mindset, trying to train people
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:32.000]   how to defend against that.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.760]   And you have Royce, who's, he's from Brazil.
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:36.240]   I mean, he has some street in him.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:38.160]   That's something that, you know, those guys,
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:40.800]   we say in Mexico.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.920]   Seeing the ways he would, he stepped in there
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:47.320]   and provided some encouragement to the people there
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:50.680]   as far as, you know, how people sometimes focus on the,
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:53.720]   this is a system and this is a way,
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:54.880]   but there's other ways out there
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.720]   that might negate or defeat the ways
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.800]   that you are concentrating on, you know?
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.560]   So, kind of get out of that bubble.
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.800]   My whole kind of speciality or what I focus on is mindset
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.600]   and figuring out the software
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:10.000]   that some of these people gain and gather from.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.360]   If I need to arm myself, you know,
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.400]   the easiest thing to manufacture in most places
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.560]   is a pointed object.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:18.960]   So, I can take that crystal big pen
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.320]   that you're writing on that notepad with
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.320]   and using the friction from the carpet,
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:25.600]   I can turn it into a hypodermic needle
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:27.320]   that you can then poke into somebody's neck.
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:28.800]   - What's the process of doing that?
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:30.160]   - I can do it right now if you want.
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.840]   - No, but can you use your words for the listener
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:34.520]   and also 'cause I'm terrified?
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:38.280]   - No, I could, basically you can take the heat
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:39.880]   and friction created from this carpet.
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:40.720]   - Yes.
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:41.880]   - You can grab that pen.
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:43.800]   In and of itself, it will pierce flesh,
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.240]   but it will slow itself down
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:48.560]   because it has a few angles on the tip.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.000]   - Oh, you wanna wear down the angles.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.320]   - So, if you take that tip off and you grab it
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.680]   and then grind it on an angle on the carpet,
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:57.760]   the heat will actually turn it into a hypodermic needle
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:59.040]   if you know what you're doing.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.960]   - Hypodermic meaning like it smoothens the entry.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.960]   - It'll make a point and an angle
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:06.240]   that will guide its way into your flesh.
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.320]   So, you can actually go through a torso with that
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.360]   if you know what you're doing.
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.320]   - As a small tangent, you also gave me a present.
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.960]   (laughing)
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:17.720]   Could be one of the most epic presents I've ever received.
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:20.240]   You gave it to Rogan.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:22.000]   Can you explain what I'm holding in my hands?
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.280]   - There's a guy online, Coffin Tramp, is his moniker.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:30.840]   It is a G10 rod.
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:34.520]   G10 is a very strong material, basically.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.760]   A lot of people make actually G10 knives,
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.320]   which are basically non-magnetic, non-ferrous objects
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:41.720]   that can be utilized as a stabbing implement.
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.640]   The core of it isn't an actual pencil core.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:51.640]   It's a G10 core, and it's encased in oak, hard oak.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:55.280]   So that is capable, again, of stabbing through a torso.
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.120]   Now, the guy that made that is an artisan,
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.080]   you know, he makes that, it looks like a pencil.
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.960]   It's concealed in the nature of the object itself.
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:08.080]   But that small object is capable of being introduced
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.080]   into a chest cavity.
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:15.640]   You know, all it takes is about the half of your thumb
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.200]   or the length of your thumb to stab into your chest cavity,
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.600]   and now your pericardium is pierced,
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.440]   and it's being filled with blood,
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.880]   or your whole heart is pierced,
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:26.320]   and you have a few minutes to live
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.880]   if you're at a standing heart rate.
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:33.080]   - So this has the effectiveness of a knife, essentially.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:37.240]   - It has an effectiveness of a shank or an ice pick.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.960]   It's not gonna cut, but it's gonna make a hole
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:41.280]   where it shouldn't be.
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:44.320]   - Here, the pen is literally mightier than the sword.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:46.000]   - Yeah, well, it's...
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.480]   (laughing)
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:52.480]   This is really epic from a perspective of an academic.
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:57.880]   This is a symbol of both intelligence and violence.
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:58.720]   I love it.
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:00.240]   - And also the current state of affairs
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:02.160]   where people need to arm themselves
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:04.600]   with things that are concealed as far as their purpose
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:08.280]   in a place where, in a country or in a society
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:11.280]   that limits their ability to arm themselves.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.800]   So if you're going to a safe place,
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:16.040]   you're going to a place where no weapon's allowed,
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.160]   which means a target-rich environment if you're a predator.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:23.360]   That's a sign of rebellion.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:27.520]   - Let this be a signal of everyone should be terrified
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:28.600]   when you're around me.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:31.520]   'Cause even a pencil can murder you,
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:32.880]   and I intend to use this.
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.360]   - And nobody owns life,
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.880]   but anybody that can hold a frying pan owns death
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:39.480]   is a quote that I heard once, which is a beautiful one.
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:40.320]   - I'm looking at you.
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.900]   If anyone betrays me, this is the way to go.
[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:45.080]   Can you, given all your experience
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:46.040]   and all the different ways
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:48.340]   when you think about martial arts and violence,
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:53.320]   in Mexico, in the world, speaking of hoists,
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:59.400]   what is your approach to conflict, like a street fight?
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.920]   What advice would you give people in the full spectrum
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:06.680]   of what a street altercation might entail?
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:08.600]   What is the best way to approach it?
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:11.600]   - I think before you get there, you have to prepare.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:13.880]   This is one of the first things I tell people
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:18.440]   is if you don't have a basic TCCC training class behind you,
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:22.720]   you should reanalyze your life and your ability to prepare.
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:23.920]   - T-C-C-C.
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:26.040]   - Basically how to stop somebody from bleeding out
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:28.120]   or dying from a stab wound, gunshot wound,
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:29.880]   or any of those types of wounds,
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:32.240]   or an amputated leg during an IED scenario.
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:35.720]   Anything you would see in a Boston Marathon type event
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:37.800]   or a Vegas shooting event
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:39.840]   where people are getting shot, stabbed, cut.
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.360]   - So understand how to help people,
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.120]   how to help yourself post violence.
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.160]   - You don't wanna be a detriment to the situation.
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:49.600]   You wanna be an asset.
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:53.380]   So build yourself up as an asset in a situation like that,
[02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:54.960]   because you might be doing that on yourself
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:56.120]   or on somebody else.
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:58.320]   - And also it helps you understand
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:02.640]   what situations are going to result in a lot of,
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:05.480]   in a difficult situation to deal with afterwards.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:09.360]   - Yeah, it also teaches you what to stab and what to shoot.
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.640]   If you're thinking about it in a full,
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:14.000]   and on all the dimensions of it, you know.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.800]   You know, there's all knowledge can be weaponized.
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.120]   And I think that's the approach
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.240]   all people should kind of figure out for themselves
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:23.840]   when they start getting ready,
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.920]   or if they wanna take the responsibility
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:27.640]   of their own safety in their hands.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:29.080]   - So in a self-defense situation,
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:31.920]   there's a lot of questions here, but what does one stab?
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:34.960]   - There's the carotid arteries,
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.000]   which are used commonly in jujitsu as something to choke,
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.560]   because they feed a computer, you know.
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:42.960]   - So there's a lot of blood flowing through
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:46.000]   that requires for the successful operation of the computer.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.420]   - And not a lot of stuff is guarding the outside world
[02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:50.960]   from your carotid arteries.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:52.840]   - That's a really weird design, by the way.
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:54.920]   - It is not a smart one.
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:55.840]   - It doesn't even make sense,
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:57.720]   because with mammals, they bite each other's neck.
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:00.720]   Like, why can't you have more protection?
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:02.040]   'Cause this is the only, like,
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:04.940]   us humans don't use our mouth to kill each other,
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:07.520]   but most mammals, most predators do.
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.480]   It's like, why the hell don't we protect this?
[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:11.360]   - We do have a defensive mechanism,
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.880]   and you see it sometimes when people are ambushed
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:17.400]   and people try to open up each other's necks from behind.
[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:19.760]   If you push somebody's neck forward,
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:22.640]   the carotids will actually lower themselves
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:25.120]   and be encased in more flesh and muscle.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:28.160]   If you pull a head back, not so much.
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:31.480]   So that's a way that at least I think the evolutionary,
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:34.780]   we have a defensive mechanism for that.
[02:20:34.780 --> 02:20:35.960]   There's a few videos out there
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:39.200]   of people's getting their neck sewn back shut
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.920]   after somebody pushed their head forward
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:43.320]   to try and slice their necks, and they survived.
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:47.640]   So this is a viable target.
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:49.680]   The heart is another one.
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:51.600]   Interesting thing about the heart,
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:53.520]   and people get alarmed when I talk about this
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.160]   and show it in classes.
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:59.320]   Again, a lot of the classes I do are for orientation
[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:02.040]   and for people to recognize that behavior.
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.120]   So a lot of law enforcement comes to some of these classes
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:07.400]   and say, "Oh, that's horrible.
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:08.760]   "That's how somebody will kill somebody."
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:11.360]   Yeah, this is how people that know their shit
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:14.000]   will try and approach somebody and stab you to death.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.120]   This is how they would do it.
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:19.480]   There's a tendency to view what we see in John Wick
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:22.600]   or view what we see in this martial arts community
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:25.200]   where they're slicing and dicing people
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:27.560]   different myriads of ways.
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:30.340]   A lot of that is based on dueling-based cultures,
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:31.840]   like the Filipino martial arts
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:34.480]   or some of the Italian martial arts out there
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:36.480]   where somebody's facing off with somebody else
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:37.960]   with a similar weapon,
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.320]   and where both of us are agreeing
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:41.560]   to basically get into a stabbing competition.
[02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:45.720]   That would make sense in that scenario, in that context,
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:47.040]   but I've never seen a lot of people
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:50.220]   actually get into these one-on-one knife altercations.
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:53.000]   What we see now in a modern context
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.360]   when it talks about weaponry
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:58.360]   is an ambush, counter-ambush-based scenario
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:21:59.480]   where somebody pulls out a knife
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:01.880]   during a grappling situation on the street,
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.880]   or when somebody turns a striking exchange of punches
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:09.920]   into pulling out a cheap gas station knife,
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:14.920]   or a pen, or a rock from the ground, or a handgun.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:19.040]   Most modern combatants, when it comes to weaponry,
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:20.960]   should be kind of based on the whole aspect
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.200]   of ambush and counter-ambush.
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:25.240]   There's a lot of people showing valuable type of material
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:26.880]   and coursework on this out there.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:30.760]   My whole approach and my specific kind of realm
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:33.720]   is in the aspect of how people go from the process
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:36.640]   of learning some of these things from experiential stuff.
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:39.080]   People that grow up in rural places,
[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:40.560]   grow up on pig farms,
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:42.640]   that actually get the experience of processing a pig,
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:45.480]   for example, or processing an animal.
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:49.000]   Those people will have more skills, hunters,
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.880]   those people will have more skills with a knife
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:52.160]   if they pick it up as a weapon
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:55.080]   than most of the martial artists that I've seen
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.400]   kind of approach some of these classes
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:00.080]   where I go and have a simulated torso
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:02.960]   in the form of a pig hanging in a room somewhere.
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:07.280]   - Some of that has to do with just the familiarity
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.360]   and the comfort of just like the biology
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:10.360]   of a living organism.
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:12.360]   Like that if you cut off certain things,
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:15.720]   if you cut a certain thing, it's just a meat vehicle.
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:19.120]   - The same thing, the medical training should come first.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:20.960]   Or if you don't have that, be a hunter
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:23.280]   or go to a butchery class.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.840]   That will teach you more about how to use a knife
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:28.920]   on somebody else than anything.
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:31.600]   That'll give you the experience of flesh.
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:34.880]   Most people, I do this example every now and then
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:38.320]   where I have people bring in a tactical knife
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.960]   and they'll bring in a butter knife.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:42.280]   And I ask them which will go through a torso.
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.240]   We have a pig there,
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:46.000]   so it simulates a torso pretty closely.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.840]   Most people will say,
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:48.720]   "No, that butter knife is not gonna go through."
[02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.040]   And it does, it does go through.
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:52.920]   It's a thin enough, strong enough,
[02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:54.560]   sturdy enough that'll go through.
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:24:00.760]   Kitchen knife, a cheap one that cost 89 cents at a Walmart
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.520]   and an expensive $400 one.
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:07.520]   And the cheap one will outperform the expensive one.
[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:10.600]   The tip will snap off during some of it.
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:14.240]   - Yeah, I have to say that just as a small tangent,
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:19.240]   I went to a farm and just seeing the butchering of meat
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:25.320]   and so on, and the processing of meat and pigs and cows.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:28.520]   Ooh, that's uncomfortable.
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:29.360]   - Yeah.
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.280]   - But I think it also, it's honest and raw.
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.560]   And that's something that probably
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:35.480]   everyone should experience regularly.
[02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:40.200]   'Cause it's also humbling to remind you.
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:45.200]   Like when I had a dog, Homer, he's in Newfoundland,
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:49.840]   that I was very close with and we lost him.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:52.000]   And I just remember that I carried him.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.040]   He's like 200 something pounds.
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:56.480]   I had to carry him, I had to put him to sleep.
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.400]   And one of the biggest realizations is like,
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.000]   oh, this is just a biological thing.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:09.760]   To realize that this is just meat, this is not,
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:11.240]   and you can cut it.
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:13.000]   And then if you bleed,
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.960]   all of a sudden the life can disappear from you.
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:15.800]   - Yeah.
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:16.640]   - And it's all gone.
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:18.560]   It's like, holy shit, there's this meat vehicle
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:20.560]   that some people have referred to as Lex.
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:24.200]   I'm just a few stabbings away from--
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:25.040]   - Leaving.
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:26.240]   - Yeah, from leaving, goodbye.
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:28.160]   There's a soul that just flies away.
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:31.040]   - It used to be that we had to hang around,
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.200]   people would come back from battle
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:34.800]   and we would hear things next to the campfire.
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:36.760]   As far as, oh, he stabbed somebody here and this happens.
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:38.680]   But now we live in an age where you can,
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.760]   when I do a class, this is a stab to the heart.
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:46.520]   And here's like five videos of it happening live,
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:48.200]   on live leaks or whatever.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:49.440]   And we can deconstruct that.
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.680]   Not only that, but what weapon was used.
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:54.360]   Oh, it was a gas station folder.
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:57.360]   It was a pioneer woman knife from Walmart
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.120]   with flowers on the handle, whatever it was.
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:03.840]   And people start realizing that it doesn't take a lot.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:06.560]   That it doesn't take a lot of training
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.560]   because a lot of these people
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:10.320]   are not high level assassins trained
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:12.480]   by ninjas in the hills or anything like that.
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:14.280]   They're people that grew up rurally
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:16.880]   or learned by seeing that behavior in others.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:20.200]   And when they start coming to the realization
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:21.800]   that it's pretty easy to do that
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:22.920]   and they start figuring out like,
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:24.000]   how do you counteract that?
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.120]   Well, number one, learn the behavior yourself
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:27.080]   so you can recognize it.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.880]   The whole aspect of being a good counter ambush team
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:33.120]   is to be the best ambusher in the planet.
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.720]   So again, the whole aspect of Musashi saying,
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.640]   know your enemy, know his sword.
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.080]   You figure that out as far as learning that behavior.
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:45.080]   When you start seeing how some of these stabbings occur,
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:47.760]   the first thing you notice is that one of the hands
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:49.280]   is always kind of out of the picture
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.240]   or there's a lack of symmetry in the people
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:53.720]   that are about to do something horrible.
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:56.080]   So when you see lack of symmetry in the environment,
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:58.960]   somebody with their hands going backwards,
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:03.160]   there's a crowd of people and two or one individual
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:06.840]   is looking counter where everybody else is looking
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:10.640]   or there's a hyper aware individual in a crowd.
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.280]   The hyper aware are always usually out there
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:16.160]   to fuck somebody over
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.400]   or they're trying to keep those predators
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:19.840]   from fucking somebody else over.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:24.840]   So unless you step back and you put yourself in the process
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:26.480]   of learning how they learn
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:30.320]   and you become that potential nightmare person,
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.480]   it's hard to recognize that in a crowd.
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:36.880]   - It feels like one of the significant ways to win
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:39.160]   or as a street fighter is to avoid it
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:43.200]   by sort of sending pacifist signals in every way,
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.760]   meaning avoiding the situation
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:48.880]   whenever there's like a hyper vigilant people,
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:51.400]   you just kind of avoid signaling
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:55.240]   that you're one of the players of interest.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.840]   If we're talking about counter ambush,
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:01.520]   at which point do you do that versus shift to the aggression?
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.760]   - I think violence should be always an option.
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:07.240]   Everybody should have that option
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:09.200]   and you need to be good at that option.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:12.800]   I think I heard Jordan Peterson talk about the fact
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:14.020]   that everybody needs to be dangerous
[02:28:14.020 --> 02:28:15.680]   but keep that shit under control.
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:18.480]   - Yeah, I think he was referring to a different context.
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:19.800]   - I know, I know.
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.560]   (laughing)
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.400]   I'm referring to the ability of--
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:25.680]   - The little physical conflict as well.
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:27.200]   - There's two cases that I saw of people
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.120]   just utilizing social engineering to a beautiful degree
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:32.280]   to deescalate shit.
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:34.600]   One guy somewhere, first off,
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:36.080]   if you're in a place where people are grabbing
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:37.760]   your wife's ass or something like that,
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:39.040]   like what are you doing there?
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:41.920]   There's a load of things that are wrong
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:43.680]   with everything that you're doing in your life
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:45.240]   to be in that environment.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:48.740]   But let's say you're in an inescapable situation.
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:53.340]   There was this guy who was in a compromised position.
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:57.120]   Somebody wanted to fight him, like legit kick his ass.
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:00.640]   And he said, "Okay, let's go, but I just,
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:04.120]   I need to warn you that I have hep C before we go outside."
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:06.000]   And that--
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:06.920]   - It's masterful.
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:11.000]   - I was getting my phone out to film this, you know, maybe.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.440]   And even I was just lowered my phone to give him a slow clap.
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:16.360]   That was a beautiful move, you know?
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.040]   And then there was this other man.
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:25.040]   There was a riot somewhere in Ensenada,
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:27.080]   the municipality of Ensenada and Baja.
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:28.020]   They were protesting.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:31.240]   Some of the people that pick those fields down there,
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:33.840]   part of a tribe called Los Tricos.
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:37.920]   Very hardy, hardworking people, but nefarious people too.
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.460]   They're pretty good at their thing.
[02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:45.300]   There was a riot line they couldn't break.
[02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:47.620]   And this old man walks in the middle of the riot line
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:49.020]   and yells, "Grenade!"
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:52.100]   And throws an avocado in the middle of all the cops.
[02:29:52.100 --> 02:29:54.100]   And all, like, "Pfft!"
[02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:56.100]   He broke that riot line with an avocado.
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:59.860]   - That could have gone wrong in so many ways.
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:00.860]   - But it didn't.
[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:01.700]   I don't know.
[02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:03.860]   To me, like, there's small lessons there.
[02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:06.900]   There is a case to be made about social engineering,
[02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:10.060]   about learning about behavior, about learning how to lie
[02:30:10.060 --> 02:30:11.900]   and how to kind of move your way
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:14.820]   or navigate your way around situations like that.
[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:16.540]   Small things like bartering,
[02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.860]   knowing how to bribe people in conflict zones
[02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:21.300]   is the thing that I show when I talk about
[02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:24.580]   or train people to work in hostile environments.
[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:26.620]   De-escalation, you know,
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:28.500]   is specifically kind of figuring out
[02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:30.860]   what is of value in the environment,
[02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:32.980]   what things you shouldn't be doing in an environment
[02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:36.980]   that might be considered disrespectful or out of place.
[02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:38.340]   You know, people have a tendency
[02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:40.340]   that didn't grow up in places that are violent
[02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:43.740]   to make continuous eye contact with somebody
[02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:45.820]   that might be an issue.
[02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:48.220]   Or smiling when there's nothing to smile about.
[02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:50.900]   I think, you know, there's a picture I saw somewhere
[02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:54.940]   of Russians taking a portrait and there's Americans there
[02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:57.300]   and the Americans are smiling, but the Russians aren't.
[02:30:57.300 --> 02:30:59.020]   Because what is there to smile about?
[02:30:59.020 --> 02:30:59.940]   Which is true.
[02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:02.340]   - And of course, it's not as simple as smile or not smile.
[02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:04.020]   There's subtlety to it, like you said.
[02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:05.900]   Eye contact is a super interesting one
[02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:09.540]   'cause I found in my own life,
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:11.420]   like not making eye contact is,
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:13.500]   the people would be joking,
[02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:16.540]   but it's a really powerful way to de-escalate.
[02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:18.860]   And there's such a fascinating thing though,
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.260]   'cause you could talk about drunk fights
[02:31:21.260 --> 02:31:25.420]   that are just, that are harmless,
[02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:27.380]   but I feel like the same dynamic applies
[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:29.900]   to the most violent conflict, including wars.
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:33.220]   I feel like ego is part of this.
[02:31:33.220 --> 02:31:34.860]   So to me, the question of conflict,
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:37.420]   whether it's a street fight or anything else,
[02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:42.420]   is the calculus of, are you willing to take an L
[02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:45.620]   in terms of psychology?
[02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:48.020]   Somebody grabs your wife's ass, you mentioned.
[02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:52.620]   Boy, if you let that happen, you go home,
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:54.660]   you're gonna have to pay the price
[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:57.020]   of you were the person who didn't define you.
[02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:58.740]   Like in your relationship,
[02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:00.660]   you didn't defend your wife's honor.
[02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:04.980]   You're gonna psychologically pay that price yourself.
[02:32:04.980 --> 02:32:07.500]   And depending on your wife,
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:11.700]   she might secretly also lose a little bit of respect for you.
[02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.660]   Now, how do you play that calculus?
[02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:15.680]   'Cause now we see the war in Ukraine.
[02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:20.460]   I would say there is elements of similar posturing
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:25.460]   in the United States, in Europe, in Ukraine, Russia,
[02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:28.620]   China leadership. - At a macro level.
[02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:31.500]   - At a geopolitics, it's still somebody grabs
[02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:34.700]   somebody's ass and you're not backing down.
[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:37.860]   - So to take those losses and basically just posture,
[02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:40.180]   lower your head and live to fight another day
[02:32:40.180 --> 02:32:41.740]   type of situation.
[02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:46.140]   The thing with modern violence is the access to weaponry.
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:48.960]   I mean, again, nobody owns life,
[02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:50.940]   but anybody can hold a frying pan can own death.
[02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:55.020]   I've seen people get double-leg take down somebody
[02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:55.860]   on the ground.
[02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:59.060]   It's a different thing doing in the mats versus concrete.
[02:32:59.060 --> 02:33:01.380]   That's a good way to kill somebody.
[02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:04.340]   The most prolific impact weapon on the planet
[02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:06.500]   is the planet itself.
[02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:09.460]   You can see various videos of people online where they fall
[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:11.460]   and they hit their head or somebody hits their head
[02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:15.120]   and they go into the stretched out fit basically.
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:17.460]   And that might not kill you then,
[02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:19.820]   but it'll kill you that night or the second night
[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:20.980]   if you don't get checked out.
[02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:23.620]   People bleed out internally, get an edema.
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:25.420]   Again, the whole aspect of me showing
[02:33:25.420 --> 02:33:27.040]   how some of these things,
[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:28.940]   not only some of these methodologies
[02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:30.920]   and somehow people prepare for violence
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:33.420]   and how people experience violence,
[02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:34.460]   how they make their weapons,
[02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:37.180]   how the people fight in the streets and stuff like that.
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:39.780]   It's to recognize that behavior from the inception.
[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:43.780]   There's a video I show where there's a bunch of street kids
[02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:45.020]   in Rio de Janeiro.
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:48.180]   I think it's during the Olympics where they're snatching
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:50.780]   chains and cell phones from people.
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:52.460]   And it's a fun video, see it.
[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:57.700]   The first thing you learn about it is how they target people.
[02:33:57.700 --> 02:33:59.900]   Now, who are they going after?
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:01.440]   There's a bunch of people there.
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:04.320]   Why are they going after that specific person?
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.480]   And they start learning about profiling
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.000]   and how they identify victim mentality
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.480]   or the perfect victim, lack of awareness.
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:15.200]   They keep on a straight line, avoidance,
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:18.160]   avoidance of eye contact if they're doing something
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:20.720]   nefarious or wrong and how they pick
[02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:22.040]   who they're gonna go after.
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:27.040]   The small people, the women, even some of the men.
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.600]   And they separate the men that they're perfect victims
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.980]   versus the men that's gonna turn around
[02:34:30.980 --> 02:34:32.140]   and punch them in the face.
[02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:33.440]   What are they looking for?
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:37.340]   Well, first off, you notice that the men
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:40.320]   that are in that environment that look at them
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:42.740]   and are aware of their presence, the hyper aware,
[02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:44.980]   are the ones that are not good to target.
[02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:46.460]   So that's the first lesson there.
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:49.540]   So it's probably a good idea not only to be hyper aware,
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:52.140]   but to recognize that hyper awareness in others.
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:55.060]   If I wanna separate myself from the victim crowd.
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:56.820]   Another thing you notice is these are kids
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.340]   going after some grown adults.
[02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:01.220]   And some of these grown adult men are with women.
[02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:07.140]   And you see them kind of getting outside of the grasp
[02:35:07.140 --> 02:35:09.600]   of these kids that are trying to rip their chains
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.800]   off their neck or their cell phones.
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:14.700]   And they have no consideration for the women around them.
[02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:16.500]   You see other men that are with women
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:19.860]   and you see them grab the women and put them behind them.
[02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:21.940]   And immediately they'll say, "This is the wrong one.
[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:24.340]   "Let me move off to the next one."
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:28.180]   So that small little lesson in those videos
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:31.540]   will show you first how these kids are growing up
[02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:34.940]   to profile and target who the perfect victims are.
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:37.020]   That's a school for them.
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:39.020]   And that is an adversarial school.
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:42.540]   We should look at that school and apply it to ourselves.
[02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:45.060]   - So in general, you think conflict,
[02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:47.380]   ultimately the people that are doing conflict,
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:49.860]   they're looking for weakness?
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:51.980]   - I mean, they're looking for opportunity.
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:54.420]   You know, opportunistic, that's the predators.
[02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:55.260]   That's what they do.
[02:35:55.260 --> 02:35:57.100]   They look for an opportunity, you know,
[02:35:57.100 --> 02:35:58.300]   from jumping down from a tree
[02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:00.540]   and getting the slowest gazelle
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:03.340]   to looking for the opportune moment
[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:05.180]   to pounce on something that's probably big,
[02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:06.700]   but the risk is worth it.
[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:09.260]   - I feel like there's several motivations,
[02:36:09.260 --> 02:36:14.260]   but isn't there also a power hierarchy motivation as well?
[02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:17.760]   Like you, there's something about the big guy
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:20.180]   that tempts you to send a message,
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:21.100]   especially with gangs.
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:25.100]   Aren't they constantly sort of trying to signal
[02:36:25.100 --> 02:36:26.200]   that they're the alpha?
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:28.420]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a different situation.
[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:31.500]   You could be facing a sociopathic predator
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:33.500]   who is looking for something in you
[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:36.740]   that you are the resource that they're looking after.
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:38.580]   Maybe it's a woman, you know.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:41.060]   It could be a group of people that don't like the fact
[02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:44.340]   that you have a specific nationality
[02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:46.460]   or your passport is stamped in a specific way
[02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:49.000]   or that you pray to whatever God.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.780]   All these factor in,
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:54.340]   but in the end, they all do the same thing.
[02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:56.620]   They look for an advantageous position.
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:57.940]   If I were to target you,
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:02.020]   I would put you in between that wall and me.
[02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:05.180]   So you have two avenues of exits
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:07.320]   and I would step on one of your feet
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:08.660]   to keep that avenue closed.
[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:09.660]   So you have to go this way.
[02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:11.620]   So this is where my knife is gonna be.
[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:15.900]   You see that behavior mirrored everywhere in the world.
[02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:18.200]   First off, you look for advantages, right?
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:19.740]   If it's something that's unavoidable,
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:22.260]   like you're in between me and my ability to go home
[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:25.580]   or you're in between me and my ability to feed my family
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:28.020]   or you're in between me and my ability to posture
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:29.340]   to the people that are behind me,
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:31.860]   the young guys that I'm in charge,
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:35.780]   I will do everything in my power to end you, right?
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:41.300]   The motivations are not in my realm,
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:44.820]   but the ways they do it are, you know,
[02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:47.500]   and basically the advantage part of it.
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:51.980]   - So desperation is dangerous.
[02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:53.100]   - It's a dangerous school.
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:54.020]   When I say dangerous school,
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:55.700]   I mean the most dangerous people
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:59.300]   usually come from those desperate environments.
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:02.340]   You know, you can have people in Coronado
[02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:04.040]   holding onto logs in the ocean
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:06.620]   and go through this millions of dollars worth of training
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:10.900]   and just be professional killers for the government
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:13.860]   and just be these incredible human beings.
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:17.220]   And then there's a kid that will walk up to one of them
[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:18.780]   when he's off, you know,
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:20.940]   and put an ice pick right into his chest
[02:38:20.940 --> 02:38:22.780]   when he's least expecting it.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:25.380]   And that doesn't mean that one is superior than the other.
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:26.900]   It just means that there are more,
[02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:30.100]   that there's more than one way to become that, you know.
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:32.180]   - Teenagers terrify me.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:34.980]   It feels like the intensity of desperation,
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:41.720]   like the capacity of a teenager, like 16, 17,
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:46.780]   to be desperate and also not have the matured understanding
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.460]   of ethics of the world.
[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:51.020]   Like they have this intensity of feeling
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:53.860]   that is unlike anything else.
[02:38:53.860 --> 02:38:55.540]   - They don't have a volume knob to that.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:58.180]   So it's like a garden hose without a nozzle on it
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:38:59.060]   so you can regulate it.
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:00.320]   They haven't developed that.
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.140]   They haven't learned that maybe from somebody else.
[02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:04.900]   Or it used to be warrior cultures,
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:06.980]   you would be an apprentice under somebody
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:09.020]   or you would learn some of these things from other people.
[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:12.740]   Even some gang, modern gangs have a little bit of that.
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:14.420]   But if you're not and you're just this kid
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:17.620]   that's been playing Call of Duty all of his life
[02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:20.980]   or has been witnessing violence in media
[02:39:20.980 --> 02:39:24.620]   and there's no sense of,
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:26.340]   it's probably a bad idea to go off and do this
[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:27.900]   because of all these repercussions.
[02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:31.060]   I could see how that could be a danger to society.
[02:39:31.060 --> 02:39:33.420]   And some of the volume knobs,
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:36.300]   some of the countermeasures to people
[02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:41.300]   exploding on somebody else with a weapon, you know.
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:43.140]   You see videos constantly online.
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:47.300]   I remember seeing this one of these two teenage girls
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.900]   somewhere in the US and one of them just,
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:53.300]   there's a fight, there's a hair pulling competition
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:55.900]   and all of a sudden one of them takes out a knife.
[02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:57.900]   And it just happens like that.
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:02.900]   And it's just pure unrestrained downward stabbing.
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:07.020]   Now, you're like, wait, where's that come from?
[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:10.820]   Well, she's from an environment
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:13.900]   where she saw that as an option.
[02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:15.540]   She didn't see the repercussions of it.
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:17.500]   And she found herself in a place
[02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:20.500]   where she thought that was the only viable option,
[02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:21.540]   pulling out a weapon.
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:25.860]   And I think that's the dangerous part of it.
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:29.460]   - So how do you prepare to win those kinds of situations,
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:31.300]   to escape those kinds of situations?
[02:40:31.300 --> 02:40:36.060]   Like you said, it's training, it's exposing your mind.
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:36.900]   - I always tell people,
[02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:38.420]   like if you don't have a combative base,
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:42.380]   you don't have a base, boxing, jujitsu.
[02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:43.380]   - And that gives you what,
[02:40:43.380 --> 02:40:44.900]   like an awareness of your body kind of thing?
[02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:46.740]   - It gives you an awareness of your body,
[02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:48.180]   give you a spatial awareness.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:52.620]   If you can't see the points with your peripheral vision,
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:54.620]   if you can't see the points of somebody's feet
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:56.180]   in your peripheral vision,
[02:40:56.180 --> 02:40:58.820]   they are in range to stab you in the heart
[02:40:58.820 --> 02:40:59.740]   if they wanted to.
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:02.220]   And that's something you learn from boxing,
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:03.300]   that you learn from jujitsu,
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:04.740]   you learn from a bunch of combat arts
[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:08.500]   where you learn about distance and angling people.
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:10.940]   That comes from this experience that you have.
[02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:14.460]   You know, again, a lot of these things were just horseplay
[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:16.460]   when we were growing up in some cultures
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:19.620]   or rough and tumble with your brothers and shit like that.
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:22.780]   But some of us are growing up in single kid homes now
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:24.740]   and we don't get that, we were missing that.
[02:41:24.740 --> 02:41:25.660]   And if you don't have it,
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:29.060]   then you find it in the jujitsu gym,
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:30.300]   you find it in the boxing gym,
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:32.300]   you find it in a Thai boxing gym,
[02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:34.620]   you find it in places where they specialize
[02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:37.700]   in focusing on certain aspects
[02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:40.540]   of this whole combative whole, right?
[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:42.460]   It used to be before UFC,
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:44.620]   you know, the Kung Fu man,
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:48.540]   you know, Kung Fu guy, that's just street lethal shit.
[02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:50.340]   You can't use it in the sporting,
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:52.500]   you can't show you this because it'll kill you.
[02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:55.180]   Now we pretty much know that most of that was,
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:57.060]   you know, flights of fans here, BS.
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:58.300]   You know, it pains me too, man.
[02:41:58.300 --> 02:42:00.020]   I wanted to learn some of the D-Mock,
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:01.660]   the single punching and killing technique.
[02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:02.940]   You know, I remember those books,
[02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:04.060]   but that's just not-
[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:05.740]   - I'm still on the lookout for that.
[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:07.180]   - Maybe somewhere, I don't know.
[02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:08.620]   You know, maybe if you put a pen in your hand,
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:09.860]   that might turn into that,
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:12.740]   but that's the only way, right?
[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:16.580]   But a lot of these myths are kind of like faded away.
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:20.060]   Now you see people that have different combative bases,
[02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:21.860]   combining them all and becoming a fighter.
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:25.060]   Now, that's, UFC fight,
[02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:27.340]   two people fighting each other is one thing.
[02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:30.820]   You know, you being in the middle of the Portland riots
[02:42:30.820 --> 02:42:34.820]   and a bunch of state troopers throwing gas at rioters
[02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:37.060]   and then rioters themselves fighting each other
[02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:38.700]   and you finding yourself in the middle of that,
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:40.940]   that's a completely different thing.
[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:42.620]   And if you think you're gonna, you know,
[02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:44.660]   go on the ground and get in a guard
[02:42:44.660 --> 02:42:49.660]   with a guy swinging around a piece of a shovel handle,
[02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:52.100]   right, as tear gas is going on,
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:55.540]   because you got stopped there and your car was,
[02:42:55.540 --> 02:42:57.140]   you know, windows were broken
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:42:59.260]   and your family's in the backseat,
[02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:02.020]   you know, that is a different situation.
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:04.820]   So, you know, get medical,
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:09.220]   learning about weaponry, you know.
[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:14.180]   I personally don't really like fighting on the ground,
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:16.580]   but that's why I forced myself to go to train
[02:43:16.580 --> 02:43:18.820]   with different people out there, you know,
[02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:20.860]   on the ground, you get to catch wrestling.
[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:23.660]   - So top and bottom, neither, you don't like either.
[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:25.740]   - I personally, I like being in a car
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:27.220]   and running everybody over, that would be great,
[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:29.660]   you know, if I could, or driving really far away.
[02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:34.500]   Or I had this experience in Utah,
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:37.300]   some friends of mine, military,
[02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:39.900]   some of your best shooters,
[02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:41.180]   some of the best shooters in the US,
[02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:43.660]   you know, coming from the Marine Corps,
[02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:46.940]   were showing me how they, you know,
[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:49.540]   would shoot something from really far away.
[02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:52.900]   And I was like, oh, you don't even have to be
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:55.060]   in the same vicinity.
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:57.700]   The scope of violence, how far you can be from it
[02:43:57.700 --> 02:43:59.260]   or how close you could be from it.
[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:01.940]   - Just wait till we get to see what we can do
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:03.780]   in the cyber attack world.
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:05.900]   We can destroy your whole wellbeing,
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:08.460]   your whole life, your identity.
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:09.940]   - That's another aspect of it too.
[02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:14.340]   - Financial, and then figure out where you live,
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:15.940]   in terms of ambush.
[02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:16.780]   - Yeah.
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:18.220]   - Figuring out everything about you
[02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:21.220]   such that hurting you is easy.
[02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:23.620]   - I have a class where we specifically work
[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:27.380]   on social engineering and kind of how you can go
[02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:29.940]   about something that, you know, at a micro level.
[02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:33.580]   I do a class with a guy named Matt Fidler,
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:37.820]   who does a, basically he's one of the premier experts
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:41.860]   on how to get into and bypass locks, basically.
[02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:45.740]   He'll show you how to open up every single,
[02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:47.900]   or bypass every single commercial lock available
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:48.980]   in the United States.
[02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:51.740]   Like he'll spread it out and open up everything.
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:54.220]   And that's like, right?
[02:44:54.220 --> 02:44:56.580]   And my part in his class is I talk about
[02:44:56.580 --> 02:44:59.900]   how you can pull some of that off in a public space
[02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:02.300]   and not get caught, or how you would employ
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:04.820]   some of these things in a context where it's useful
[02:45:04.820 --> 02:45:08.380]   for law enforcement, for the military, stuff like that.
[02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:11.900]   And so we have this exercise in a public space
[02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:14.820]   where there's a bunch of padlocks in the environment, right?
[02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:19.620]   And we paint them pink so people know it's our padlocks
[02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:21.620]   and we're not breaking into anybody else's padlocks
[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:24.100]   if we get approached and asked about it.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:25.580]   But I asked the students like,
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:28.500]   so you have to gather all these padlocks
[02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:30.340]   from this public space, you know?
[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:31.300]   So how would you do it?
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:33.100]   So a lot of them are trying to pick them, you know?
[02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:35.300]   They're like very suspiciously picking them
[02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:36.660]   and stuff like that, that you get caught.
[02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:39.380]   And it's a whole situation.
[02:45:39.380 --> 02:45:41.700]   But the smart ones will basically develop
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:45.040]   a social media campaign related to the padlocks, right?
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:48.700]   A beautiful example of this.
[02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:50.980]   And this actually happened here in Texas.
[02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:53.420]   I did a class out in Dallas.
[02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:56.020]   We put the padlocks all over this public mall
[02:45:56.020 --> 02:45:58.140]   and the students basically came up
[02:45:58.140 --> 02:46:01.260]   with a breast cancer awareness campaign online
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:05.540]   that they made fake, well, they made flyers for it.
[02:46:05.540 --> 02:46:08.620]   They did the social media page on a campaign.
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:09.980]   They did this email chain.
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:12.980]   So when they went there, people were expecting them.
[02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:15.500]   So they normalized the behavior through social media
[02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:17.500]   and they were walking around with bowl cutters
[02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:20.460]   in the middle of a mall, cutting these things off.
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:23.500]   That's a beautiful, that's a beautiful solution
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:25.140]   to a complex problem of that nature.
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:29.140]   And again, the weaponizing part of it.
[02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:31.220]   Anything could be, all knowledge could be weaponized.
[02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:33.820]   And it's, if you focus on getting in a street fight
[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:35.780]   with somebody with your fist or a knife, you know,
[02:46:35.780 --> 02:46:38.140]   you're missing out on the whole complexity of violence
[02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:41.300]   and the way that it's now being utilized.
[02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:43.500]   - So in terms of breaking out locks
[02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:47.900]   and the restraints and captivity,
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:49.660]   let's talk about a dark topic
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:52.700]   that you're one of the world experts in, kidnapping.
[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:54.900]   So you teach courses on counter kidnapping
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:56.340]   and terrorism.
[02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:59.300]   I read an estimate that criminal gangs
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:03.100]   get $500 million a year in ransom payments from kidnapping.
[02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:05.780]   So just at a high level, what is kidnapping?
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:07.340]   Who does it and why?
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:11.540]   What are some insights that can help us understand
[02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:13.580]   what is this problem in the world?
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:14.740]   - It happens in different ways
[02:47:14.740 --> 02:47:15.740]   in different parts of the world.
[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:18.900]   I mean, I just sent off a group of people
[02:47:18.900 --> 02:47:21.300]   that trained some of the Ukrainians
[02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:23.620]   and some of the stuff that they were showing them
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:26.180]   was some of the counter custody stuff that I showed them.
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:29.020]   A friend of mine named Vince went out there
[02:47:29.020 --> 02:47:30.380]   was showing them some of the aspects
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:33.420]   of how to utilize things like Kevlar cordage
[02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:35.100]   and how to infuse it in their uniform.
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:38.380]   So if they get a zip tie to cut them open,
[02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:39.220]   it's a war setting.
[02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:43.580]   So it's talks about being captive in a war zone,
[02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:45.780]   but the information or the methodology
[02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:47.260]   actually comes from Mexico.
[02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:49.620]   That methodology, as far as how I learned it.
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:51.620]   - In terms of how to escape from restraints and stuff like that.
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:54.900]   So in Mexico, you have abductions happening
[02:47:54.900 --> 02:47:59.900]   where cartels who hold control over a specific place or zone
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:05.020]   are having a hard time with financial situations
[02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:07.540]   as far as maybe they're not making enough money
[02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:08.580]   to pay everybody off.
[02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:10.580]   So they let them freelance basically.
[02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:13.420]   And a lot of ways, some of these criminal groups freelance
[02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:15.340]   or some of these groups actually professionalize
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:19.100]   and to abduct businessmen, abduct the sons of businessmen
[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:23.380]   or people that have money to ask for ransoms for them,
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:24.700]   basically.
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:29.540]   And they've taken captivity and abduction
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:31.820]   to like an art form in places like Mexico.
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:33.300]   And it has a history all over the world,
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:35.820]   but specifically my experience with it
[02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:38.980]   was going to cartel safe houses
[02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:41.940]   that turned into holding places.
[02:48:41.940 --> 02:48:45.500]   You would see homemade prison cells and stuff like that.
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:47.700]   And people being held in captivity for months,
[02:48:47.700 --> 02:48:50.740]   if not years, as they were milking their family
[02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:51.900]   for everything they owned.
[02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:53.380]   - So it turns out into a business,
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:56.540]   they're not actually even interested in hurting the people.
[02:48:56.540 --> 02:49:00.700]   Physically, they're interested in hurting them financially.
[02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:02.940]   - Financially and also if they get hurt,
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:04.060]   they're hurt for a purpose,
[02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:06.820]   which is to make their family pay up faster or more.
[02:49:06.820 --> 02:49:10.140]   Some of the abduction groups that I've seen out there,
[02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:11.260]   professional ones in Mexico,
[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:13.780]   basically make it a living to target people
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:16.540]   that have abduction insurance or that work for a company
[02:49:16.540 --> 02:49:17.900]   that have good abduction insurance.
[02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:20.260]   So it's almost like an ATM for them.
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:22.140]   It's like, "Ah, here again, ah."
[02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:24.300]   So there's some of that going on.
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.900]   Some not so much.
[02:49:25.900 --> 02:49:27.580]   Some abductions are express.
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:30.500]   I mean, I'll grab you with a gunpoint,
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:32.820]   take you to an ATM, you empty it out,
[02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:33.780]   and then you're on your way.
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:35.060]   That's an express kidnapping.
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:38.500]   That might not be worth you doing anything insane.
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:39.940]   You just go with the motions.
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:42.780]   But some people do get picked up.
[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:47.740]   I have trained people with prior experiences
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:50.580]   of abductions in Mexico and here in the United States,
[02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:52.460]   people that have spent some time in captivity
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:55.940]   with loved ones here, like ex-boyfriends or boyfriends
[02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:59.020]   that tie them up and beat the shit out of them.
[02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:02.660]   And the restraints they utilize are zip ties and handcuffs,
[02:50:02.660 --> 02:50:05.260]   sometimes, or duct tape, or their own clothing,
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:06.740]   things of this nature.
[02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:08.180]   Basically what somebody's looking for
[02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:10.620]   when they tie anybody up is to convince you
[02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:13.460]   that they are in control, that they are God,
[02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:16.180]   and that any hope of you releasing those restraints
[02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:18.980]   or getting out of that situation is hopeless.
[02:50:18.980 --> 02:50:20.940]   From a cartel group picking you up
[02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:24.260]   in the middle of a dirt road somewhere in Cancun
[02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:27.660]   to ex-boyfriend showing up at your house
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:30.380]   and tying you up until you agree to get back with him.
[02:50:30.380 --> 02:50:31.460]   That's the same thing.
[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:35.380]   And some of the restraints that are being utilized
[02:50:35.380 --> 02:50:36.500]   come from different places.
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:39.700]   I mean, I remember an instructor I had way back when
[02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:42.820]   told me that the proliferation of zip ties
[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:44.820]   or restraint and criminal abductions
[02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:47.180]   came up after the movie "Heat" came out
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:48.980]   because everybody wanted to be Robert De Niro
[02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:51.140]   zip tying people in the bank robbery
[02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:52.900]   at the end of the movie.
[02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:55.540]   Criminals saw that and it became a thing.
[02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:56.380]   - It's hilarious.
[02:50:56.380 --> 02:50:58.260]   Can you actually speak to the,
[02:50:58.260 --> 02:50:59.900]   is it possible to systematically learn
[02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:03.500]   how to escape restraints, like handcuffs, rope, zip ties?
[02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:05.180]   - The best at it are not the military,
[02:51:05.180 --> 02:51:07.700]   the Nazi or program people, they are criminals.
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:10.340]   I learned how to get out of handcuffs from a 15-year-old
[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:12.300]   who was in charge of meth sales
[02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:15.340]   in La Avenida Revolución in Tijuana.
[02:51:15.340 --> 02:51:16.540]   - Is there a system to it?
[02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:18.340]   - I mean, it's not specifically a system.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:22.540]   It's usually what happens is they'll buy a set of handcuffs
[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:25.180]   and they will mess around with them in a playing feature.
[02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:28.300]   So one thing I do in a class is first off,
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:30.620]   I'm honest about the fact that some,
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:33.520]   all the restraints are temporary, even marriage.
[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:38.140]   - Wait, can we just pause in the deep philosophical?
[02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:41.180]   You're like Miyamoto Musashi with that statement.
[02:51:41.180 --> 02:51:43.920]   - All restraints are temporary, even marriage.
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:47.380]   I just like adding that one in there for last
[02:51:47.380 --> 02:51:48.620]   because this is a dark subject.
[02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:50.300]   - Every cage can be escaped.
[02:51:50.300 --> 02:51:51.540]   - All restraints are temporary.
[02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:54.500]   You either free yourselves from the restraints,
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:55.820]   somebody else takes them off,
[02:51:55.820 --> 02:51:58.540]   or you die and your body rots away around them.
[02:51:58.540 --> 02:51:59.640]   Those are the options.
[02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:02.940]   And I like that first option myself.
[02:52:02.940 --> 02:52:04.180]   The second option is pretty cool
[02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:06.300]   if you can convince somebody to do that for you.
[02:52:06.300 --> 02:52:09.020]   But that first option is an interesting one.
[02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:10.660]   You have to deconstruct restraints.
[02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:12.820]   Not all restraints are made the same.
[02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:15.360]   You can train to get out of handcuffs here in the US
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:18.060]   and focus on a pair of Smith and Wesson handcuffs,
[02:52:18.060 --> 02:52:21.060]   which are kind of the most common brand of handcuffs here.
[02:52:21.060 --> 02:52:24.200]   But if you find yourself in detention somewhere in Russia,
[02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:25.940]   the handcuffs out there are completely different.
[02:52:25.940 --> 02:52:27.220]   You know, the key way is different.
[02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:28.360]   The mechanism is different,
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:32.180]   but some of the same ways of bypassing those mechanisms are.
[02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:33.020]   - Let me write this down.
[02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:35.380]   So in Russia, what kind are they using in Russia?
[02:52:35.380 --> 02:52:37.660]   I think they're traveling there and need this information.
[02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:38.980]   - I'll send you a specific model
[02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:41.420]   and details on how to get out of those.
[02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:42.540]   But basically- - Just asking for a friend.
[02:52:42.540 --> 02:52:43.380]   I'm sorry.
[02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:45.940]   - So what I do is I take a pair
[02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:47.120]   of Smith and Wesson handcuffs.
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:50.380]   I put them in the middle of three people in a class.
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:53.860]   I spread them out and I have them place them on each other
[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:55.260]   in a just playing manner.
[02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:57.220]   I have handcuffs keys there,
[02:52:57.220 --> 02:52:59.020]   and I have a pair of bolt cutters there
[02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:01.540]   in case somebody gets stuck, does something stupid.
[02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:03.020]   So they play with each other
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:04.500]   as far as putting them on randomly.
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:06.620]   I show them how to put them on appropriately.
[02:53:06.620 --> 02:53:09.300]   And then I show them a handcuff key
[02:53:09.300 --> 02:53:11.940]   and a handcuff key will open up handcuffs,
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:13.840]   interestingly enough.
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:16.380]   But the thing about a handcuff key is it's not made
[02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:19.540]   to be used by the person that is in those handcuffs.
[02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:21.600]   So that's the first lesson there.
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:22.860]   If you have a handcuff key,
[02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:25.440]   handcuff keys are the most used tool
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:28.800]   to open up handcuffs in custody situations.
[02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:31.780]   You know, both criminals escaping from the police
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:34.460]   to people escaping from criminals.
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:36.740]   Just the standard hidden handcuff key.
[02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:38.820]   So I show them how to modify the handcuff key
[02:53:38.820 --> 02:53:40.700]   so it's more optimal to use on yourself
[02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:43.020]   with just basic garbage that you can find.
[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:45.300]   Piece of wire, a zip tie piece,
[02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:48.820]   basically how to put a leverage arm on the handcuff key
[02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:50.820]   so you can actually spin it in the key way,
[02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:53.100]   behind your back or in front of you.
[02:53:53.100 --> 02:53:56.700]   - Trying to think, I don't think I've ever been in handcuffs.
[02:53:56.700 --> 02:53:58.940]   - Appropriate way to handcuff somebody is palms out.
[02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:01.260]   - How much restriction is there in terms of-
[02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:02.080]   - There's a lot.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:04.960]   It's a hinge handcuffs, there's a lot of restriction.
[02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:05.920]   With no chain in the middle.
[02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:06.980]   - Can you reach back?
[02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:08.320]   - You could try and reach back,
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.260]   or you can basically put yourself
[02:54:10.260 --> 02:54:12.400]   in a not compromised position
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:16.140]   and feed the most of your palm meat into the handcuff way
[02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:18.680]   so when they shut it on you,
[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:21.240]   you have more space to work with.
[02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:22.720]   So you can spin your hand.
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:24.740]   We call it a passive resistance.
[02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:27.660]   Again, you go through a process with them
[02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:31.100]   where you deconstruct how people are handcuffed,
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:33.000]   handcuff keys and how to modify a handcuff key
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:34.320]   to be able to use on yourself.
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:37.420]   And all of these things they're constructing as we go.
[02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:40.120]   So they basically, "Hey, what's a grinding surface?"
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:41.280]   Well, there's concrete outside.
[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:42.920]   So they grind an angle on the key
[02:54:42.920 --> 02:54:46.800]   so you can get a key not to go straight into the key way,
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:49.200]   but you can get it into the key way at an angle,
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:50.040]   for example.
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:53.580]   It's something that is out there as far as a method.
[02:54:53.580 --> 02:54:55.640]   You can't spin a key behind your back because it's small.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:57.620]   It's designed to be used by somebody else
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:54:58.900]   opening those handcuffs on you.
[02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:01.440]   So you put an arm on it so you can leverage our arm
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:03.240]   so you can spin it behind your back.
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:07.200]   You learn how to put yourself
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.600]   in not a compromised position.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:11.280]   If somebody asks you for your hands
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:14.280]   so they could be cuffed, you don't do this.
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:17.120]   You do that or you put yourself in a cable grip
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:19.220]   behind your back, which is a pretty strong grip
[02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:21.160]   and it's hard to spread those hands apart.
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:24.040]   It's also something that people go into automatically
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:25.640]   when they're in fear.
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:28.360]   So all of these things are advantageous for you.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:32.380]   And you learn how not only people get restrained,
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:33.420]   but you see videos of them
[02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:34.820]   because I show a bunch of abduction
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:36.380]   that's actually happening live.
[02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:39.700]   Again, the best thing is avoidance,
[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:42.020]   but specifically when you work around restraints
[02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:45.740]   is number one, learn how some of these restraints work.
[02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:49.940]   Number two is learning how some of the ready-made tools
[02:55:49.940 --> 02:55:53.540]   to get out of those restraints look like function.
[02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:55.420]   And number three, which is the advanced level
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:57.940]   is learn how to construct all of these things yourself,
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:01.140]   which is, I think that is the best thing
[02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:02.840]   you can show somebody.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:05.000]   For handcuffs, I just use a standard pair of handcuffs
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.860]   and then we deconstruct other very specialized handcuffs
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:09.140]   that might be out there.
[02:56:09.140 --> 02:56:11.420]   And you show them, if you're gonna travel somewhere,
[02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:13.700]   learn what restraints are commonly available
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:14.940]   in the environment.
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:17.100]   Somebody going to a sub-Saharan Africa
[02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:19.740]   carrying a plastic handcuff key,
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:22.380]   that's gonna be useless out there
[02:56:22.380 --> 02:56:25.060]   because there's not gonna be standard handcuffs out there
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:28.660]   that would be open with that type of key.
[02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:30.380]   Out there, you're probably gonna be tied up
[02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:32.380]   with a chain and a padlock of some sort,
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:34.460]   maybe a 40 millimeter Chinese padlock
[02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:37.860]   with a plastic core that you can open with a lighter
[02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:39.900]   if you can burn the core, melt the core open.
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:42.300]   Or if you can leverage that open,
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:43.700]   that's a pretty easy thing to open.
[02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:45.820]   Or a bobby pin, you could reach all the way in the back
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:47.180]   and open the latch.
[02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:48.080]   - What about rope?
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:50.100]   Is that common?
[02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:51.420]   - Yeah, it is common.
[02:56:51.420 --> 02:56:53.980]   This is one of my favorite things for rope.
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:58.340]   Something I usually carry in some places.
[02:56:58.340 --> 02:57:00.700]   It's another gift for you if you want.
[02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:02.340]   It's a ceramic razor blade.
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:03.340]   - Nice.
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:04.800]   - Is it capable of cutting?
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:07.580]   - Nice.
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:10.540]   - Small, you can put it behind a label.
[02:57:10.540 --> 02:57:13.060]   I've seen some students put the Levi's label on there
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:14.860]   and just sew it back on.
[02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:18.540]   It is non-magnetic, non-ferrous.
[02:57:18.540 --> 02:57:22.100]   So in and out of that type of situation,
[02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:22.940]   you can get in it.
[02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:26.180]   And it's something you can have with you everywhere.
[02:57:26.180 --> 02:57:27.420]   This is a pretty fancy one.
[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:29.460]   Or you can just grab a simple razor blade.
[02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:30.980]   And actually learning how to use
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:34.420]   or leverage a razor blade between your palms
[02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:37.500]   and know how to go up and down with it
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:38.340]   to be able to cut yourself out of rope.
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:41.340]   - And of course, so that's just practice to do that well.
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:44.220]   - It's practice and it's also exposure to just,
[02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:45.380]   this is a possibility.
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:46.460]   This is how you could hide it.
[02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:49.820]   Again, the whole smuggling aspect comes from a criminal,
[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.700]   a criminal mindset type setting.
[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:54.580]   So how things are hidden, where they're hidden.
[02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:57.140]   And when I talk about concealing objects of this nature,
[02:57:57.140 --> 02:58:00.140]   it usually comes from smuggling.
[02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:02.020]   The fact that I have something in a notebook
[02:58:02.020 --> 02:58:03.500]   comes from heroin smuggling.
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:07.300]   If you're not looking at the school of criminality,
[02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:10.680]   you're missing out on a big part of the equation.
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:14.940]   - So for people who wanna learn about this,
[02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:16.500]   do you teach courses on this?
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:20.340]   Do you know what's the, how do you get in touch with you
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:21.220]   or learn from you?
[02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:23.140]   Do you have stuff online or is it only in person?
[02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:25.780]   - So I have some stuff on my Patreon specifically.
[02:58:25.780 --> 02:58:29.460]   I have a Patreon where I share a lot of the online material.
[02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:32.380]   I basically a bunch of, this is my notebook.
[02:58:32.380 --> 02:58:34.580]   I have a bunch of stuff that I,
[02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:37.020]   I just met somebody in Philadelphia that showed me
[02:58:37.020 --> 02:58:40.820]   a pretty unique way of utilizing a box cutter as a weapon.
[02:58:40.820 --> 02:58:43.960]   So I wrote some of that down, I filmed some of it.
[02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:46.580]   And it's not for any other reason.
[02:58:46.580 --> 02:58:48.780]   I'm not trying to create dangerous people out there.
[02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:49.900]   It's like, hey, look at this.
[02:58:49.900 --> 02:58:52.260]   This is something that's out there, right?
[02:58:52.260 --> 02:58:53.340]   So a lot of that information,
[02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:54.660]   some of those notes and stuff like that,
[02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:56.420]   I keep on my Patreon.
[02:58:56.420 --> 02:58:58.620]   I used to share it openly on Facebook and Instagram,
[02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:03.620]   but that has not been possible anymore.
[02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:05.660]   - Well, I'm a member of your Patreon
[02:59:05.660 --> 02:59:06.820]   and I recommend people sign up.
[02:59:06.820 --> 02:59:09.180]   It's really great 'cause you also have philosophy.
[02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:14.180]   You're the Mexican Miyamoto Musashi.
[02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:17.300]   It's not just the skills,
[02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:18.940]   it's also the philosophy around it.
[02:59:18.940 --> 02:59:21.020]   Like I got that book of five rings
[02:59:21.020 --> 02:59:22.300]   before I went into training.
[02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:24.620]   Like I took that with me through training.
[02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:26.020]   The whole aspect of, you know,
[02:59:26.020 --> 02:59:28.860]   go to places frightening to the common brand of men,
[02:59:28.860 --> 02:59:30.220]   you know, be put in jail
[02:59:30.220 --> 02:59:32.580]   and extricate yourself with your own wisdom.
[02:59:32.580 --> 02:59:35.420]   I think he was speaking about experience,
[02:59:35.420 --> 02:59:36.700]   you know, the whole warrior's journey,
[02:59:36.700 --> 02:59:39.660]   the hero's journey of going out there and actually risking.
[02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:44.340]   I think that's a pretty big basis and aspect
[02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:47.300]   of what the work I do and showing some of these things.
[02:59:47.300 --> 02:59:48.660]   There's a tendency to people that say,
[02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:51.140]   "Hey, I'm afraid to go to Mexico.
[02:59:51.140 --> 02:59:52.100]   "What do I need to know?"
[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:53.940]   Like, well, if you're afraid to go to Mexico,
[02:59:53.940 --> 02:59:55.540]   go to Mexico.
[02:59:55.540 --> 02:59:56.500]   I mean, I was in Detroit.
[02:59:56.500 --> 02:59:58.220]   I was pretty afraid when I was in Detroit
[02:59:58.220 --> 03:00:01.100]   and some parts of Detroit and the South Side of Chicago.
[03:00:01.100 --> 03:00:05.820]   But I don't wanna be dictated where I can go
[03:00:05.820 --> 03:00:07.660]   and where I can't go because of safety.
[03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:09.660]   I wanna take responsibility for that myself
[03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.500]   and figure out ways of being more capable
[03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:14.660]   and an asset to the people around me and myself.
[03:00:14.660 --> 03:00:16.340]   And that comes from experience.
[03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:19.860]   And people don't wanna risk getting a shoulder injury
[03:00:19.860 --> 03:00:21.380]   rolling in jujitsu or don't wanna risk
[03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:24.060]   getting a bloody nose in boxing, but that is the way.
[03:00:24.060 --> 03:00:28.100]   - Well, there's some aspect to fitting in.
[03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:31.660]   You quote Hattori Hanzo on imitation.
[03:00:31.660 --> 03:00:34.020]   "The most important thing you should keep in mind
[03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:36.540]   "when you go on a Shinobi mission
[03:00:36.540 --> 03:00:39.620]   "is to imitate well the language of the target province
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:41.580]   "and the ways of the local people.
[03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:43.300]   "This includes their appearances,
[03:00:43.300 --> 03:00:44.940]   "the way of wearing clothes,
[03:00:44.940 --> 03:00:46.780]   "the way of shaving their head,
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:49.020]   "the way of making up their hair,
[03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:51.220]   "the way of making up a sword or short sword,
[03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:54.260]   "and the way of refinement and luxury."
[03:00:54.260 --> 03:00:56.500]   So how do you fit into some of those places?
[03:00:56.500 --> 03:00:59.820]   So you know Mexico, but a person like me
[03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:00.980]   that doesn't know anything about Mexico,
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:02.900]   and say I'm interviewing somebody
[03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:05.820]   in a leadership position in a drug cartel.
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:08.180]   How quickly do you learn how to fit in?
[03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:09.420]   - I mean, it's not about fitting in,
[03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:11.740]   it's about coming up with a narrative for yourself.
[03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:12.820]   What that book is talking,
[03:01:12.820 --> 03:01:15.900]   that's a quote from the book called "A Shouninki,"
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:18.740]   which is like an actual legit ninja manual
[03:01:18.740 --> 03:01:21.700]   from like the 1500s or something like that.
[03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:25.860]   And they're not talking about blending in,
[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:28.900]   they're talking about creating a narrative or a lie
[03:01:28.900 --> 03:01:30.460]   to your appearance and your behavior
[03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:31.460]   and your knowledge base.
[03:01:31.460 --> 03:01:32.560]   That's what they're talking about.
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:34.540]   So I would say first,
[03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:36.460]   if you're gonna go to a place like that,
[03:01:36.460 --> 03:01:38.420]   first off, learn what is common there,
[03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:40.620]   what type of common restraints might be placed on you,
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:42.700]   what criminal groups work out there,
[03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:44.760]   what type of guns they have.
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.060]   Not only what type of guns they have,
[03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:47.380]   but go to the gun range in Vegas
[03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:49.200]   and learn how to fire some of these firearms yourself
[03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:50.260]   so you know how to load them
[03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:52.580]   in case you run into a bad situation.
[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:53.980]   How they tie the sword,
[03:01:53.980 --> 03:01:56.540]   how they wear their short swords
[03:01:56.540 --> 03:01:58.740]   could equate to how, you know,
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:00.300]   if you run into some issues.
[03:02:00.300 --> 03:02:01.940]   Also, it would give you a good idea
[03:02:01.940 --> 03:02:03.580]   how many rounds those hold
[03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:05.460]   so you can run at the right moment.
[03:02:05.460 --> 03:02:08.740]   - I like how you focus in on the tools of violence.
[03:02:08.740 --> 03:02:12.020]   But there's also the social engineering de-escalation, right?
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:14.300]   - Yeah, so if you are in an environment like that
[03:02:14.300 --> 03:02:16.880]   and you are carrying around a camera,
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:18.040]   that might be an issue.
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:19.960]   - Or the opposite, it might not be an issue.
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:21.360]   - Well, if you're asked, like,
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:23.760]   were you with, I'm with a news organization,
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:26.000]   or am I with a Christian aid group here?
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:27.200]   - Yeah.
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:28.720]   - And if you are with a Christian aid group,
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:30.880]   it's probably a good idea to learn some of the Bible, right?
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:34.200]   If you want a quick way of having somebody out there
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:35.720]   try and stop talking to you,
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:37.440]   you can start talking about Jesus
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:39.720]   in the middle of a little cartel territory
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:41.680]   when they approach you and take out the Bible.
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:43.320]   That'll quickly de-escalate.
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:45.820]   - What I usually prefer to do is I find somebody
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:47.900]   from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal
[03:02:47.900 --> 03:02:49.820]   and beat them up in front of the,
[03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:51.620]   just to send a signal that I'm not a journalist,
[03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:53.300]   and I too don't like journalists.
[03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:55.700]   - That could be a way, but--
[03:02:55.700 --> 03:02:56.620]   - To send a message.
[03:02:56.620 --> 03:02:58.100]   - I think a lot of us miss the fact
[03:02:58.100 --> 03:03:00.920]   that we are capable of taking control of our own narrative
[03:03:00.920 --> 03:03:03.140]   and what we communicate to people around us.
[03:03:03.140 --> 03:03:06.700]   I could show up here drinking a Monster Energy drink,
[03:03:06.700 --> 03:03:09.220]   dumping it on the ground, scratching you know what,
[03:03:09.220 --> 03:03:11.700]   and just sit down and just be a rude motherfucker.
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:14.200]   That's not who I am, but I can do that.
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:16.960]   And you will believe me if I am good at it.
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:19.720]   Some of us miss the, some of us don't know this aspect
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:21.560]   because it's something we consider predatory
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:25.000]   or something that is wrong or negative or bad.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.800]   And some of these aspects are actually,
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:28.440]   you know, they're pretty useful.
[03:03:28.440 --> 03:03:31.840]   I learned most of my tradecraft and skill craft
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:34.560]   from panhandlers and street performers.
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:38.240]   And when I had some training related to social engineering,
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:40.560]   those were the people that I learned from.
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:43.500]   I remember we were doing surveillance
[03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:45.080]   and there was a guy there that showed us
[03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:47.340]   how to do surveillance, you know, on the street.
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:49.340]   And he said, "If you can find a way
[03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:52.580]   "for somebody to smell you before they see you,
[03:03:52.580 --> 03:03:54.420]   "you'll become invisible."
[03:03:54.420 --> 03:03:56.720]   And I was like, "That's bullshit.
[03:03:56.720 --> 03:03:58.960]   "If you can find a way of somebody smelling you
[03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:00.500]   "before they see you become invisible."
[03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:03.020]   I didn't understand what that meant.
[03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:05.700]   So we went on a three-day bender, didn't take a shower,
[03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:08.220]   smelled like shit, no deodorant.
[03:04:08.220 --> 03:04:09.700]   You know, you smell like a homeless person,
[03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:11.140]   you look like a homeless person,
[03:04:11.140 --> 03:04:12.960]   and you approach somebody asking for the time
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:15.020]   and they smell you before they see you.
[03:04:15.020 --> 03:04:18.280]   And you are not there, you're not a human, you don't exist.
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:21.620]   So that was a pretty valuable lesson that I got there.
[03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:23.260]   - Yeah, so that's interesting.
[03:04:23.260 --> 03:04:25.880]   But like, I have this belief,
[03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:28.500]   it has to do with the way I operate in this world,
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:32.860]   I suppose, but if you come off as a person legitimately,
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:36.820]   I guess you could fake it, but I think it just feels like
[03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:41.820]   you can be extremely good, possibly the best in the world,
[03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:45.840]   if you practice it your whole life, at being you.
[03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:51.180]   At showing like you have nothing to hide.
[03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:54.380]   - A true believer, a true believer.
[03:04:54.380 --> 03:04:56.600]   - So like, yes, you can come up with a fake narrative,
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:04:58.300]   but then what I mean is like,
[03:04:58.300 --> 03:05:00.400]   live that narrative your whole life then.
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:05.860]   And then never falter from that.
[03:05:05.860 --> 03:05:08.740]   Like you are this person, that's what I'm trying to,
[03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:10.500]   I have nothing to hide.
[03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:11.980]   - I consider that a true believer,
[03:05:11.980 --> 03:05:15.140]   and yeah, that is a unique person when you meet them,
[03:05:15.140 --> 03:05:16.300]   and they are out there.
[03:05:16.300 --> 03:05:19.620]   There are people that will fucking walk into places.
[03:05:19.620 --> 03:05:21.980]   This is who I am, I don't give a fuck.
[03:05:21.980 --> 03:05:23.300]   This is who I am, if you don't trust me,
[03:05:23.300 --> 03:05:24.760]   well, shoot me, fuck it.
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:27.620]   This is my honesty, and if you don't trust me,
[03:05:27.620 --> 03:05:28.580]   well, look at all these people
[03:05:28.580 --> 03:05:30.260]   that I've interacted with in the past,
[03:05:30.260 --> 03:05:31.340]   and you can ask them about it,
[03:05:31.340 --> 03:05:33.820]   or you can see my effects on other people.
[03:05:33.820 --> 03:05:35.300]   That's gonna be my presentation card.
[03:05:35.300 --> 03:05:37.860]   - And so the way you said it now is using words,
[03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:39.040]   and it's blunt.
[03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:40.980]   Usually if somebody is blunt like that,
[03:05:40.980 --> 03:05:43.580]   like I'm a no bullshit person, that means they're not.
[03:05:43.580 --> 03:05:44.900]   That means they're a full of shit, actually.
[03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:46.900]   - But you do that through, I mean, I'm saying,
[03:05:46.900 --> 03:05:50.500]   I'm verbalizing your behavior, just walking somewhere.
[03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:53.840]   Let's say you're going to interview
[03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:56.060]   somebody very dangerous down there,
[03:05:56.060 --> 03:05:58.200]   and you walk into a room without worry.
[03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:03.020]   That is a presentation to you.
[03:06:03.020 --> 03:06:05.560]   - That's a pretty interesting introduction.
[03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:08.220]   You're not a threat
[03:06:08.220 --> 03:06:10.860]   because you don't consider yourself a threat,
[03:06:10.860 --> 03:06:12.340]   and you're walking in there with the confidence
[03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:14.820]   that you don't consider yourself a threat,
[03:06:14.820 --> 03:06:17.420]   which is an interesting way of going about it.
[03:06:17.420 --> 03:06:19.980]   My life experiences has been different.
[03:06:19.980 --> 03:06:22.420]   I wasn't programmed that way from an early age,
[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:26.040]   and it's hard for me to go into that line,
[03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:29.220]   although more and more as I get older,
[03:06:29.220 --> 03:06:30.860]   and as I learn more about the world,
[03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:32.580]   and I've failed a few more times,
[03:06:32.580 --> 03:06:35.660]   I can understand or more cognizant of the fact
[03:06:35.660 --> 03:06:39.420]   that you don't really have to try that much
[03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:43.820]   if you believe in yourself and who you are.
[03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:47.180]   If you know yourself, I think that is at the core of it.
[03:06:47.180 --> 03:06:50.540]   If you know yourself enough to be able
[03:06:50.540 --> 03:06:53.980]   to kind of communicate that to people around you.
[03:06:53.980 --> 03:06:55.700]   - And you're not hiding from yourself
[03:06:55.700 --> 03:06:58.620]   or from the world your flaws, too.
[03:06:58.620 --> 03:07:01.220]   That was the other thing you spoke to
[03:07:01.220 --> 03:07:02.980]   that is probably inspiring to others
[03:07:02.980 --> 03:07:05.140]   is being honest about your flaws,
[03:07:05.140 --> 03:07:06.900]   about your weaknesses as a human being.
[03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:08.540]   - You can't pickpocket a naked man.
[03:07:08.540 --> 03:07:09.380]   - Yeah, that's right.
[03:07:09.380 --> 03:07:10.220]   That's really brilliant.
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:14.200]   - If you know how to be naked, and again, I'm not there.
[03:07:14.200 --> 03:07:16.500]   I think I'm working towards that
[03:07:16.500 --> 03:07:19.460]   just by hopefully going through shit
[03:07:19.460 --> 03:07:22.380]   and showing people, not telling them.
[03:07:22.380 --> 03:07:23.580]   Is it show me, don't tell me
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:26.700]   is another valuable lesson that I got long ago.
[03:07:26.700 --> 03:07:29.780]   I travel across the country,
[03:07:29.780 --> 03:07:32.700]   and I not only get to show people what I know how to do,
[03:07:32.700 --> 03:07:36.940]   but I give examples of it through things that I do out there.
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:41.060]   And I say this a lot, when I travel out there,
[03:07:41.060 --> 03:07:42.140]   I'm never alone.
[03:07:42.140 --> 03:07:44.060]   There's couches out there waiting for me.
[03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:47.580]   There's homes that I can go and stay at,
[03:07:47.580 --> 03:07:49.620]   and friends that I have out there
[03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:51.700]   that I have never even met.
[03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:54.900]   But that's been about me not only wearing
[03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:57.780]   some of those mistakes and past failures on my sleeve,
[03:07:57.780 --> 03:08:00.660]   but also turning them into lessons for people.
[03:08:00.660 --> 03:08:03.140]   And just telling people the fact that,
[03:08:03.140 --> 03:08:05.860]   I know how to do all this weird stuff,
[03:08:05.860 --> 03:08:07.980]   and I show people how to do it.
[03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:09.340]   But here's a bunch of weird memes
[03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:11.460]   that are very humorous about my culture
[03:08:11.460 --> 03:08:14.380]   and about going through therapy.
[03:08:14.380 --> 03:08:17.620]   And this is me doing something goofy.
[03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:18.900]   And this is me being an idiot
[03:08:18.900 --> 03:08:20.580]   in front of all you guys as well.
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:21.660]   This is me being the fool.
[03:08:21.660 --> 03:08:23.900]   I think that is another aspect of it.
[03:08:23.900 --> 03:08:25.380]   - I love that as part of that journey,
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:26.940]   you made enemies with the rodeo clown
[03:08:26.940 --> 03:08:28.420]   and meet up with him afterwards.
[03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:32.340]   - Oh, we're still, we're in a very toxic relationship.
[03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:33.340]   He knows who he is.
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:34.660]   He's probably out there listening.
[03:08:34.660 --> 03:08:35.980]   He's a-- - Love and hate.
[03:08:35.980 --> 03:08:37.020]   - We-- - All there.
[03:08:37.020 --> 03:08:39.140]   - We stopped talking to each other for months
[03:08:39.140 --> 03:08:41.940]   and then just send a dick message of some sort
[03:08:41.940 --> 03:08:43.780]   and just, we're back at it.
[03:08:43.780 --> 03:08:45.060]   - Back, yeah.
[03:08:45.060 --> 03:08:47.140]   Love expressed through anger, I love it.
[03:08:47.140 --> 03:08:48.700]   It's therapeutic.
[03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:51.380]   You have both very interesting career paths.
[03:08:51.380 --> 03:08:54.620]   If we can just jump back to a really interesting topic
[03:08:54.620 --> 03:08:58.700]   that I wanted to mention on narco-cultism.
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:01.020]   What are narco-cults?
[03:09:01.020 --> 03:09:02.580]   What's the relationship between,
[03:09:02.580 --> 03:09:04.380]   you kind of mentioned religion a little bit.
[03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:05.780]   - Yeah. - What's the relationship
[03:09:05.780 --> 03:09:09.340]   between religious culture and drug culture?
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:11.220]   - First off, Mexico is one of the most Catholic countries
[03:09:11.220 --> 03:09:14.060]   on the planet, if not the most Catholic country
[03:09:14.060 --> 03:09:15.020]   on the planet.
[03:09:15.020 --> 03:09:18.740]   Not only that, it is a country that has a root
[03:09:18.740 --> 03:09:23.740]   in a spirituality through its ethnic culture
[03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:28.900]   that other parts of the world got most of that taken away
[03:09:28.900 --> 03:09:32.080]   and/or suppressed or killed or taken away.
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:36.020]   When the Spanish came to Mexico,
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:41.020]   they were a product of a recently liberated group of people.
[03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:46.500]   They just got done being invaded by the Moors, basically.
[03:09:46.500 --> 03:09:48.060]   And they brought with them the image
[03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:51.860]   of La Virgen de Guadalupe, the Virgin of Guadalupe.
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:54.140]   And Hernan Cortes' vision of that,
[03:09:54.140 --> 03:09:57.000]   or version of that was a lady holding a crystal scepter,
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:01.740]   baby Jesus, and standing on a crescent moon.
[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:04.780]   That's what he brought with him to the Americas.
[03:10:04.780 --> 03:10:09.340]   And when the conquest happened, a lot of people say,
[03:10:09.340 --> 03:10:13.380]   "Yeah, the Spanish came and conquested the Aztec empire.
[03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:16.380]   "The enemies of the Aztec allied themselves
[03:10:16.380 --> 03:10:18.160]   "with the Spanish and they took them down."
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:19.000]   That's what happened.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.980]   And then the rest was famine and sickness.
[03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:25.300]   That's what killed most of them.
[03:10:25.300 --> 03:10:27.580]   They realized that it was gonna be hard
[03:10:27.580 --> 03:10:29.980]   to suppress some of the spiritual practices in Mexico,
[03:10:29.980 --> 03:10:33.740]   so they decided to meld them with Catholic iconography.
[03:10:33.740 --> 03:10:38.620]   So you see this cult to Tuanatzin,
[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:41.300]   which is like a fertility variant
[03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:44.660]   of a mother goddess in Aztec culture.
[03:10:44.660 --> 03:10:47.220]   And they turned her into La Virgen de Guadalupe,
[03:10:47.220 --> 03:10:49.740]   which is the icon that a lot of Mexicans venerate
[03:10:49.740 --> 03:10:51.560]   as the La Virgen, the virgin.
[03:10:51.560 --> 03:10:57.980]   But in her, she conceals cultural elements from the past.
[03:10:57.980 --> 03:10:59.760]   She has a black sash across her stomach,
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:01.100]   which means she's pregnant,
[03:11:01.100 --> 03:11:03.420]   something common in the Aztec culture,
[03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:05.180]   in the Mexica culture.
[03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:08.140]   She's standing on a cherub that has eagle wings,
[03:11:08.140 --> 03:11:09.700]   that is a war god.
[03:11:09.700 --> 03:11:12.060]   That's the symbol of the war god down there.
[03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:16.060]   She has stars on her, which is a veil of certain stars
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:17.780]   that are related to some of the spiritual practice
[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:18.620]   from before.
[03:11:18.620 --> 03:11:25.060]   Basically, they hid these things in that setting.
[03:11:25.060 --> 03:11:29.460]   Now you skip forward hundreds of years,
[03:11:29.460 --> 03:11:33.460]   and you start seeing things like Malverde,
[03:11:33.460 --> 03:11:36.920]   who was a bandit that lived in Sinaloa way back in the day.
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:38.940]   He would rob rich farmers
[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:42.140]   that would go through the countryside.
[03:11:42.140 --> 03:11:45.060]   One time he was almost caught, and he was shot and injured,
[03:11:45.060 --> 03:11:46.580]   and he was wanted by the government.
[03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:51.140]   So he told one of his friends to tell them where he was
[03:11:51.140 --> 03:11:55.160]   and to give the reward money to the townspeople.
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:56.000]   So he did that.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:59.180]   He was hung from a tree,
[03:11:59.180 --> 03:12:01.540]   and the order was not to bury him,
[03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:03.260]   just to let his body rot.
[03:12:03.260 --> 03:12:04.780]   And his body rotted away
[03:12:04.780 --> 03:12:07.460]   until it fell onto the ground, the bones.
[03:12:07.460 --> 03:12:09.980]   And each of the townspeople would go over
[03:12:09.980 --> 03:12:12.340]   and put a rock on top of his corpse
[03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:14.800]   until it became a pile of rocks.
[03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:17.000]   And then he started granting miracles.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:20.640]   So again, this whole aspect of these criminals
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:21.680]   become in saints.
[03:12:21.680 --> 03:12:27.060]   And also a middle finger from the downward local populace
[03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:28.860]   to the church in a way,
[03:12:28.860 --> 03:12:30.500]   because he's not a recognized saint,
[03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:33.720]   but he has an altar and people venerate that.
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:38.740]   Then you have cartels that have a spiritual practice
[03:12:38.740 --> 03:12:40.960]   or spirituality behind what they do,
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:42.340]   which is part of their culture,
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:44.700]   but it's also like a tool they use
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:48.680]   to ingratiate themselves with the local populace
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:51.300]   or the population around them.
[03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:53.340]   They're icons of power,
[03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:58.020]   and sometimes of almost a symbol of rebellion.
[03:12:58.020 --> 03:13:02.140]   You see El Chapo's son, when he was arrested,
[03:13:02.140 --> 03:13:05.420]   had a Santo Niño de Atocha on his chest,
[03:13:05.420 --> 03:13:09.220]   which is a holy kid of Atocha.
[03:13:09.220 --> 03:13:12.300]   Spanish legend during the Moorish conquest,
[03:13:12.300 --> 03:13:14.740]   they said that a statue of that saint
[03:13:14.740 --> 03:13:17.540]   would go around and feed some of the hungry.
[03:13:17.540 --> 03:13:19.380]   That was the legend.
[03:13:19.380 --> 03:13:22.020]   And he's a saint of the persecuted.
[03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:24.900]   So the fact that when he was arrested,
[03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:27.660]   you see him wearing that,
[03:13:27.660 --> 03:13:31.260]   and then he was liberated is a miracle in and of itself.
[03:13:31.260 --> 03:13:34.660]   So it's proof that that works.
[03:13:34.660 --> 03:13:38.620]   You see, you can find one of those scapuladios
[03:13:38.620 --> 03:13:39.460]   anywhere in Mexico.
[03:13:39.460 --> 03:13:41.600]   It was the most, at least the sold one.
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:46.980]   So you see them utilizing some of these aspects
[03:13:46.980 --> 03:13:50.380]   in their own belief system as a symbol
[03:13:50.380 --> 03:13:52.180]   or as iconography, basically,
[03:13:52.180 --> 03:13:54.020]   for some of the things they do.
[03:13:54.020 --> 03:13:56.380]   Then you go into some of the other aspects of it
[03:13:56.380 --> 03:13:58.020]   that are out there, like Santa Muerte,
[03:13:58.020 --> 03:14:00.220]   which is actually a faith that I grew up in.
[03:14:00.220 --> 03:14:03.800]   Mexico has a weird relationship to death.
[03:14:03.800 --> 03:14:06.740]   We have parties at the cemetery on Day of the Dead,
[03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:08.940]   and I just went through one recently.
[03:14:08.940 --> 03:14:11.280]   This is November the 2nd.
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:15.060]   So we celebrate our dead,
[03:14:15.060 --> 03:14:16.540]   and we celebrate death in a way
[03:14:16.540 --> 03:14:19.220]   that I don't think a lot of cultures out there do.
[03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:20.700]   - So it's a joyful occasion.
[03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:21.940]   - It is a celebration, yeah.
[03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:24.920]   My eight-year-old put two beers on an altar,
[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:27.020]   one for my mom, one for my brother.
[03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:29.500]   She bought a Snickers bar for my mom
[03:14:29.500 --> 03:14:33.980]   and a bag of pops for my brother,
[03:14:33.980 --> 03:14:35.340]   flower petals and marigolds,
[03:14:35.340 --> 03:14:36.820]   and pictures of them on an altar.
[03:14:36.820 --> 03:14:37.940]   - That's amazing.
[03:14:37.940 --> 03:14:39.340]   What kind of beer?
[03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:40.180]   - Tecate.
[03:14:40.180 --> 03:14:43.060]   Tecate Roja for my mother, because she was hardcore,
[03:14:43.060 --> 03:14:45.140]   and Tecate Light for my brother.
[03:14:45.140 --> 03:14:47.120]   He was more of an endurance drinker.
[03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:50.100]   And it's also for me,
[03:14:50.100 --> 03:14:53.900]   the relationship to death down there is different.
[03:14:53.900 --> 03:14:55.500]   So there's an icon in Mexico.
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:58.180]   It's actually one of the fastest-growing
[03:14:58.180 --> 03:15:02.820]   alternative spiritual practices in Mexico.
[03:15:02.820 --> 03:15:04.620]   And not only in Mexico, but here in the US.
[03:15:04.940 --> 03:15:08.340]   I've been to Santa Muerte temples across the country.
[03:15:08.340 --> 03:15:11.080]   I found one in Connecticut, out of all places.
[03:15:11.080 --> 03:15:14.060]   How I grew up with it, where I saw it,
[03:15:14.060 --> 03:15:18.180]   is my family was all Guadalupanos.
[03:15:18.180 --> 03:15:20.980]   We were Catholic, and we venerated
[03:15:20.980 --> 03:15:23.300]   the Virgin of Guadalupe, specifically,
[03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:25.920]   the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:27.680]   But every now and then, there were winks and nods
[03:15:27.680 --> 03:15:31.520]   to a skeletal saint in family practices.
[03:15:31.520 --> 03:15:33.560]   And even when I went to work,
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:38.240]   the older guys that I was working with
[03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:43.160]   would tell me, "Hey, we gotta go ask for protection."
[03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:45.000]   So they would drive me over to the church,
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.080]   and I thought I was going to the cathedral.
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:50.240]   And then we made a left turn, and it wasn't the cathedral.
[03:15:50.240 --> 03:15:53.640]   It was the market next to the cathedral in Tijuana.
[03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:55.560]   And in the little corner,
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:16:00.360]   there was a big Santa Muerte reaper effigy.
[03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:03.960]   And then I knew why I had to bring a bottle of tequila.
[03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:05.760]   I was like, "Why am I bringing a bottle of tequila
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:06.640]   to the church?"
[03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:09.760]   It was for her, for death, la muerte.
[03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:14.440]   It was partly hazing, and also,
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:18.840]   they did believe that they were basically imbued
[03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:23.200]   with being agents of death, in a way.
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:24.960]   So it was like a cultural thing as well,
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:29.360]   something that they wore on them as not only protection,
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:32.480]   but as also like a samurai would wear
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:34.120]   this death iconography on them,
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:39.120]   or how the Maori would do haka dances
[03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:42.520]   to some of these guys in their kind of warrior culture
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:44.000]   that they were growing up with
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.760]   or trying to imbue on us, the young guys.
[03:16:46.760 --> 03:16:49.400]   They would take us there,
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:51.680]   and they would imbue us with iconography of Santa Muerte
[03:16:51.680 --> 03:16:53.800]   to be like a psychological thing.
[03:16:53.800 --> 03:16:55.480]   - So that gives you strength and meaning
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:16:57.160]   in the face of struggle,
[03:16:57.160 --> 03:16:59.840]   like in the face of difficulties in life?
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:02.040]   - I think, you know, your closeness to death
[03:17:02.040 --> 03:17:04.120]   and having a relationship to death
[03:17:04.120 --> 03:17:06.640]   in the form of a symbolic representation of it,
[03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:09.680]   like Santa Muerte or an icon like that,
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:12.120]   makes it not as scary, I guess.
[03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:14.600]   Or not only that, but it's also something
[03:17:14.600 --> 03:17:19.000]   that the other side, the enemy, the cartels groups,
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000]   they would venerate it as well.
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:22.360]   So when they would see it on you,
[03:17:22.360 --> 03:17:24.520]   it was almost debilitating to them.
[03:17:24.520 --> 03:17:26.280]   They were like, "Oh, are you guys cops?
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:28.880]   "Are you guys, why are you wearing that?"
[03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:31.760]   So there was an aspect of that to it.
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:35.520]   A momento muerte, muerte type thing,
[03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:38.400]   where you remember death, you know, type thing.
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:40.240]   - There's some aspect in which you don't wanna mess
[03:17:40.240 --> 03:17:42.760]   with a person who meditates on death.
[03:17:42.760 --> 03:17:44.320]   - There was some of that, yeah.
[03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:45.520]   (laughing)
[03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:48.080]   There was a saying, I think they probably took it
[03:17:48.080 --> 03:17:49.560]   from a movie or something like that,
[03:17:49.560 --> 03:17:51.920]   but I don't know where they got it.
[03:17:51.920 --> 03:17:55.000]   May I earn your need and be your wrath.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.680]   - Oh man, that's a good line.
[03:17:58.680 --> 03:18:01.920]   - They would say that to the statue of La Santa.
[03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:07.120]   Another thing people, it's not a cartel specific saint,
[03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:09.760]   though, it's like everybody, at all levels,
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:12.160]   from the lady that sells tortillas,
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:15.640]   to the cops, to the military.
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:17.800]   There's some people in the military that venerate it.
[03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:20.760]   There's a very specific symbol of how this is
[03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:24.040]   like a weird relationship, specifically in Santa Marta,
[03:18:24.040 --> 03:18:28.360]   in Mexico, there's a shrine outside of Tijuana,
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:32.720]   right across the La Presa, it's like a water reservoir,
[03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:34.400]   right outside Tijuana.
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:37.960]   And there was a big Santa Muerte altar there,
[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:39.240]   like on the roadside.
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:44.320]   And my former boss, Leza Ola, ordered that thing destroyed.
[03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:47.120]   So he ordered a truck to destroy it.
[03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:48.200]   It was a famous thing.
[03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:51.000]   And it was rebuilt the next night.
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:52.560]   And I know for a fact that some of the people
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:54.320]   that rebuilt that were some of the same guys
[03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:56.600]   that were there destroying it.
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:18:59.560]   - Oh man, that's pretty symbolic.
[03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:02.160]   So it's just, it's not something that can be killed.
[03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:05.320]   It's a part of the spirit of the people.
[03:19:05.320 --> 03:19:09.040]   - It keeps getting destroyed by ultra Christian groups
[03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:11.480]   or Catholic groups, and it keeps getting rebuilt.
[03:19:11.480 --> 03:19:16.320]   Personally, for me, as a, you know,
[03:19:16.320 --> 03:19:19.800]   I don't believe that there's a reaper skeleton
[03:19:19.800 --> 03:19:21.280]   in the sky protecting me.
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:26.440]   But I do believe in the aspect of an ending, you know,
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:28.120]   and how it's important to, you know,
[03:19:28.120 --> 03:19:29.600]   the ending is important in all things,
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:31.440]   and death should be present in life.
[03:19:31.440 --> 03:19:35.120]   And if it's not, then you're delusional about things.
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:37.520]   - So to you, it's a mechanism to meditate on death
[03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:38.520]   once again.
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:39.360]   - Yeah.
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:42.640]   And, you know, having my daughter, who's eight,
[03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:48.720]   view it as a benevolent thing, you know,
[03:19:48.720 --> 03:19:50.840]   she's a kid and she sees a skeleton
[03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:53.000]   that represents death and Jesus does.
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:20:00.040]   I think in a way, Mexicans have taken some of those aspects,
[03:20:00.040 --> 03:20:03.000]   be it day of the dead,
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:06.640]   some of these practices related to some occultism aspects
[03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:11.360]   around, you know, St. Judas, you know, San Judas.
[03:20:11.360 --> 03:20:15.440]   St. Judas is the patron saint of lost causes.
[03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:17.640]   And it's one of the most venerated saints in Mexico.
[03:20:17.640 --> 03:20:20.520]   You know, Jesus is probably the fourth or fifth
[03:20:20.520 --> 03:20:23.520]   you pray to, which is pretty funny, ridiculous.
[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:26.160]   But the reason why,
[03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:28.480]   and this is something I heard from somebody that was,
[03:20:28.480 --> 03:20:31.680]   actually, we found him with a gun,
[03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:35.520]   and on his gun, he had a St. Judas effigy.
[03:20:35.520 --> 03:20:40.200]   And he said, "Oh, like, why St. Judas?"
[03:20:40.200 --> 03:20:41.480]   "Porque San Judas?"
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:44.280]   And he's like, "Well, he's the last saint you pray to."
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:46.600]   "What do you mean?"
[03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:48.000]   "Well, on the list of saints you pray to,
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:50.320]   he's the last one, because when you pray to Judas,
[03:20:50.320 --> 03:20:52.800]   you might get the other Judas on the line."
[03:20:52.800 --> 03:20:53.640]   - Yeah.
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:54.480]   - That's the last one you pray to.
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:57.000]   That's why he's like the lost cause of saint.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.240]   How I remember, like,
[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:04.160]   even how we try and bribe or like maneuver our way,
[03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:06.720]   even in spirituality, it's spiritual practices.
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:07.560]   - Yeah.
[03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:08.400]   - You know?
[03:21:08.400 --> 03:21:10.160]   - Such a fascinating culture.
[03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:12.240]   That's unlike anything else.
[03:21:12.240 --> 03:21:13.600]   - And it's right next door.
[03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:15.800]   And it's here too.
[03:21:15.800 --> 03:21:19.720]   Again, I found an altar in Connecticut,
[03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:20.920]   which is pretty fascinating.
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:22.880]   There's one in Arizona.
[03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:26.360]   Again, it's one of the fastest growing spiritual practices
[03:21:26.360 --> 03:21:29.400]   in not only in the US, but across the,
[03:21:29.400 --> 03:21:32.840]   there's somebody from Russia reached out.
[03:21:32.840 --> 03:21:34.200]   There's an altar out there,
[03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:36.520]   and there's a group of people praying to Santa Marta.
[03:21:36.520 --> 03:21:39.280]   And I've been posting and writing a lot about it recently,
[03:21:39.280 --> 03:21:40.520]   just from my own experience
[03:21:40.520 --> 03:21:42.320]   and some of the stuff that I gathered for myself,
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:45.160]   and all the way out there.
[03:21:45.160 --> 03:21:47.600]   Those people are fascinated by some of those aspects.
[03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:49.440]   - So I gotta ask you about the dark turn
[03:21:49.440 --> 03:21:51.520]   of that spirituality,
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:52.920]   or maybe you'll place this elsewhere,
[03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:57.240]   but who was Adolfo Costanzo, El Padrino?
[03:21:57.240 --> 03:22:00.680]   - He's just a guy that comes up in a period,
[03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:04.720]   I think he's at that initial period of cartels.
[03:22:04.720 --> 03:22:05.880]   This is before my time,
[03:22:05.880 --> 03:22:08.120]   and I've talked to some of the people
[03:22:08.120 --> 03:22:09.920]   that were there for some of that.
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:11.840]   - I mean, he kills a lot of people.
[03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:16.200]   - He was exposed and learned through his family ties
[03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:18.880]   about some of the Afro-Caribbean spiritualities
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:21.000]   that are now also exploding,
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.640]   as far as influences across the world,
[03:22:23.640 --> 03:22:26.200]   Latin America and in the US.
[03:22:26.200 --> 03:22:30.960]   When I talk about that, I mean, Santeria, Palo Mayombe,
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:33.880]   basically some old spiritual practices
[03:22:33.880 --> 03:22:38.880]   coming out of Africa that utilize things like Ngangas,
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:42.520]   which are basically spiritual vessels
[03:22:42.520 --> 03:22:46.680]   that have to be loaded with human remains in some cases.
[03:22:46.680 --> 03:22:52.800]   He was basically a spiritual practitioner
[03:22:52.800 --> 03:22:54.640]   that certain cartel groups would hire
[03:22:54.640 --> 03:22:58.040]   for them to curse the other side,
[03:22:58.040 --> 03:23:00.360]   to imbue them with invisibility,
[03:23:00.360 --> 03:23:03.840]   to be able to transport their drugs or protection spells
[03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:04.840]   and stuff like that.
[03:23:04.840 --> 03:23:06.920]   He was very successful at it, apparently,
[03:23:06.920 --> 03:23:09.680]   or at least that is the experience of the people
[03:23:09.680 --> 03:23:11.520]   paying for some of these practices.
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:17.400]   As his spells and his work kept getting bigger and bigger
[03:23:17.400 --> 03:23:19.080]   and more and more complicated,
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:23.920]   the ingredients he needed for these Ngangas or these spells,
[03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:27.960]   these cauldrons that he would fill with certain elements,
[03:23:27.960 --> 03:23:30.320]   grew in complexity.
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:33.240]   Till finally he said he needed the brain
[03:23:33.240 --> 03:23:35.400]   of a highly educated American of some sort,
[03:23:35.400 --> 03:23:38.880]   which led to his eventual downfall.
[03:23:38.880 --> 03:23:41.560]   He was basically responsible for abducting
[03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:45.680]   and murdering a young American who was a university,
[03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:47.680]   college student, I think.
[03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:50.880]   - Do you think he believed the,
[03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:52.920]   so this guy's murdering people to create,
[03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:55.240]   what, magical potions?
[03:23:55.240 --> 03:23:56.080]   - Vessels, yeah.
[03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:56.920]   - Vessels?
[03:23:56.920 --> 03:24:02.240]   - Yeah, I think he truly believed that he was capable
[03:24:02.240 --> 03:24:04.040]   of doing what he was doing, I guess.
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:07.480]   - And there was a culture that's spiritually inclined
[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:11.960]   that kinda was on the same wavelength as him.
[03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:13.560]   - Yeah, it jived.
[03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:15.280]   I mean, some of these spiritual practices,
[03:24:15.280 --> 03:24:17.920]   again, there's a ritualistic cannibalism
[03:24:17.920 --> 03:24:19.840]   done by some of these cartel groups out there.
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:22.200]   - Was he involved in cannibalism as well?
[03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:24.240]   - He wasn't involved in cannibalism that I know of,
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:26.640]   but most of the things that he was kind of known for
[03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:29.560]   was basically requesting human body parts
[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:31.800]   for some of the spell works he was doing.
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:34.440]   And then going to such a level
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:37.680]   where he needed a specific brain or head of somebody
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:40.280]   that was educated and American.
[03:24:40.280 --> 03:24:44.480]   So that kinda, again, led to his eventual downfalls.
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:46.680]   His ranch was raided, they found the body parts
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:49.040]   inside of these cauldrons that he was preparing.
[03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:50.800]   That's an interesting example of somebody.
[03:24:50.800 --> 03:24:54.740]   There's a cartel head somewhere in Central Mexico as well.
[03:24:54.740 --> 03:24:57.880]   El Mas Loco was his nickname.
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:25:01.520]   And he basically forced the citizenship around him
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:02.920]   to turn him into a saint.
[03:25:03.820 --> 03:25:05.640]   So he made a statue of himself.
[03:25:05.640 --> 03:25:08.880]   He was very big into Christianity,
[03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:13.520]   specifically kind of like the crusader mentality
[03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:15.640]   and all of that, kind of imbued himself
[03:25:15.640 --> 03:25:18.440]   and some of the people that were around him with that.
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:21.880]   And there's still altars to his death, to him,
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:22.720]   after he died.
[03:25:22.720 --> 03:25:24.040]   He died two times.
[03:25:24.040 --> 03:25:26.520]   One time, the government declared him
[03:25:26.520 --> 03:25:27.520]   that he was killing to shoot out,
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:29.280]   and it turns out he wasn't dead.
[03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:30.920]   So that was his first miracle.
[03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:34.780]   And then when he was really dead,
[03:25:34.780 --> 03:25:36.980]   some of his people and his loyal followers
[03:25:36.980 --> 03:25:39.740]   were, by gunpoint, kinda still forced to go
[03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:42.300]   and give flowers and venerate these effigies
[03:25:42.300 --> 03:25:44.180]   and statues of him as a saint.
[03:25:44.180 --> 03:25:45.940]   It's a powerful weapon.
[03:25:45.940 --> 03:25:47.780]   Spirituality in Mexico is a powerful weapon.
[03:25:47.780 --> 03:25:51.100]   And the Catholic church in Mexico
[03:25:51.100 --> 03:25:52.620]   has a pretty bad track record,
[03:25:52.620 --> 03:25:57.620]   but as far as that being used to control populace
[03:25:57.620 --> 03:25:59.020]   and stuff like that.
[03:26:00.100 --> 03:26:03.280]   And I think it's just another aspect
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:05.320]   that is being exploited in Mexico,
[03:26:05.320 --> 03:26:07.440]   in some communities, as far as the spirituality
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:10.960]   and the desperate need for people to believe in something
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:12.840]   and how that leads for some people
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:15.880]   to go into some horrible predatory behavior around it.
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:19.200]   - There's a fascinating dynamic at play here.
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:21.160]   So it's not just the United States and Mexico,
[03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:23.800]   it's also China that you talk about.
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:26.680]   China is the primary source of fentanyl in the world.
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:31.680]   So fentanyl is an opioid that leads to 70,000
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:35.260]   plus or minus overdose deaths in the US every year.
[03:26:35.260 --> 03:26:38.320]   So reading from Wikipedia, quote,
[03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:41.020]   "Compared with heroin, it is more potent,
[03:26:41.020 --> 03:26:43.560]   "has higher profit margins,
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:46.560]   "and because it is compact, has simpler logistics.
[03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:49.320]   "It can be cut into or even replaced entirely
[03:26:49.320 --> 03:26:51.800]   "the supply of heroin and other opiates."
[03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:53.280]   What do you think is important to understand
[03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:54.940]   about fentanyl as a drug?
[03:26:54.940 --> 03:26:57.480]   - There was a prescription opioid epidemic
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:02.480]   in the United States that kind of went down or stopped,
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:04.400]   well, it's still out there,
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:09.400]   but the epidemic specific around it kind of petered out.
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:11.960]   And there was also marijuana legalization
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:16.280]   happening at kind of the same time period,
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:19.600]   which people talking about marijuana legalization
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:21.680]   thought it was gonna hit the cartels in their pockets
[03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:23.920]   and it was gonna be like a death blow
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:26.280]   to these criminal groups.
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:30.820]   Well, now there's illegal pot grows in the United States
[03:27:30.820 --> 03:27:33.820]   being run by cartels in federal lands.
[03:27:33.820 --> 03:27:36.640]   There's the legal pot grows that are in some way,
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:39.720]   shape or form influenced and are run or owned
[03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:40.960]   by some criminal groups,
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:43.120]   and they're kind of utilizing that.
[03:27:43.120 --> 03:27:45.280]   The marijuana fields in Mexico
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:48.600]   turned into poppy fields once again.
[03:27:48.600 --> 03:27:51.220]   The problem is that some of these lands
[03:27:51.220 --> 03:27:52.840]   were leached of all the nutrients
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:55.480]   and they're not as good as something
[03:27:55.480 --> 03:27:57.080]   you would find somewhere in Afghanistan.
[03:27:57.080 --> 03:27:59.600]   So the yield and the quality of it
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:02.440]   wasn't as strong as it could be.
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:04.480]   So somebody thought about the right idea
[03:28:04.480 --> 03:28:06.620]   of putting fentanyl into the mix.
[03:28:06.620 --> 03:28:11.600]   And not only that, but also figuring out
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:13.960]   how to get fentanyl into Mexico.
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:17.840]   Mexico has a giant pharmaceutical industry
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:19.840]   that people kind of also don't kind of know
[03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:21.720]   or factor into this equation,
[03:28:21.720 --> 03:28:26.640]   which leads into the free ability
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:29.480]   of chemicals going in and out of the country
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:32.440]   and legal means of it happening, right?
[03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:34.640]   So not only the precursors to make it,
[03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:37.320]   but also the chemist and the industry
[03:28:37.320 --> 03:28:40.120]   to create it in Mexico as well.
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:42.720]   Some clandestine factories of fentanyl
[03:28:42.720 --> 03:28:44.820]   have been found in Mexico,
[03:28:44.820 --> 03:28:46.480]   but realistically it's not needed
[03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:49.760]   with the ways that the ports and the borders
[03:28:49.760 --> 03:28:51.100]   are down in Mexico.
[03:28:52.100 --> 03:28:55.660]   You started seeing an influx and a flood
[03:28:55.660 --> 03:28:57.620]   of fentanyl into Mexico,
[03:28:57.620 --> 03:29:01.260]   specifically related to infusing it into heroin.
[03:29:01.260 --> 03:29:04.460]   And not only using that to feed local drug markets,
[03:29:04.460 --> 03:29:06.380]   but send it up into the United States,
[03:29:06.380 --> 03:29:07.860]   which started off this process
[03:29:07.860 --> 03:29:09.940]   that we're kind of going through still.
[03:29:09.940 --> 03:29:12.240]   - Are these like similar highs?
[03:29:12.240 --> 03:29:15.180]   And drug wise, why do you infuse?
[03:29:15.180 --> 03:29:16.660]   I mean, probably you're not the right person
[03:29:16.660 --> 03:29:19.180]   to have this biochemical discussion of how--
[03:29:19.180 --> 03:29:21.220]   - I don't know about the biochemical aspect of it,
[03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:24.460]   but like speaking to guys that do Chiba down there,
[03:29:24.460 --> 03:29:27.300]   that's what they call heroin down there.
[03:29:27.300 --> 03:29:29.340]   It's like a nickname for it.
[03:29:29.340 --> 03:29:32.060]   Having them describe some of the older,
[03:29:32.060 --> 03:29:34.540]   stinkier, darker heroin they used to get
[03:29:34.540 --> 03:29:36.600]   before this whole fentanyl thing
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:37.440]   and the highs they would get
[03:29:37.440 --> 03:29:39.020]   and how much they would have to take
[03:29:39.020 --> 03:29:41.060]   versus some of the stuff loaded with fentanyl
[03:29:41.060 --> 03:29:42.680]   that they have to--
[03:29:42.680 --> 03:29:46.060]   - Also there's more higher potency.
[03:29:46.060 --> 03:29:47.820]   - Yeah, there's a higher potency to it.
[03:29:47.820 --> 03:29:49.620]   And also there's a--
[03:29:49.620 --> 03:29:52.260]   - More money to be made, easier to transport.
[03:29:52.260 --> 03:29:53.100]   - Yeah.
[03:29:53.100 --> 03:29:55.660]   - But then is this how China
[03:29:55.660 --> 03:29:58.060]   starts becoming part of the picture?
[03:29:58.060 --> 03:30:00.180]   - One aspect to it that people kind of miss
[03:30:00.180 --> 03:30:03.540]   is that there's no Chinese cartel.
[03:30:03.540 --> 03:30:06.540]   There's no criminal Chinese organization
[03:30:06.540 --> 03:30:11.540]   working unseen, getting around government oversight in China.
[03:30:11.540 --> 03:30:15.700]   I don't know of any such organization.
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:16.940]   - Anything that could be labeled
[03:30:16.940 --> 03:30:18.340]   as a criminal organization
[03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:20.860]   is deeply integrated with the government.
[03:30:20.860 --> 03:30:24.620]   - I mean, I've never heard of a giant criminal enterprise
[03:30:24.620 --> 03:30:25.820]   in China operating.
[03:30:25.820 --> 03:30:27.740]   So we have to assume then--
[03:30:27.740 --> 03:30:29.580]   - Independent of the state.
[03:30:29.580 --> 03:30:32.100]   - I would have to assume that some of these things
[03:30:32.100 --> 03:30:33.640]   are happening with the know-how
[03:30:33.640 --> 03:30:36.260]   and inaction of the government out there.
[03:30:36.260 --> 03:30:42.740]   When COVID hit, there was a shortage of fentanyl
[03:30:42.740 --> 03:30:44.620]   on the northern side of Mexico,
[03:30:44.620 --> 03:30:47.100]   specifically related to the Sinaloa cartel.
[03:30:47.100 --> 03:30:49.580]   These guys were actually trafficking fentanyl
[03:30:49.580 --> 03:30:52.760]   from the US down to Mexico to infuse their product,
[03:30:52.760 --> 03:30:56.020]   but not the New Generation cartel,
[03:30:56.020 --> 03:30:58.460]   which operates out of the central part of Mexico,
[03:30:58.460 --> 03:31:02.980]   the Colima area, which have access to the seaside ports.
[03:31:02.980 --> 03:31:06.300]   So even during the shutdown, they were getting supplied,
[03:31:06.300 --> 03:31:08.340]   which means to me, at least,
[03:31:08.340 --> 03:31:09.900]   or for anybody observing it,
[03:31:09.900 --> 03:31:12.540]   that the supply chain was not cut.
[03:31:12.540 --> 03:31:14.380]   And whatever was coming out of China
[03:31:14.380 --> 03:31:17.780]   was being let out of China
[03:31:17.780 --> 03:31:20.100]   by whatever official channels
[03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:22.180]   would be able to shut down or stop it.
[03:31:22.180 --> 03:31:24.900]   - God, I would love to know the organizational structure,
[03:31:24.900 --> 03:31:27.520]   the governmental structure of China,
[03:31:27.520 --> 03:31:30.940]   how they enable it.
[03:31:30.940 --> 03:31:36.340]   Because I can't imagine at the very top,
[03:31:36.340 --> 03:31:38.420]   there's like a portfolio of things we're doing,
[03:31:38.420 --> 03:31:40.740]   and one of them is fentanyl, right?
[03:31:40.740 --> 03:31:42.300]   - I think it's more inaction,
[03:31:42.300 --> 03:31:44.820]   or just the know-how that is happening,
[03:31:44.820 --> 03:31:48.420]   but just like hands off, just let this, I don't know.
[03:31:48.420 --> 03:31:52.440]   - If I were to understand how large bureaucracies work,
[03:31:52.440 --> 03:31:54.060]   it's looking the other way.
[03:31:54.060 --> 03:31:58.820]   - Yeah, you are now seeing pill presses
[03:31:58.820 --> 03:32:01.700]   brought to Mexico, industrial-level pill presses
[03:32:01.700 --> 03:32:04.620]   found in clandestine laboratories,
[03:32:04.620 --> 03:32:08.920]   where they're not only infusing the yields
[03:32:08.920 --> 03:32:09.940]   that they're doing with fentanyl,
[03:32:09.940 --> 03:32:13.060]   but also making fake pain medication
[03:32:13.060 --> 03:32:15.660]   that is flooding US markets everywhere.
[03:32:15.660 --> 03:32:17.140]   That's where it is.
[03:32:17.140 --> 03:32:20.900]   Is that pain medication or is that fentanyl?
[03:32:20.900 --> 03:32:21.740]   Who knows?
[03:32:21.740 --> 03:32:24.260]   And that's how you see a lot of people dying from ODs
[03:32:24.260 --> 03:32:26.340]   that are supposedly taking pain pills,
[03:32:26.340 --> 03:32:28.500]   and that's not what they're doing.
[03:32:28.500 --> 03:32:30.060]   So the evolution right now you're seeing
[03:32:30.060 --> 03:32:34.580]   is making something look legit
[03:32:34.580 --> 03:32:36.380]   as far as pain medication that it isn't.
[03:32:36.380 --> 03:32:40.020]   And I mean, fentanyl is everywhere.
[03:32:40.020 --> 03:32:41.880]   They're infusing cocaine with it.
[03:32:41.880 --> 03:32:44.660]   I've been getting stories from the US
[03:32:44.660 --> 03:32:46.500]   of people buying it through Alibaba
[03:32:46.500 --> 03:32:47.940]   or just weird online sources,
[03:32:47.940 --> 03:32:49.700]   and it coming in different packages
[03:32:49.700 --> 03:32:53.900]   and just infusing it into whatever is out there.
[03:32:53.900 --> 03:32:57.040]   It is killing off a whole generation of people.
[03:32:57.040 --> 03:33:00.480]   And it comes from one place,
[03:33:00.480 --> 03:33:01.920]   or it's manufactured somewhere
[03:33:01.920 --> 03:33:05.420]   where it's being manufactured with the precursors
[03:33:05.420 --> 03:33:08.120]   and the element and know-how that comes from one place.
[03:33:08.120 --> 03:33:10.780]   - Are we talking about China?
[03:33:10.780 --> 03:33:11.620]   - Talking about China.
[03:33:11.620 --> 03:33:12.900]   - Because Mexico seems to have,
[03:33:12.900 --> 03:33:15.340]   what's the role, this is such a complicated,
[03:33:15.340 --> 03:33:17.780]   and how do you start to talk about the drug war
[03:33:17.780 --> 03:33:22.780]   when more and more and more China is the source of the drug?
[03:33:22.780 --> 03:33:28.640]   Is there a drug war going on with China?
[03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:30.140]   - There's probably an economic war.
[03:33:30.140 --> 03:33:32.920]   Well, you talk about, there's another side to China.
[03:33:34.020 --> 03:33:36.860]   The most, and this is something that's come out recently,
[03:33:36.860 --> 03:33:38.100]   a few years back, I think,
[03:33:38.100 --> 03:33:41.620]   but basically the ways you would move money back into Mexico
[03:33:41.620 --> 03:33:43.300]   after you have a load up here
[03:33:43.300 --> 03:33:46.340]   is that you would give it to a Chinese money broker.
[03:33:46.340 --> 03:33:48.300]   They would put it into the Chinese banking system
[03:33:48.300 --> 03:33:51.620]   and it immediately would just disappear from American eyes.
[03:33:51.620 --> 03:33:53.320]   And then another money broker in Mexico
[03:33:53.320 --> 03:33:55.740]   would receive it through a money transfer from China.
[03:33:55.740 --> 03:33:58.360]   - So China's incredibly good at money laundering.
[03:33:58.360 --> 03:34:00.900]   - That's another aspect to it.
[03:34:00.900 --> 03:34:03.500]   I mean, their banking system is invisible to the US,
[03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:04.820]   basically. - Which allows--
[03:34:04.820 --> 03:34:08.020]   - Which allows the monies to move from one point to another.
[03:34:08.020 --> 03:34:09.740]   So money brokers and people moving money
[03:34:09.740 --> 03:34:12.140]   for the groups down there are Chinese.
[03:34:12.140 --> 03:34:14.860]   So that's another aspect or element of China
[03:34:14.860 --> 03:34:16.420]   as far as its presence.
[03:34:16.420 --> 03:34:20.900]   - What's the role of intelligence in all of this?
[03:34:20.900 --> 03:34:25.700]   FBI, CIA, the Chinese intelligence agencies?
[03:34:27.380 --> 03:34:29.080]   - Right now, Mexico is going through
[03:34:29.080 --> 03:34:34.700]   a nationalistic resurgence and a leftist presidency,
[03:34:34.700 --> 03:34:38.700]   which is not friendly to US interest in a lot of ways.
[03:34:38.700 --> 03:34:42.260]   The US has had a pretty bad track record
[03:34:42.260 --> 03:34:44.260]   with its foreign policy in Mexico,
[03:34:44.260 --> 03:34:46.900]   with a lot of damage being done by the last president
[03:34:46.900 --> 03:34:49.060]   as far as his rhetoric.
[03:34:49.060 --> 03:34:50.140]   - Donald Trump?
[03:34:50.140 --> 03:34:51.900]   - Which has been weaponized and utilized
[03:34:51.900 --> 03:34:55.660]   by the left down in Mexico.
[03:34:55.660 --> 03:34:58.980]   - So America is not seen positively?
[03:34:58.980 --> 03:35:01.300]   - No, every now and then I post something about Mexico,
[03:35:01.300 --> 03:35:02.700]   some horrible thing happening down there.
[03:35:02.700 --> 03:35:05.140]   It's like, why doesn't US send people down there?
[03:35:05.140 --> 03:35:07.420]   Are Mexicans looking for US intervention?
[03:35:07.420 --> 03:35:09.980]   It's like, no, that is beyond what anybody
[03:35:09.980 --> 03:35:11.420]   in Mexico would want.
[03:35:11.420 --> 03:35:14.380]   Specifically, you see the sentiment out there.
[03:35:14.380 --> 03:35:17.220]   They don't view the US as somebody
[03:35:17.220 --> 03:35:18.500]   that's gonna come in and fix anything
[03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:21.460]   or somebody that's gonna help or as a friend.
[03:35:21.460 --> 03:35:24.000]   When the Ukrainian conflict happened,
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:29.840]   Mexico basically abstained from saying anything,
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:32.280]   which is a wink and a nod to Russia.
[03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:37.200]   It has openly been pro Maduro and openly celebrated
[03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:42.000]   to some of these regimes popping up across Latin America,
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:46.400]   which is, that is what people voted for.
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:47.760]   That is a sentiment down there.
[03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:49.980]   They're going towards the left of the political spectrum
[03:35:49.980 --> 03:35:53.980]   because they've been basically violated over and over again
[03:35:53.980 --> 03:35:55.680]   by all these different presidencies
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:58.740]   that have promised change, brought corruption with them,
[03:35:58.740 --> 03:36:00.640]   and they are our choices.
[03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:02.720]   So this is the best we have right now.
[03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:06.520]   And all of the enemies of the United States
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:08.280]   are taking full advantage of that.
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:11.000]   We recently had a general address
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:12.760]   to the Senate committee hearing, I think.
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:14.960]   He was talking about the prevalence
[03:36:14.960 --> 03:36:19.960]   of foreign intelligence services in Mexico and why that is.
[03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:24.540]   Well, you know, Mexico has a lot of the mineable lithium
[03:36:24.540 --> 03:36:26.860]   on the planet underneath parts of it,
[03:36:26.860 --> 03:36:28.180]   specifically in the north.
[03:36:28.180 --> 03:36:31.680]   It is going through a process,
[03:36:31.680 --> 03:36:34.100]   they call it the Cuarta Transformación,
[03:36:34.100 --> 03:36:36.020]   the fourth transformation is what the president
[03:36:36.020 --> 03:36:40.020]   of Mexico calls it, which is, in a way,
[03:36:40.020 --> 03:36:42.940]   it's basically we're here to stay type thing.
[03:36:42.940 --> 03:36:46.500]   You know, they just nationalized mining lithium
[03:36:46.500 --> 03:36:48.500]   and taking control of that and using that as leverage.
[03:36:48.500 --> 03:36:50.820]   If the United States ever wants to go to Mexico,
[03:36:50.820 --> 03:36:53.300]   it's probably not gonna be related to cartel issues.
[03:36:53.300 --> 03:36:55.300]   It's gonna probably be related to energy, I think.
[03:36:55.300 --> 03:36:58.580]   You know, they're kinda thinking ahead, I guess.
[03:36:58.580 --> 03:37:01.660]   - Well, what about also, just imagine a world
[03:37:01.660 --> 03:37:07.020]   where India and China are doing fentanyl trade
[03:37:07.020 --> 03:37:09.360]   with Mexico or whatever transport.
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:15.060]   Imagine Chinese military moves, makes an agreement,
[03:37:15.060 --> 03:37:17.600]   a NATO type of agreement with Mexico.
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:18.860]   That's pretty possible.
[03:37:18.860 --> 03:37:21.620]   Again, we're seeing a militarized Mexico.
[03:37:21.620 --> 03:37:23.740]   It's another aspect of Mexico that, again,
[03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:26.920]   I haven't seen talked about a lot here in the US.
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:28.940]   The main promise that the current president had
[03:37:28.940 --> 03:37:31.920]   was he was gonna make the police, the federal police,
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:36.920]   and the security issues in Mexico civilian.
[03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:39.620]   He was gonna do exactly the opposite
[03:37:39.620 --> 03:37:42.180]   as his main rival, Felipe Calderon,
[03:37:42.180 --> 03:37:44.660]   the guy that started off the drug war officially.
[03:37:44.660 --> 03:37:47.060]   And what does he do?
[03:37:47.060 --> 03:37:50.480]   He dissolves the civilian leadership of the federal police,
[03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:53.800]   dissolves the federal police, creates the National Guard,
[03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:55.680]   which is a military unit,
[03:37:55.680 --> 03:37:58.380]   and he puts the military in charge of that.
[03:37:58.380 --> 03:38:00.500]   Now the military has a full monopoly
[03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:02.740]   over all federal policing.
[03:38:02.740 --> 03:38:05.000]   When you cross into Mexico,
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:07.420]   you'll see them wearing these white camouflage uniforms.
[03:38:07.420 --> 03:38:11.080]   Those are National Guard people,
[03:38:11.080 --> 03:38:13.600]   but they're the military.
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:16.200]   So now you're seeing a militarized Mexico
[03:38:16.200 --> 03:38:17.800]   with some of these leaks that happened
[03:38:17.800 --> 03:38:20.900]   during the Guacamaya, the Guacamaya leaks.
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:23.800]   You're now seeing that Mexico has been hosting
[03:38:23.800 --> 03:38:26.300]   members of the Haitian military,
[03:38:26.300 --> 03:38:27.900]   and they've been training them up
[03:38:27.900 --> 03:38:31.400]   to go back to police their country.
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:34.620]   That's not something that Mexico has been known for,
[03:38:34.620 --> 03:38:37.520]   to hosting other nations and training them in such a way.
[03:38:37.520 --> 03:38:40.800]   So it's an interesting maneuver.
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:42.660]   Like Mexico has been historically neutral
[03:38:42.660 --> 03:38:45.660]   about getting involved in foreign conflicts,
[03:38:45.660 --> 03:38:48.400]   about voting and resolutions as far as invading
[03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:51.180]   or not invading or doing all of these things.
[03:38:51.180 --> 03:38:53.060]   Mexico has been historically kind of neutral
[03:38:53.060 --> 03:38:54.100]   when it comes to some of these things.
[03:38:54.100 --> 03:38:57.460]   And now we're training foreign military forces
[03:38:57.460 --> 03:38:59.660]   to go and do that role somewhere else.
[03:38:59.660 --> 03:39:02.900]   We have the military building airports
[03:39:02.900 --> 03:39:04.620]   and building infrastructure in Mexico,
[03:39:04.620 --> 03:39:06.140]   and a lot of their higher ups
[03:39:06.140 --> 03:39:08.740]   getting very wealthy around it.
[03:39:08.740 --> 03:39:12.580]   And they basically have a monopoly over
[03:39:14.140 --> 03:39:16.100]   who gets to have guns down there.
[03:39:16.100 --> 03:39:17.800]   There's one gun store in all Mexico
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:19.340]   and it's run by the military.
[03:39:19.340 --> 03:39:21.000]   And the only way you can buy a gun there
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:23.620]   is if you can buy a plane ticket to fly there
[03:39:23.620 --> 03:39:26.180]   and have enough money to sustain that right
[03:39:26.180 --> 03:39:27.780]   or that privilege.
[03:39:27.780 --> 03:39:31.240]   So you're seeing the military not being
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:34.520]   in its traditional role of just being the security force.
[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:35.860]   Now it's policing.
[03:39:35.860 --> 03:39:39.760]   It's involved in, it's getting involved in politics
[03:39:39.760 --> 03:39:41.080]   in a big way.
[03:39:41.080 --> 03:39:44.780]   It's legislation that has passed to keep it on the streets
[03:39:44.780 --> 03:39:47.100]   and the policing role for more years now.
[03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:51.100]   So that should be looked at closer by anybody observing it
[03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:53.380]   from afar, the militarization of Mexico
[03:39:53.380 --> 03:39:54.800]   and where it's going.
[03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:57.300]   - Because if you move towards a world
[03:39:57.300 --> 03:39:59.620]   where a World War III happens,
[03:39:59.620 --> 03:40:03.140]   it feels like Mexico will be the center
[03:40:03.140 --> 03:40:07.460]   because a hot war would be fought on the ground.
[03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:10.500]   And so you have a very difficult parallel
[03:40:10.500 --> 03:40:12.260]   between Mexico and Ukraine.
[03:40:12.260 --> 03:40:15.420]   Both don't have nuclear weapons, both have relationships.
[03:40:15.420 --> 03:40:18.740]   So Ukraine has a relationship or a pull towards it,
[03:40:18.740 --> 03:40:21.300]   the European Union and NATO.
[03:40:21.300 --> 03:40:24.940]   Mexico, at least currently, has a kind of slow pull
[03:40:24.940 --> 03:40:29.100]   towards China, India potentially, and Russia.
[03:40:29.100 --> 03:40:33.620]   And you have this divide between power centers in the world.
[03:40:33.620 --> 03:40:38.380]   And in terms of, just imagine hundreds of thousands
[03:40:38.380 --> 03:40:42.100]   of Mexican troops, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops
[03:40:42.100 --> 03:40:47.100]   on the border, on the US border, on the Mexican side.
[03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:50.100]   - And also the fact that that border doesn't mean anything
[03:40:50.100 --> 03:40:54.220]   to any sort of conflict that would happen regionally
[03:40:54.220 --> 03:40:57.580]   because that's a very easy to cross border.
[03:40:57.580 --> 03:40:59.980]   Doesn't matter how many walls you put across it,
[03:40:59.980 --> 03:41:01.280]   people are already here.
[03:41:01.280 --> 03:41:03.660]   This is not gonna be a war fought off
[03:41:03.660 --> 03:41:05.580]   in some overseas place.
[03:41:05.580 --> 03:41:09.020]   Like you're not gonna, this is something, if it happens,
[03:41:09.020 --> 03:41:12.140]   if destabilization is utilized in Mexico
[03:41:12.140 --> 03:41:15.180]   to cause a conflict there and it turns into a Vietnam
[03:41:15.180 --> 03:41:17.900]   or a proxy war down there of a sort,
[03:41:17.900 --> 03:41:21.140]   which I think in a way you're already kind of seeing
[03:41:21.140 --> 03:41:23.140]   some of that through some of the conflicts
[03:41:23.140 --> 03:41:24.080]   going on down there.
[03:41:24.080 --> 03:41:28.660]   You have a new generation cartel that is being fed fentanyl
[03:41:28.660 --> 03:41:30.580]   from the Pacific side ports.
[03:41:30.580 --> 03:41:35.420]   And suspiciously, you wanna think that maybe
[03:41:35.420 --> 03:41:37.860]   it's favored by a foreign government of some sort
[03:41:37.860 --> 03:41:40.880]   in some way, shape or form, who knows.
[03:41:40.880 --> 03:41:42.940]   And then you have a historically in control
[03:41:42.940 --> 03:41:46.140]   Sinaloa cartel that may or may not be favored by the US
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:47.940]   in some way, shape or form.
[03:41:47.940 --> 03:41:51.180]   You can imagine a further conflict down there
[03:41:51.180 --> 03:41:54.300]   and people fostering it and seeing the effects
[03:41:54.300 --> 03:41:59.260]   of basically setting a fire on the feet of the United States.
[03:41:59.260 --> 03:42:02.760]   It's second largest consumer of US products is Mexico.
[03:42:04.220 --> 03:42:07.420]   The massive wave of immigration
[03:42:07.420 --> 03:42:09.880]   that is going to be basically weaponized.
[03:42:09.880 --> 03:42:14.360]   You saw the collapse of the border security structure
[03:42:14.360 --> 03:42:19.360]   with a contingent of 3000 Honduran Guatemalan immigrants
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:23.720]   in that first wave of caravans coming to Tijuana.
[03:42:23.720 --> 03:42:26.080]   You saw, it was pretty bad.
[03:42:26.080 --> 03:42:30.260]   It was pretty bad and it could have gotten worse.
[03:42:30.260 --> 03:42:32.500]   Now, what is gonna happen when that wave
[03:42:32.500 --> 03:42:36.620]   is no longer 3000, but a million people
[03:42:36.620 --> 03:42:40.740]   being displaced by violence or being in fear
[03:42:40.740 --> 03:42:43.820]   of whatever conflict might originate down there
[03:42:43.820 --> 03:42:47.140]   and just that massive wave of migration and move.
[03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:52.060]   I think that's an interesting thing
[03:42:52.060 --> 03:42:56.580]   that people should look at and how can you affect change
[03:42:56.580 --> 03:43:00.020]   to try and stop some of these things to happen.
[03:43:00.020 --> 03:43:02.500]   - Well, let me ask you at a philosophical, at a human level,
[03:43:02.500 --> 03:43:04.580]   what do you think about immigration?
[03:43:04.580 --> 03:43:09.580]   Illegal and legal immigration from the direction of Mexico
[03:43:09.580 --> 03:43:11.680]   to the United States?
[03:43:11.680 --> 03:43:14.940]   So we have an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants
[03:43:14.940 --> 03:43:19.940]   in the United States and estimated 45 million legal
[03:43:19.940 --> 03:43:22.740]   immigrants in the United States.
[03:43:22.740 --> 03:43:24.980]   - A few things about that.
[03:43:24.980 --> 03:43:28.660]   When COVID hit, there was no shortages of produce
[03:43:28.660 --> 03:43:31.600]   in the supermarkets, which means that,
[03:43:31.600 --> 03:43:34.500]   I mean, illegal immigration is pretty much
[03:43:34.500 --> 03:43:37.340]   the backbone of all produce and some of the farming
[03:43:37.340 --> 03:43:40.280]   industries out there, most of it.
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:44.620]   So illegal immigration and illegal workers
[03:43:44.620 --> 03:43:47.860]   in those fields are essential workers in a way.
[03:43:47.860 --> 03:43:49.840]   I think there's a weird relationship in the United States
[03:43:49.840 --> 03:43:52.220]   with some of these workers and how they're demonized
[03:43:52.220 --> 03:43:53.740]   and how they're called criminals.
[03:43:53.740 --> 03:43:57.420]   I think there was a state out there that passed
[03:43:57.420 --> 03:44:01.940]   anti-illegal immigrant worker legislation.
[03:44:01.940 --> 03:44:05.980]   The farmers had to look elsewhere for people to show up
[03:44:05.980 --> 03:44:08.860]   to work in some of these fields, which basically caused
[03:44:08.860 --> 03:44:10.640]   millions of dollars worth of losses
[03:44:10.640 --> 03:44:12.340]   for some of these farms.
[03:44:12.340 --> 03:44:15.640]   Anywhere you go out there in the United States,
[03:44:15.640 --> 03:44:18.020]   you go into the kitchens and there's gonna be paisanos
[03:44:18.020 --> 03:44:21.460]   there, you know, French, high-level French restaurants.
[03:44:21.460 --> 03:44:24.300]   You'll see people from Puebla there that made their way
[03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:28.420]   legally and might have legalized or regularized their way
[03:44:28.420 --> 03:44:31.500]   into the country or in a sanctuary city.
[03:44:31.500 --> 03:44:35.060]   You go to the service industry, hotels, you know,
[03:44:35.060 --> 03:44:37.220]   those are the people changing the blankets.
[03:44:37.220 --> 03:44:39.820]   Those are the people in the washrooms.
[03:44:39.820 --> 03:44:43.060]   You have them doing jobs that no American wants to do,
[03:44:43.060 --> 03:44:45.700]   realistically, and they're everywhere in this country.
[03:44:45.700 --> 03:44:48.960]   And they are the backbone of some of these industries
[03:44:48.960 --> 03:44:50.780]   that are essential in this country.
[03:44:50.780 --> 03:44:52.220]   - Do you think there's a deep sense
[03:44:52.220 --> 03:44:54.340]   in which they are American?
[03:44:54.340 --> 03:44:55.820]   - I think they're indispensable.
[03:44:55.820 --> 03:45:00.380]   And anybody that says they aren't is delusional.
[03:45:00.380 --> 03:45:03.460]   If you take every single legal worker out of the industry
[03:45:03.460 --> 03:45:05.740]   in the United States and send them back,
[03:45:05.740 --> 03:45:07.220]   like there's a movie out there called,
[03:45:07.220 --> 03:45:10.660]   like "El Día Sin Mexicanos", "A Day Without Mexicans",
[03:45:10.660 --> 03:45:13.940]   you know, everything would stop.
[03:45:13.940 --> 03:45:16.580]   So the relationship is there.
[03:45:16.580 --> 03:45:20.140]   People talk about the history of slavery in this country.
[03:45:20.140 --> 03:45:22.100]   Like it's a thing that is in the past.
[03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:26.660]   There's endangered slaves in the country right now.
[03:45:26.660 --> 03:45:30.060]   People that are paying off their people smugglers
[03:45:30.060 --> 03:45:31.380]   because they brought them into this country
[03:45:31.380 --> 03:45:35.060]   and they haven't been able to pay that fine or that fee yet
[03:45:35.060 --> 03:45:37.220]   and are basically being held hostage by that
[03:45:37.220 --> 03:45:38.700]   here in the United States.
[03:45:38.700 --> 03:45:40.500]   So there's slaves right now in the United States.
[03:45:40.500 --> 03:45:41.580]   You know, people are talking about it
[03:45:41.580 --> 03:45:43.660]   as a historical context.
[03:45:43.660 --> 03:45:44.980]   - What do we do about it?
[03:45:44.980 --> 03:45:46.420]   How are we supposed to think about it?
[03:45:46.420 --> 03:45:49.500]   - We're gonna have to rethink how we look at immigration,
[03:45:49.500 --> 03:45:53.380]   illegal or legal immigration from Mexico
[03:45:53.380 --> 03:45:56.660]   and how we view Mexico as a foreign country.
[03:45:56.660 --> 03:46:00.660]   Your relationship to Canada is one thing.
[03:46:00.660 --> 03:46:02.620]   Your relationship to Mexico is another.
[03:46:02.620 --> 03:46:08.420]   The foreign policy towards Mexico has been pretty nefarious
[03:46:08.420 --> 03:46:10.900]   as far as the United States in a lot of ways.
[03:46:10.900 --> 03:46:12.420]   You know, you can go back.
[03:46:12.420 --> 03:46:15.700]   There was a student massacre during the Olympics
[03:46:15.700 --> 03:46:19.900]   and the president in turn at that time was on the CIA payroll
[03:46:19.900 --> 03:46:22.980]   and it was a counter communist type maneuver
[03:46:22.980 --> 03:46:24.780]   that they were doing down there.
[03:46:24.780 --> 03:46:28.340]   But there's some bloody hands on the US side
[03:46:28.340 --> 03:46:30.860]   of some of the things that have been happening in Mexico
[03:46:30.860 --> 03:46:32.900]   as far as destabilization and influencing
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:36.100]   and meddling in foreign policy out there.
[03:46:36.100 --> 03:46:37.700]   Most of the guns that are used down there
[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:39.260]   come from the US, you know?
[03:46:39.260 --> 03:46:42.020]   And that's another interesting aspect and responsibility
[03:46:42.020 --> 03:46:44.580]   that people shouldn't kind of think about up here.
[03:46:44.580 --> 03:46:47.300]   - So there is on the drug war side,
[03:46:47.300 --> 03:46:50.820]   a machine that's fueling the drug war.
[03:46:50.820 --> 03:46:53.380]   - I mean, there's a giant drug habit up here, you know?
[03:46:53.380 --> 03:46:56.500]   - But also a governmental intelligence
[03:46:56.500 --> 03:46:59.540]   and military support through the sale of weapons.
[03:46:59.540 --> 03:47:00.820]   - I don't know about the sale of weapons,
[03:47:00.820 --> 03:47:03.180]   but you know, there's some very,
[03:47:03.180 --> 03:47:07.580]   you talk about poorest borders coming up.
[03:47:07.580 --> 03:47:10.060]   There's poorest borders also going down, you know?
[03:47:10.060 --> 03:47:14.420]   There's a flow of guns going down and munitions,
[03:47:14.420 --> 03:47:16.860]   which again, they don't kill anybody by themselves.
[03:47:16.860 --> 03:47:19.100]   You know, they get put in the hands of the desperate
[03:47:19.100 --> 03:47:21.860]   that are trying to feed a giant drug market
[03:47:21.860 --> 03:47:23.300]   to the south, to the north.
[03:47:23.300 --> 03:47:24.740]   You know, Mexico has a saying,
[03:47:24.740 --> 03:47:29.500]   "Mexico, Mexico, (speaking in foreign language)
[03:47:29.500 --> 03:47:32.500]   "Mexico, far from God, but close to the United States."
[03:47:32.500 --> 03:47:38.700]   And there's definitely a responsibility on both sides.
[03:47:38.700 --> 03:47:41.980]   This is no longer a Mexico problem, a US problem.
[03:47:41.980 --> 03:47:44.180]   This is a regional problem.
[03:47:44.180 --> 03:47:46.540]   And if we don't think of it as a regional problem
[03:47:46.540 --> 03:47:49.180]   with our brothers on the southern side of it,
[03:47:49.180 --> 03:47:52.260]   and with family, we're related in blood.
[03:47:52.260 --> 03:47:53.380]   There's like, we are,
[03:47:53.380 --> 03:47:57.140]   Mexico and the United States are like this,
[03:47:57.140 --> 03:47:59.620]   but it's become popular in politics.
[03:47:59.620 --> 03:48:02.420]   They just throw a line, right?
[03:48:02.420 --> 03:48:04.900]   And I think we need to get to a place
[03:48:04.900 --> 03:48:06.940]   where we can figure out how to make those connections
[03:48:06.940 --> 03:48:09.100]   and repair some of the damage done by like,
[03:48:09.100 --> 03:48:11.780]   just years and years of bad policy
[03:48:11.780 --> 03:48:13.220]   on both sides of the border.
[03:48:13.220 --> 03:48:15.420]   - Policy and rhetoric, the way we talk about it,
[03:48:15.420 --> 03:48:17.660]   the way we think about it, not just the actual policy,
[03:48:17.660 --> 03:48:20.980]   but seeing the humanity in the people that are here.
[03:48:20.980 --> 03:48:22.380]   - Yeah, it's an easy thing.
[03:48:22.380 --> 03:48:25.740]   They're coming to take our jobs is something you hear.
[03:48:25.740 --> 03:48:30.740]   There was a state out there that passed some anti-legislation
[03:48:30.740 --> 03:48:33.420]   as far as illegal workers on fields.
[03:48:33.420 --> 03:48:35.340]   And it led to massive losses.
[03:48:35.340 --> 03:48:38.180]   Nobody wanted to show up for those jobs, basically.
[03:48:38.180 --> 03:48:40.060]   People would show up one day and they wouldn't come back,
[03:48:40.060 --> 03:48:42.860]   and they were doing jobs that people just don't wanna do.
[03:48:43.580 --> 03:48:46.420]   Are they taking that from the locals?
[03:48:46.420 --> 03:48:48.340]   Or are they filling an essential role
[03:48:48.340 --> 03:48:50.820]   that we feel guilty about?
[03:48:50.820 --> 03:48:55.380]   And the rhetoric around it is more about guilt than anything.
[03:48:55.380 --> 03:48:58.620]   I am an immigrant myself.
[03:48:58.620 --> 03:49:03.100]   I've gone through the experience of doing it legally,
[03:49:03.100 --> 03:49:07.020]   and I've seen people not do it legally
[03:49:07.020 --> 03:49:11.180]   and are in way better places than I am, basically,
[03:49:11.180 --> 03:49:13.660]   by going around some of the system.
[03:49:13.660 --> 03:49:16.820]   The system itself, the immigration system here in the US,
[03:49:16.820 --> 03:49:19.540]   there's something wrong.
[03:49:19.540 --> 03:49:20.540]   It's kind of broken.
[03:49:20.540 --> 03:49:26.220]   And people coming here illegally are not only,
[03:49:26.220 --> 03:49:28.740]   they're looking for a better life for themselves,
[03:49:28.740 --> 03:49:30.260]   a better life for people.
[03:49:30.260 --> 03:49:31.900]   This whole aspect of vilifying them,
[03:49:31.900 --> 03:49:34.260]   and they're like, "Oh, this immigrant
[03:49:34.260 --> 03:49:35.220]   "did this horrible thing.
[03:49:35.220 --> 03:49:37.380]   "This immigrant did that horrible thing."
[03:49:37.420 --> 03:49:41.460]   And people saying, "Go back to your country."
[03:49:41.460 --> 03:49:43.380]   At the same time, they go to a hotel
[03:49:43.380 --> 03:49:46.860]   where all the service staff is from that part of the world,
[03:49:46.860 --> 03:49:49.060]   and they're here irregularly.
[03:49:49.060 --> 03:49:51.340]   Or they go to the Whole Foods,
[03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:53.020]   and they get some produce there,
[03:49:53.020 --> 03:49:56.900]   and it's picked by some of the same people they're vilifying.
[03:49:56.900 --> 03:50:00.580]   And again, we need to kind of think about that
[03:50:00.580 --> 03:50:02.420]   and analyze that for ourselves.
[03:50:02.420 --> 03:50:04.460]   - Yeah, the idea of go back to your country
[03:50:04.460 --> 03:50:07.500]   and finding the other and having a disdain
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:09.220]   and a hate towards the other.
[03:50:09.220 --> 03:50:12.180]   Ever since I had a recent conversation with Ye,
[03:50:12.180 --> 03:50:13.820]   formerly known as Kanye West,
[03:50:13.820 --> 03:50:17.020]   I got to hear a few things from,
[03:50:17.020 --> 03:50:23.020]   let's say, unfriendly messages from white nationalists.
[03:50:23.020 --> 03:50:25.060]   And I got to learn about this world.
[03:50:25.060 --> 03:50:28.460]   I continue on the journey of learning,
[03:50:28.460 --> 03:50:30.580]   which is the idea that the United States,
[03:50:30.580 --> 03:50:32.660]   this country, should look a certain way,
[03:50:32.660 --> 03:50:33.980]   should have a certain skin color,
[03:50:33.980 --> 03:50:35.500]   should have a certain religion,
[03:50:35.500 --> 03:50:39.180]   and everything else is a pollution, is a poison to this.
[03:50:39.180 --> 03:50:41.260]   I may sound hateful right now,
[03:50:41.260 --> 03:50:44.380]   but they usually frame it in a positive way,
[03:50:44.380 --> 03:50:45.420]   like the purity.
[03:50:45.420 --> 03:50:48.540]   I'm sure Hitler also phrased everything in a positive way,
[03:50:48.540 --> 03:50:51.440]   especially in the 1930s, about the purity of Germany.
[03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:52.820]   But the reality of the United States,
[03:50:52.820 --> 03:50:55.460]   and one of the things that makes it,
[03:50:55.460 --> 03:50:56.980]   at least the ideal of the United States,
[03:50:56.980 --> 03:50:58.980]   is the soup, the mix.
[03:50:58.980 --> 03:51:01.820]   Unlike so many nations I've traveled to,
[03:51:01.820 --> 03:51:04.580]   the diversity, the good kind of diversity,
[03:51:04.580 --> 03:51:07.140]   is what makes this country great.
[03:51:07.140 --> 03:51:10.740]   And so I think it needs to be based on
[03:51:10.740 --> 03:51:14.900]   accepting the different subgroups
[03:51:14.900 --> 03:51:16.020]   that make up the United States,
[03:51:16.020 --> 03:51:17.540]   versus trying to purify it.
[03:51:17.540 --> 03:51:21.220]   And I think Mexican immigrants is just another flavor
[03:51:21.220 --> 03:51:23.500]   of saying, "This is the other.
[03:51:23.500 --> 03:51:24.860]   "Let's reject the other."
[03:51:24.860 --> 03:51:26.900]   - Yeah, I saw that interview, by the way.
[03:51:28.100 --> 03:51:31.460]   That you showed a basic restraint in that interview.
[03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:35.020]   My experience, and I came up here,
[03:51:35.020 --> 03:51:37.980]   again, Trump was elected when I came up here,
[03:51:37.980 --> 03:51:40.620]   so it was a weird time for me,
[03:51:40.620 --> 03:51:42.060]   as far as being an immigrant
[03:51:42.060 --> 03:51:44.060]   and the immigrant experience for myself,
[03:51:44.060 --> 03:51:48.340]   by both being basically the bad,
[03:51:48.340 --> 03:51:52.220]   the ones that were talked about in that way,
[03:51:52.220 --> 03:51:53.380]   and also having a bunch of my friends
[03:51:53.380 --> 03:51:54.380]   who were very conservative,
[03:51:54.380 --> 03:51:57.340]   and wearing some of those MAGA hats around me,
[03:51:57.340 --> 03:51:58.380]   and like, "Hey, Ed."
[03:51:58.380 --> 03:52:04.820]   Well, I mean, I'm a guest here, so I have to,
[03:52:04.820 --> 03:52:07.420]   but it's a balancing act,
[03:52:07.420 --> 03:52:10.380]   is what I've been looking at it as.
[03:52:10.380 --> 03:52:14.020]   On one side, there's the woke side of it,
[03:52:14.020 --> 03:52:15.180]   which everything goes,
[03:52:15.180 --> 03:52:16.140]   and then the other side is like,
[03:52:16.140 --> 03:52:17.500]   "Let's hold on to some of these things
[03:52:17.500 --> 03:52:19.500]   "that make us who we are."
[03:52:19.500 --> 03:52:21.740]   On my end, I wanna get to a place
[03:52:21.740 --> 03:52:24.940]   where I can smoke a joint, conceal, carry a firearm,
[03:52:24.940 --> 03:52:27.100]   be at my gay best friend's wedding,
[03:52:27.100 --> 03:52:29.460]   and I want the government not to say anything about it,
[03:52:29.460 --> 03:52:31.500]   and I think there's parts in the United States here
[03:52:31.500 --> 03:52:33.460]   that kind of feel the same way,
[03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:35.220]   but there's extremes on both sides
[03:52:35.220 --> 03:52:37.620]   that are pulling you to one side or the other,
[03:52:37.620 --> 03:52:40.900]   and I've seen more of the United States than most Americans.
[03:52:40.900 --> 03:52:43.260]   I'm in a different state every weekend,
[03:52:43.260 --> 03:52:44.420]   so I get to go to,
[03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:47.780]   I'm going to Tampa tomorrow,
[03:52:47.780 --> 03:52:50.300]   then I'm going back to California,
[03:52:50.300 --> 03:52:52.460]   then I'm going to Tennessee later,
[03:52:52.460 --> 03:52:55.260]   then Kentucky, so I get to see all types of people
[03:52:55.260 --> 03:52:56.820]   and all types of mentalities,
[03:52:56.820 --> 03:52:58.340]   and ways that people live,
[03:52:58.340 --> 03:53:01.900]   and this country is more diverse than most would think,
[03:53:01.900 --> 03:53:02.980]   you know, if you only see it
[03:53:02.980 --> 03:53:05.660]   through the lens of television or media.
[03:53:05.660 --> 03:53:07.740]   What I keep seeing out there that, for me,
[03:53:07.740 --> 03:53:12.740]   is like the reason I came here, I guess,
[03:53:12.740 --> 03:53:16.460]   and a lot of the reasons that I feel a vested interest
[03:53:16.460 --> 03:53:19.740]   in this country, not just because, again, my kid's American,
[03:53:19.740 --> 03:53:22.100]   so I have a very, very big interest
[03:53:22.100 --> 03:53:23.740]   in this country doing well,
[03:53:23.780 --> 03:53:27.460]   but a thing I see is there's still the opportunity
[03:53:27.460 --> 03:53:30.060]   and the ability to do something with yourself
[03:53:30.060 --> 03:53:32.420]   and opportunities out there for people like me
[03:53:32.420 --> 03:53:33.620]   that come here with nothing.
[03:53:33.620 --> 03:53:38.620]   I came here with an experience base, a truck.
[03:53:38.620 --> 03:53:40.300]   - And some demons.
[03:53:40.300 --> 03:53:42.780]   - And yeah, and a bunch of demons in a bag,
[03:53:42.780 --> 03:53:45.980]   and I'm here with you talking right now
[03:53:45.980 --> 03:53:47.380]   about some of those experiences.
[03:53:47.380 --> 03:53:49.020]   - To another immigrant.
[03:53:49.020 --> 03:53:49.900]   - To another immigrant,
[03:53:49.900 --> 03:53:53.060]   and both of us are reaching people out there
[03:53:53.060 --> 03:53:57.620]   that might not, haven't heard a voice of people like us
[03:53:57.620 --> 03:54:02.220]   that come here with our own bag of demons,
[03:54:02.220 --> 03:54:05.020]   but where else in the world can two people like us
[03:54:05.020 --> 03:54:07.540]   have a conversation with an audience like us
[03:54:07.540 --> 03:54:10.180]   and not be shot outside of this
[03:54:10.180 --> 03:54:11.620]   because of the stuff we're saying?
[03:54:11.620 --> 03:54:16.620]   - Yeah, listen to with love and respect, not derision.
[03:54:16.620 --> 03:54:21.460]   Let me ask you for advice.
[03:54:21.460 --> 03:54:23.780]   What would you say to young folks,
[03:54:23.780 --> 03:54:27.060]   wherever they come from?
[03:54:27.060 --> 03:54:28.540]   So in high school and college,
[03:54:28.540 --> 03:54:31.740]   they're thinking of how to live a life,
[03:54:31.740 --> 03:54:34.420]   have a career they can be proud of,
[03:54:34.420 --> 03:54:36.420]   and especially if they're struggling,
[03:54:36.420 --> 03:54:38.860]   especially if they're at a low point like you were
[03:54:38.860 --> 03:54:41.020]   when you came here.
[03:54:41.020 --> 03:54:41.900]   - Travel.
[03:54:41.900 --> 03:54:44.060]   Travel is one of the biggest things in the world
[03:54:44.060 --> 03:54:47.060]   that I would ask people to kind of go out to,
[03:54:47.060 --> 03:54:48.300]   see how other people live.
[03:54:48.300 --> 03:54:50.900]   Don't go there with your own preconceived notions
[03:54:50.900 --> 03:54:53.540]   or trying to make people act like you act.
[03:54:53.540 --> 03:54:57.100]   Go out there and travel and actually experience the world.
[03:54:57.100 --> 03:54:59.580]   It doesn't have to be another country.
[03:54:59.580 --> 03:55:02.660]   Going from Tennessee to Seattle
[03:55:02.660 --> 03:55:06.860]   is a pretty interesting change of scenery.
[03:55:06.860 --> 03:55:08.060]   - Who's better at knife fighting?
[03:55:08.060 --> 03:55:10.020]   Just kidding, you don't have to answer that.
[03:55:10.020 --> 03:55:11.220]   (laughing)
[03:55:11.220 --> 03:55:12.620]   - Tennessee.
[03:55:12.620 --> 03:55:15.780]   But the traveling is one,
[03:55:15.780 --> 03:55:17.500]   and knowing how other people live
[03:55:17.500 --> 03:55:20.580]   is one aspect of it that I would tell people.
[03:55:20.580 --> 03:55:22.020]   It's risky, it's dangerous,
[03:55:22.020 --> 03:55:23.860]   but that is part of the journey
[03:55:23.860 --> 03:55:26.300]   is one of the things I would ask young people
[03:55:26.300 --> 03:55:27.460]   to kind of consider.
[03:55:27.460 --> 03:55:30.540]   Service is essential,
[03:55:30.540 --> 03:55:33.340]   and it should be at the basis of all of our lives.
[03:55:33.340 --> 03:55:35.940]   Service, start there, start with service.
[03:55:35.940 --> 03:55:40.060]   In any industry, you're gonna go start your own restaurant,
[03:55:40.060 --> 03:55:42.260]   you have to work in the kitchen first, service.
[03:55:42.260 --> 03:55:43.380]   If you're gonna be a part,
[03:55:43.380 --> 03:55:45.660]   a productive member of this country, service.
[03:55:45.660 --> 03:55:47.500]   And I'm not talking just about the military,
[03:55:47.500 --> 03:55:49.540]   because the military, it's a process,
[03:55:49.540 --> 03:55:50.860]   and it's a lifestyle, and it's a thing
[03:55:50.860 --> 03:55:52.220]   for some people out there.
[03:55:52.220 --> 03:55:53.460]   It's not even a choice for other people
[03:55:53.460 --> 03:55:55.780]   if they want an education, and I get that.
[03:55:55.780 --> 03:55:59.980]   Community service of any kind is an essential thing.
[03:55:59.980 --> 03:56:02.620]   The ability to go out there and interact with the people
[03:56:02.620 --> 03:56:04.460]   that you would normally not interact with,
[03:56:04.460 --> 03:56:07.900]   the homeless population that there is in this country,
[03:56:07.900 --> 03:56:11.780]   the older population that, in Mexico,
[03:56:11.780 --> 03:56:14.020]   our old die in our homes,
[03:56:14.020 --> 03:56:17.740]   but here you send them off somewhere else to die,
[03:56:17.740 --> 03:56:19.420]   which is an interesting, weird detachment
[03:56:19.420 --> 03:56:21.700]   that I've seen in the US as far as
[03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:24.220]   how the elders are cast aside.
[03:56:24.220 --> 03:56:27.660]   If I can say anything to young people,
[03:56:27.660 --> 03:56:30.340]   is to start figuring out a life of service,
[03:56:30.340 --> 03:56:33.660]   and that's gonna expose you to a bunch of experiences,
[03:56:33.660 --> 03:56:34.620]   to a bunch of people out there
[03:56:34.620 --> 03:56:38.420]   that you might not regularly meet and see, and realities.
[03:56:38.420 --> 03:56:41.700]   Education is out there.
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:45.540]   It is expensive, but I've sat through a bunch
[03:56:45.540 --> 03:56:47.060]   of really expensive classes
[03:56:47.060 --> 03:56:49.220]   that I've managed to see on YouTube,
[03:56:49.220 --> 03:56:50.940]   and learned a lot from them.
[03:56:50.940 --> 03:56:53.820]   So education is out there,
[03:56:53.820 --> 03:56:56.900]   but it doesn't have to be as expensive as they make it.
[03:56:56.900 --> 03:56:58.180]   It's all about the individual
[03:56:58.180 --> 03:57:00.180]   and what he does with that education.
[03:57:00.180 --> 03:57:02.220]   The dream is free and the hustle is sold separately,
[03:57:02.220 --> 03:57:06.460]   is something else I would watch somewhere online,
[03:57:06.460 --> 03:57:11.060]   but the ability to take information, process it, and use it.
[03:57:11.060 --> 03:57:14.180]   We're expecting everything to be safe,
[03:57:14.180 --> 03:57:16.300]   processed, and given to us in a platter,
[03:57:16.300 --> 03:57:18.540]   and taking that and digesting it,
[03:57:18.540 --> 03:57:20.380]   and thinking that's gonna make us somebody
[03:57:20.380 --> 03:57:22.860]   that's gonna be productive or valuable in society.
[03:57:22.860 --> 03:57:25.860]   What's up to us?
[03:57:25.860 --> 03:57:27.700]   The US talks a lot about freedoms,
[03:57:27.700 --> 03:57:30.180]   but doesn't talk a lot about responsibilities.
[03:57:30.180 --> 03:57:33.820]   I think that's a big part of, take responsibility for it.
[03:57:33.820 --> 03:57:35.700]   Like I came here without anything,
[03:57:35.700 --> 03:57:37.540]   and the first thing I thought was,
[03:57:37.540 --> 03:57:41.060]   I have a responsibility for the people that I've worked with,
[03:57:41.060 --> 03:57:42.340]   and the people that are going through
[03:57:42.340 --> 03:57:44.220]   the same problems than I am,
[03:57:44.220 --> 03:57:46.780]   how can I figure out a way to help?
[03:57:46.780 --> 03:57:49.900]   - Yeah, the dark side of thinking a lot about freedom
[03:57:49.900 --> 03:57:52.820]   is thinking too individualistically,
[03:57:52.820 --> 03:57:54.100]   meaning thinking about me,
[03:57:54.100 --> 03:57:55.580]   how to optimize my situation,
[03:57:55.580 --> 03:57:58.940]   forgetting that the deepest growth
[03:57:58.940 --> 03:58:01.860]   you can do as an individual is by taking care of others,
[03:58:01.860 --> 03:58:03.820]   by helping others, by being of service,
[03:58:03.820 --> 03:58:06.220]   by being useful to your community locally,
[03:58:06.220 --> 03:58:08.580]   and then hopefully also at scale,
[03:58:08.580 --> 03:58:10.660]   and that's how you grow,
[03:58:10.660 --> 03:58:13.380]   and that's responsibility of helping those around you.
[03:58:13.380 --> 03:58:16.660]   - There's an isolationist aspect to culture now.
[03:58:16.660 --> 03:58:18.660]   It's like we are separate.
[03:58:18.660 --> 03:58:23.140]   There's almost like a spiritual or cultural amputation
[03:58:23.140 --> 03:58:27.260]   in a way where, you know, when I was a kid,
[03:58:27.260 --> 03:58:29.500]   the house where all the bikes outside of it,
[03:58:29.500 --> 03:58:32.420]   that was where all the kids were hanging out,
[03:58:32.420 --> 03:58:33.900]   and now everybody's on their phone, you know,
[03:58:33.900 --> 03:58:37.040]   in their separate houses chatting on whatever.
[03:58:37.040 --> 03:58:40.220]   There's a detachment to there.
[03:58:40.220 --> 03:58:42.300]   That's a weird aspect to it.
[03:58:42.300 --> 03:58:45.700]   And also the aspect of, I need to be safe.
[03:58:45.700 --> 03:58:47.180]   I can't be offended.
[03:58:47.180 --> 03:58:48.740]   Don't hurt me, safe spaces.
[03:58:48.740 --> 03:58:49.580]   This is my right.
[03:58:49.580 --> 03:58:50.700]   This is my right.
[03:58:50.700 --> 03:58:51.620]   This is my reality.
[03:58:51.620 --> 03:58:53.420]   You need to respect it.
[03:58:53.420 --> 03:58:55.420]   You know, respect is earned.
[03:58:55.420 --> 03:58:57.460]   And where I come from, respect is earned.
[03:58:57.460 --> 03:59:01.220]   There's freedoms, but there's dangerous freedoms.
[03:59:01.220 --> 03:59:03.780]   Any freedom you have in Mexico
[03:59:03.780 --> 03:59:06.460]   is a dangerous freedom in a way, you know?
[03:59:06.460 --> 03:59:09.100]   You can drive home drunk in Mexico.
[03:59:09.100 --> 03:59:12.140]   You can if you bribe a cop on your way there,
[03:59:12.140 --> 03:59:14.420]   and if you don't die or crash into somebody else.
[03:59:14.420 --> 03:59:17.060]   That's a dangerous aspect of freedom.
[03:59:17.060 --> 03:59:19.820]   But there's a responsibility to all of it.
[03:59:19.820 --> 03:59:23.100]   It is a twisted responsibility in a twisted way
[03:59:23.100 --> 03:59:25.020]   to kind of talk about it and describe it,
[03:59:25.020 --> 03:59:29.500]   but I think the aspect of people screaming
[03:59:29.500 --> 03:59:31.460]   for freedom up here, or their rights,
[03:59:31.460 --> 03:59:35.780]   or their privilege without the responsibility,
[03:59:35.780 --> 03:59:38.380]   you know, what are you doing for your community?
[03:59:38.380 --> 03:59:40.940]   You're complaining about this.
[03:59:40.940 --> 03:59:42.300]   What are you doing about it?
[03:59:43.500 --> 03:59:46.020]   Another thing I've noticed in traveling around,
[03:59:46.020 --> 03:59:50.300]   it's scary, is the whole people getting shouted down
[03:59:50.300 --> 03:59:53.220]   or canceled because of what they express or say.
[03:59:53.220 --> 03:59:56.860]   Some of the creepiest experiences I've had in the US
[03:59:56.860 --> 03:59:58.460]   has been through universities,
[03:59:58.460 --> 04:00:01.140]   or just seeing young people that have an opinion
[04:00:01.140 --> 04:00:03.540]   that is completely outside of reality, you know?
[04:00:03.540 --> 04:00:06.780]   People telling me how things are in Mexico
[04:00:06.780 --> 04:00:10.460]   because they learned it through a college course.
[04:00:10.460 --> 04:00:11.300]   - Yes.
[04:00:11.300 --> 04:00:16.300]   - And seeing sons of immigrants criticizing me
[04:00:16.300 --> 04:00:19.180]   because of my opinion of Mexico,
[04:00:19.180 --> 04:00:20.820]   or what I have to say about it.
[04:00:20.820 --> 04:00:24.580]   And if you wanna encounter the worst enemy of a Mexican,
[04:00:24.580 --> 04:00:27.460]   it's usually a second, third generation Mexican up here
[04:00:27.460 --> 04:00:30.580]   that shouts you down for what you're saying.
[04:00:30.580 --> 04:00:32.340]   - I mean, in general, entitlement,
[04:00:32.340 --> 04:00:33.900]   all of those kinds of things.
[04:00:33.900 --> 04:00:37.180]   Some of that comes with just being young in general,
[04:00:37.180 --> 04:00:41.660]   but yes, humility at a societal scale
[04:00:41.660 --> 04:00:44.820]   would benefit significantly, especially the young.
[04:00:44.820 --> 04:00:48.300]   So I would say some of the service that you're speaking to
[04:00:48.300 --> 04:00:51.900]   comes with being humbled.
[04:00:51.900 --> 04:00:52.740]   - Yeah.
[04:00:52.740 --> 04:00:55.740]   - And that is one of the best things you can do
[04:00:55.740 --> 04:00:58.180]   as a young person, whilst maintaining the dream
[04:00:58.180 --> 04:01:00.220]   and the ambition, humble yourself
[04:01:00.220 --> 04:01:01.820]   to the reality of the world.
[04:01:01.820 --> 04:01:02.940]   - Yeah.
[04:01:02.940 --> 04:01:05.400]   One small example, a micro example of this.
[04:01:06.420 --> 04:01:11.220]   My kid, there was a homeless guy.
[04:01:11.220 --> 04:01:16.100]   She was out with family members.
[04:01:16.100 --> 04:01:19.540]   This homeless guy showed up, he was erratic,
[04:01:19.540 --> 04:01:22.980]   mentally disturbed, created a scene.
[04:01:22.980 --> 04:01:24.540]   She was upset.
[04:01:24.540 --> 04:01:25.620]   There was a little bit of trauma there.
[04:01:25.620 --> 04:01:28.260]   She was like, "Oh, now all homeless people are bad."
[04:01:28.260 --> 04:01:33.580]   So with her, she does art pieces sometimes for me
[04:01:33.580 --> 04:01:35.260]   and helps me make designs
[04:01:35.260 --> 04:01:37.460]   for the clothing brand that I have.
[04:01:37.460 --> 04:01:38.500]   And we take some of that money
[04:01:38.500 --> 04:01:40.480]   and we buy socks and underwear.
[04:01:40.480 --> 04:01:44.180]   And sometimes I have them in the car,
[04:01:44.180 --> 04:01:46.220]   sometimes I drive around and see somebody that needs something
[04:01:46.220 --> 04:01:47.340]   and I give it to her.
[04:01:47.340 --> 04:01:49.540]   I says, "You helped me earn this money
[04:01:49.540 --> 04:01:50.900]   "that's gonna help these people.
[04:01:50.900 --> 04:01:52.740]   "So you should just give them these."
[04:01:52.740 --> 04:01:57.740]   And she's like, "Oh, thank you."
[04:01:57.740 --> 04:02:00.060]   She's like, "Yeah, cool."
[04:02:00.060 --> 04:02:01.060]   Roll up the window.
[04:02:01.060 --> 04:02:03.900]   She used to roll up the window really quick,
[04:02:03.900 --> 04:02:04.740]   now she doesn't.
[04:02:05.740 --> 04:02:08.540]   They cease to be scary
[04:02:08.540 --> 04:02:10.500]   because now some of them have names.
[04:02:10.500 --> 04:02:12.140]   Now some of them know her name
[04:02:12.140 --> 04:02:14.340]   when she crosses by there.
[04:02:14.340 --> 04:02:16.720]   So there's contact there.
[04:02:16.720 --> 04:02:19.620]   She's more connected than I am in some of these places now.
[04:02:19.620 --> 04:02:23.900]   She has friends in low places and in high places.
[04:02:23.900 --> 04:02:25.700]   That comes later, I guess.
[04:02:25.700 --> 04:02:27.860]   But she is learning about service.
[04:02:27.860 --> 04:02:31.740]   She's learning about not everybody out there
[04:02:31.740 --> 04:02:36.380]   is an enemy or bad or scary.
[04:02:36.380 --> 04:02:38.420]   She's learning about service.
[04:02:38.420 --> 04:02:40.900]   And she's basically learning that lesson
[04:02:40.900 --> 04:02:42.980]   that I got from my mom long ago.
[04:02:42.980 --> 04:02:44.980]   Nobody's against you, they're for themselves.
[04:02:44.980 --> 04:02:46.900]   Don't take anything personal.
[04:02:46.900 --> 04:02:48.660]   And if you're not doing something for other people
[04:02:48.660 --> 04:02:51.100]   while you're working, then you're not doing anything.
[04:02:51.100 --> 04:02:53.300]   - So when you were young,
[04:02:53.300 --> 04:02:57.500]   you were pretty sure you're gonna die before you're 30.
[04:02:57.500 --> 04:02:59.580]   What's your relationship with death today?
[04:02:59.580 --> 04:03:01.320]   Do you think about your mortality?
[04:03:01.320 --> 04:03:02.500]   Are you afraid of it?
[04:03:02.500 --> 04:03:03.620]   - I'm not afraid of it.
[04:03:03.620 --> 04:03:08.620]   If anything, I'm afraid of meaningless death
[04:03:08.620 --> 04:03:14.060]   or at least a meaningless walk towards it.
[04:03:14.060 --> 04:03:16.380]   I'm afraid of losing the use of my legs, I guess.
[04:03:16.380 --> 04:03:18.700]   I'm afraid of not being able to go out there
[04:03:18.700 --> 04:03:19.860]   and do things anymore.
[04:03:19.860 --> 04:03:22.540]   I'm afraid that I'm not physically capable
[04:03:22.540 --> 04:03:24.300]   of doing the job that I used to do.
[04:03:24.300 --> 04:03:28.620]   So if anything, I'm afraid of stillness.
[04:03:28.620 --> 04:03:31.040]   It's something I always quote a lot in my writing.
[04:03:31.040 --> 04:03:33.000]   Stillness is death.
[04:03:33.000 --> 04:03:35.080]   - So you always want to be challenging yourself,
[04:03:35.080 --> 04:03:37.920]   moving, growing, like you're traveling
[04:03:37.920 --> 04:03:39.440]   so you get all these experiences
[04:03:39.440 --> 04:03:41.560]   and filling your life with all these experiences.
[04:03:41.560 --> 04:03:44.840]   And if it ends, when it ends, you're ready for it.
[04:03:44.840 --> 04:03:47.120]   - Yeah, I'm not afraid of the end.
[04:03:47.120 --> 04:03:49.520]   The ending is important in all things.
[04:03:49.520 --> 04:03:50.760]   First time I got a promotion,
[04:03:50.760 --> 04:03:53.100]   I got two silver coins handed to me.
[04:03:53.100 --> 04:03:56.560]   Here's a silver coin and this is another silver coin.
[04:03:57.560 --> 04:04:00.500]   She said, "I'll give you the other one when your job ends."
[04:04:00.500 --> 04:04:04.980]   It depends on you if you wanted to have it over your eyes
[04:04:04.980 --> 04:04:07.700]   or in your pocket, right?
[04:04:07.700 --> 04:04:11.220]   And the lesson there is that this job you're getting,
[04:04:11.220 --> 04:04:12.580]   it's pretty cool and you're gonna be in charge
[04:04:12.580 --> 04:04:14.060]   of all these people and it's pretty important,
[04:04:14.060 --> 04:04:15.980]   but it's gonna end.
[04:04:15.980 --> 04:04:17.780]   So you always have to, the ending is important
[04:04:17.780 --> 04:04:18.620]   in all things.
[04:04:18.620 --> 04:04:21.180]   If we don't keep that in mind,
[04:04:21.180 --> 04:04:23.020]   then if you think we're immortal and nothing's gonna end,
[04:04:23.020 --> 04:04:25.820]   I think there's an atrophy, a spiritual atrophy in that.
[04:04:27.180 --> 04:04:29.680]   - For the sake of spiritual flourishing,
[04:04:29.680 --> 04:04:32.360]   this conversation too must come to an end.
[04:04:32.360 --> 04:04:34.000]   So I think a beautiful way to end it
[04:04:34.000 --> 04:04:35.680]   and I'm a huge fan of yours.
[04:04:35.680 --> 04:04:39.760]   Thank you for being a man with a life well lived
[04:04:39.760 --> 04:04:41.320]   and for talking with me today.
[04:04:41.320 --> 04:04:42.160]   It's an honor, man.
[04:04:42.160 --> 04:04:43.680]   It was an awesome conversation.
[04:04:43.680 --> 04:04:45.720]   - Thank you for having me on.
[04:04:45.720 --> 04:04:47.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:04:47.200 --> 04:04:48.640]   with Ed Calderon.
[04:04:48.640 --> 04:04:49.760]   To support this podcast,
[04:04:49.760 --> 04:04:52.440]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[04:04:52.440 --> 04:04:54.780]   And now let me leave you with some words
[04:04:54.780 --> 04:04:58.600]   from Al Pacino's character in Scarface, Tony Montana.
[04:04:58.600 --> 04:05:02.840]   "You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.
