[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   This may sound stupid at first, because we all think all the time. Our minds are worrying all
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.160]   the time. If anything, our problem is getting away from our own thoughts. But when I say
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.600]   "think" here, I mean something very specific. I mean giving sustained attention to potentially
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.000]   complicated or ambiguous information with the ultimate goal of building a new conceptual
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.200]   structure that has value to yourself or to the world. This is what I mean by "thinking."
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.080]   Here's the thing, most people are very bad at this brand of serious thinking. The way most
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.600]   people go through their lives is as follows. First, they outsource any sort of normative or
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.200]   ethical thinking to online tribal vibes and approval. I don't know, what does my team think?
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.160]   Do they like this? They don't like this? What's going to get me not yelled at? What's going to
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.560]   get me approved? That's about as far as I want to go trying to actually build up some sort of
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.600]   framework for understanding what I stand for, what's good and what's bad. Most people prioritize
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.280]   a sort of high-energy emotion in the moment over the subtler satisfactions of real understanding
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.400]   and appreciation. They want to just feel something, and often their phone can give them
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   that something quite easily. They don't want to do the work for actually deeply engaging with
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.320]   something beautiful. Most people also gravitate when it comes towards the realm of accomplishment,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.880]   towards checklist productivity. Just give me a list of things I can follow where the key here
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.880]   is that the information is scarce, and I have a special list of things to do, and then I'll be in
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.360]   great shape, or then my web business will take off, or then I'll make six figures per month.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.040]   Just give me checklists. I want secret information that I found online as opposed to seeking out to
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.560]   produce things that are unambiguously valuable. Serious thinkers live differently. They have a
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.720]   deep and evolving understanding of the world, what's good, what's bad, and what it means to live
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.800]   a good life. They appreciate the beautiful, they appreciate the quality, and they find inspiration
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.240]   in it. Their output is often slower, but when it does come out, it's more impact, and it engenders
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.600]   more respect. So if you're interested in the deep life, serious thinking needs to be
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.880]   a goal that you are pursuing. So here's what I want to do today is help you become a more
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.520]   serious thinker, and I want to do that in a practical way. I have five different practices.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.600]   Each of these are concrete that I want to run through. These are all things you can start
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.920]   doing right away in your own life that if you stick with them, you will find after a month,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.840]   your cognitive abilities are much better than they were before. After six months,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.760]   the experience of your day-to-day life is going to be notably different and richer,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.240]   and after a year or so, you're going to find yourself actually able to
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.800]   produce ideas for yourself and the world that have real value. Really, you're going to unlock
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.160]   major options. So it's worth becoming a serious thinker. Let's go through five practices for how
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.520]   to do it. I'm going to illustrate for those of you who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.160]   By popular demand, I will illustrate what we're doing here. So on the screen,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.960]   I'm going to put in the center my world-famous picture of a brain. So what we got here is a
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   cerebellum, and we got some wrinkles and folds in the brain. So I have a brain in the center,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   and I'm going to illustrate around this. I'll put one expertly drawn icon per practice we are going
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.880]   to discuss. All right. So the first practice that I want to discuss is to improve the quality
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.320]   and decrease the quantity of information that you consume.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:59.360]   So to illustrate this with an icon, I'm going to expertly draw here the Twitter T. I know they've
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.880]   switched to X, but I sort of am boycotting that. So I'm drawing a T, and I'm putting a circle with
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.440]   a line through it. I'm going to indicate consuming better quality and less quantity of information.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.080]   So what does this mean? I'm talking particularly here about news or other information you use to
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.600]   learn more things about the world. Stop using social media algorithms to curate your news flow.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.040]   Social media algorithms are bad curators. Their interest is not making you as informed as
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.520]   possible. Their interest is making you as engaged as possible to make you as engaged as possible.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.480]   They are going to push you to places that are not emotionally healthy. It's also not going to lead
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:44.240]   you to the most nuanced understanding of issues. I want you instead to focus on a multi-scale
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.120]   news and information consumption. So I want your news and information consumption to be divided
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   over three scales, daily, monthly, and seasonal. And here's what I mean by that. Daily
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   have a very small number, probably just one sources of quality, non-algorithmically curated
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.040]   news and information. This could be one of the growing number of daily news roundup newsletters.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.080]   I like, for example, if you're a subscriber to the New York Times, I think David Leonhardt's daily
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.840]   news summary is a fantastic one. I'm saying this mainly because they featured my profile from the
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.200]   New York Times Magazine from last year. They re-featured it recently in that newsletter.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.440]   So we know that's expertly curated. It could be a daily news roundup podcast.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.880]   It could be a physical newspaper that you pick up or have delivered. Okay. At the monthly scale,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.800]   you spend the time to go through a collection of, let's say, two to six
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.080]   in-depth long-form magazine articles. So now this is still relatively current,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   but not day-to-day current. This is now information where enough time has passed
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.320]   for a professional journalist or writer to actually spend some time to really digest
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.520]   information about what's going on in the world and produce and have edited a long-form piece.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.080]   Now we're at a lag of a month or so from what's actually going on. This is where, for example,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.640]   you can pull out a few selected articles from my own journalistic home, which is the New Yorker.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.440]   Maybe you pull out some long-form articles from the Atlantic or Foreign Affairs or the National
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.480]   Review or the Wall Street Journal's Sunday issue. Whatever it is that you particularly follow,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.440]   could be print, could be not print, tablet magazine. I'm just thinking of different
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.760]   things I've pulled from before. And you're like, "Here's my six articles I've gathered
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.360]   throughout the month, 3,000, 5,000 word beast. I'm going to go to a coffee shop somewhere. I've
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.120]   got these printed out." And let's just engage at this slower scale, deeper understanding, slower
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.480]   scale. Now we jump up to the seasonal scale, and this is books. When there's something going on in
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.360]   the world you care about, you should get a book written by an expert, someone who has spent
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   years working on this artifact based on many more years of actually engaging with this topic.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.200]   And you get this beautiful artifact here that you can hold and consume in about a week or two
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.880]   that is going to give you as deep or nuanced as an understanding of a topic as you're ever likely
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.360]   to get outside of actually studying that topic professionally yourself. So you should, at the
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.320]   seasonal scale, have a book that you're reading on whatever thing is going on in the world that
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:33.760]   is most important to you. So let's take this multi-scale information consumption plan out for
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.920]   a spin with a particular topic, and let's compare it to what most people would normally do.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.520]   Let's talk about fears about AI. Now what you could do, which is what most people do,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:51.440]   is let me read a lot of tweets and histrionic YouTube videos and short articles on the online
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   news sites. They're all like, "Oh my god, Google Gemini is doing this. ChatGPT just did that. Sam
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.560]   Altman just said this." And there's this sort of just frenzied sense of, "I'm just like very uneasy.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   I don't know what's going on, and I'm kind of stressed all the time." What would it look like
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.200]   to engage this topic with a multi-scale information consumption approach? Well, you would be getting
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.280]   daily information. When something important happened, it would be covered in whatever your
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.720]   high-quality, non-algorithmically curated source of news would be. When Sam Altman, for example,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.840]   got fired and then rehired, David Leonhardt's newsletter covered that. So you would get the
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.480]   main points. You're subscribed to Axios's daily news roundup. You would get the main points.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.640]   Then on the seasonal scale, you could actually say, "Let me sit down with, for example,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.480]   the New Yorker's recent AI issue and read some of these longer form pieces. Let me sit down and
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:49.680]   listen to..." Ezra Klein had a fantastic AI podcast recently with Kevin Roos and Casey Newhoff, I
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.560]   think. "Let's spend an hour and 20 minutes just walking through what we know. Maybe you go back
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.320]   and finally read my New Yorker piece on the guts of how Chats GPT actually works. This is not so
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.960]   frenzied. This is more digested information." "Okay, I'm getting some deeper sense of what's
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:12.000]   going on." On the scale of a season, you say, "I'm going to read a book about artificial
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.720]   intelligence, maybe about the alignment problem or how people are thinking about its role in
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.160]   society and now get a really measured, deeper understanding of it." That is how multiscale
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.640]   information consumption works. Serious thinkers are going to consume information that way.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.360]   They have no interest for algorithmically curated social media information.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   The same thing, though, applies, I'm going to say this, in improvement of quality,
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.160]   decreasing of quantity. We can think of this also applying to other types of information
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.400]   as well. Think about shows or movies you watch on streaming services. To increase the quality of
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:56.960]   that, simple heuristic, one-to-one ratio, fun smart. If I watch a movie that is just pure fun,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.240]   I want to watch something that's going to challenge me, either artistically,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.400]   this is a well-respected movie, or informationally, it's a documentary on something that's
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.600]   complicated, but I want to know about it. One-to-one ratio, so that the quality of what
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.040]   you're engaging in the streaming media gets better. You can do the same thing with podcasts.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.720]   Here's a fun podcast, one-to-one ratio with something that I'm learning from, etc.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:29.600]   Practice number two, increase your comfort with boredom. Let's draw a picture for this one as
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:38.000]   well. What I'm going to draw here is a rock. All right, there we go. Sitting on this rock,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.240]   we see someone contemplating. Jesse appreciates my artwork. Increase comfort with boredom.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.640]   What is the idea here before we get even more specific about the practices?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:58.160]   If your brain is used to this idea that it is never bored, that when it lacks novel stimuli,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.400]   you will always feed it a shiny digital treat in the form typically of your phone,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.320]   or an iPad, or a browser tab that's going to give you something emotionally salient.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:13.040]   In the moment, it can't tolerate serious thinking. Because serious thinking requires you to keep your
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.480]   attention sustained, this inner eye of your attention sustained on a single abstract topic.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.400]   That's boring, because there's not a lot of novel stimuli. Your brain has to be comfort with boredom.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.880]   So by increasing your comfort with boredom, you're just teaching your brain it's not that
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.440]   you're bored all the time. It's also not trying to put too much of a positive value on boredom.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.600]   It's just teaching your brain sometimes we're bored and sometimes we're not, and I'm comfortable
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:45.360]   with that state of boredom. So how can you do this? Two things I'm going to suggest.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.440]   One, actually have every day a particular outing, or chore, or task you do. It can be short,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.360]   but a particular thing you do without your phone. Go to the drugstore, go put in your laundry. It
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.840]   doesn't have to be long. Taking out the garbage and do it with nothing in your ear. So you're
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.520]   like, okay, I'm just doing this activity. There's no novel stimuli here. I'm just kind of having to
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.000]   be alone with my own thoughts. A lot of people who take this advice will also typically add a
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   longer outing on the weekends, hour plus, no phone. You can ramp that up over the weekend.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.800]   The other really important thing you can do is the phone foyer method. The idea here is when
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.480]   you're at your home or your apartment or wherever you live, you keep your phone plugged in in one
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.320]   place. If you have a house with a foyer, it's in the foyer or it's in the kitchen. If you have an
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.720]   apartment, whatever, but it stays plugged in when you're at home in one place. If you need to look
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.600]   something up, you go to where it's plugged in and you look it up there. If you need to receive or
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.880]   text with someone, you go where the phone is plugged in and you receive and do text there.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:52.080]   Same with phone calls. You have to go to where the phone is. It is not where you are. Now,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.720]   this is going to be annoying at first, but what you're doing here is severing this permanent
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.880]   accessibility of the distraction. So now when you're watching something or doing something
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.920]   in your own house or in your own apartment, you can't pull out the phone. It's somewhere else.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.920]   You still have the benefits of ID to look this thing up, but you have to walk 10 feet to go do
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.880]   it. You're going to get more many moments of boredom during your evenings and mornings at home.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.000]   Very important if you want to prepare your brain to be a serious thinker.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.880]   All right. Third thing I want to suggest here, third practice for becoming a more serious thinker,
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   cultivate your ability to pay attention. So illustrate this here.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.600]   You won't know at first what this means. So provocatively, what I'm drawing here
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:50.240]   is a stopwatch. Is there something on the top, Jesse? I don't know. Let's do this.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.600]   Perfect rendition of a stopwatch. Why am I drawing a stopwatch? Because one of the first things I'm
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:02.400]   going to recommend for cultivating your ability to pay attention is interval training. So actually
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.280]   increasing the timed intervals at which you're comfortable giving sustained attention to a single
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:15.200]   target. These intervals should be intense. You only increase the time of the intervals as you
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:21.360]   get comfortable with the current duration, right? So what we're trying to do here is get your mind
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.840]   comfortable with sustaining attention. So the previous practice, getting a comfort for boredom,
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.760]   we think of that as the table stakes, the foundation. Your mind has to be okay with
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.880]   not having a lot of stimuli. This practice now about focusing and practicing the actual activity
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.400]   of focus, the actual activity of sustaining attention. So you have to be able to do it,
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.920]   and then you have to actually practice what this actually feels like. So with interval training,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.560]   you can do this with multiple activities. It could be a difficult work or school activity.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.600]   It can also be, and I think this is critical, a high quality leisure activity, like watching a
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.920]   movie, which a lot of people, especially young people right now have a very hard time doing for
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.840]   more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time without actually looking at their phone. It's gonna be
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.880]   a high quality leisure activity or a difficult work activity. It could be reading a book, even
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.240]   anything that requires focus. You start with an interval that you're comfortable with,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.160]   keep it small at first, maybe even just 10 minutes, you use a real timer,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.880]   set that timer, and might as well do it on your phone, by the way, because you want your phone
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.360]   right there in timer mode. So you know for a fact if you use your phone, because you've left the
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.280]   timer mode on your phone, set the timer for 10 minutes and work on that work task, watch that
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.840]   movie or read that book with as much concentration as you can muster, zero checks of anything
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:51.440]   screened outside of your target until that timer goes off. If you break that concentration,
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.520]   I just have to check Twitter. I just have to see what's going on my text messages. You have to
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.400]   start that timer and start it over. It doesn't count. Once you're able to consistently hit the
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.200]   current time duration, you increase it by 10 minutes. So this is just literally training
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.080]   the thing you want to be better at, sustaining attention on cognitive tasks, the absence of
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.560]   stimuli, sustaining the attention. You got to train your brain what that feels like.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.600]   Okay, another thing you can do when it comes to cultivating your ability to pay attention is more
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:32.880]   passive, which is care about ritual, care about environment. Set up, this is where I go to read.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.040]   And it's different than where I just sit and work or watch TV. I've set up like a very special chair
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:45.360]   and I have this light here and it's by like a warm radiator in the winter. This is where I go to work
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.720]   on deep work challenges versus just regular work or email. I have a separate part of my house. I
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.640]   went up to the attic and I've renovated an eve there and that's where I go to do deep work.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.400]   And it's different than where I do my email and where the printer and all the filing cabinets are.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:05.200]   I have a ritual I do before I watch a hard movie. I do a thing to get my mind into that mode. I
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.720]   listen to a movie podcast while walking for 20 minutes. Ritual and environment will help you
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:17.360]   fall into that deeper attention mode. Combine that with interval training. All right, let's go to our,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:26.560]   let's look at my list here. Let's go to our fourth idea to help you become a serious thinker,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:33.600]   our fourth practice, I should say. And this is going to be strengthen your working memory.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.920]   So I'm going to draw here is a person very determinedly walking,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.480]   because he loves my art. And this person is thinking about all sorts of things.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.320]   Why am I drawing a person walking? Because my number one tip for increasing your working
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.600]   memory is productive meditation. It's an idea that goes all the way back to my 2016 book,
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.320]   Deep Work. With productive meditation, you take a professional problem,
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   or it could be a complicated personal problem, but a clear complicated problem.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.200]   You go for a walk, and you try to make progress on that problem only using your head. The walking
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.720]   helps you do this. If you're just sitting and thinking it's much more difficult, but the walking
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.200]   actually quiet some noises in your cognitive circuit. So it's a little bit easier to focus.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.360]   And every time you notice your attention wander away from the problem that you're trying to make
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.440]   progress on in your head, you notice that wandering and you move your attention back
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.720]   to the problem. This forces you to get very comfortable holding lots of information in
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.960]   your head and trying to manipulate it and generate new information based on it.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.640]   You can make these walks longer and longer as you get more comfortable with this exercise.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.120]   This is directly increasing your working memory strength.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   Your working memory strength is critical to being a serious thinker. Serious thinking requires you
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.560]   to pull multiple pieces of information and hold onto them in your mind's eye.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.440]   This piece, but also this piece and this piece is over here. And how do these things relate?
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.680]   And then how do I connect that to this other thing I thought before?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.080]   Working memory is at the core of deep thoughts. Most people have a bad working memory, however,
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.440]   because we're not used to holding a lot of stuff in our head in a way that we can actually access
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.560]   them with our mind's eye. Productive meditation is direct and intense practice for exactly this
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.480]   problem. It gets exactly to the heart of what you're trying to do here.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:34.240]   All right, we got one more practice to help you become a serious thinker. I'll draw one more
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:41.520]   picture. So this final practice, I'm going to say it this way, practice being intellectual.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.640]   And so let's see, let's draw our stick figure person here. So how do we know this person is
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.920]   intellectual? Oh, it's not going to work. I'm going to draw him in a turtleneck, but he needs
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.680]   a neck, Jesse. That's the problem. So let me give him a neck. My stick figure person, there we go.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.080]   Give him a big neck. - Your French accent.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.560]   - I probably will give him a beret as well. - And a pipe.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:12.320]   - Yeah, so there you go. Turtleneck, because he's an intellectual. All right. Beret,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:22.480]   because he's an intellectual. And a pipe. There you go. Practice being an intellectual. Now,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.120]   I joke by drawing this picture of like sort of a pretentious Frenchman with a pipe,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.040]   because intellectual is often used in modern conversation as a pejorative term, but there's
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.560]   also a very specific and positive meaning here. It's a stance towards the world of information
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.440]   in which you are seeking out nuance and subtlety. You're also seeking out integration of information
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.880]   into complex understandings that you already have. So to be an intellectual is that you are
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.400]   engaging with the world of information, trying to master it and integrate it.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.560]   Now, if you do this for a living, like I do, if you're a professor,
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.760]   they teach you how to do this. I mean, this is what you do for a living, but we don't talk enough
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   about everyone else. How do you practice this intellectual stance, an intellectual approach
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.600]   to the world of information? I'm going to give you two very concrete ideas that I think almost
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.040]   anyone can do. And it's going to make you literally seem much smarter. The first is
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.840]   pairing primary and secondary sources. Pairing secondary and primary sources. Okay. Here's what
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.520]   this means. It's most obvious with books. So you want to read a great book. Let's say I want to
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:43.760]   read The Odyssey. I want to read Joyce. I want to read Epsilon Epsilon. The typical approach that I
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.320]   think professional intellectuals have, which is flawed because they forgot their own training,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.640]   is they say, just read it. Just expose yourself to the ideas and then pretend like it's really
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.440]   changed your life. But that's not actually the way you learn how to engage information and draw
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.920]   out nuance and complicate it. What you should do instead is say, okay, let me now get, before I
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.680]   read this hard book, a secondary source. A secondary source means it's a book about the book.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:20.880]   So here is a book about why Faulkner is important or why Epsilon Epsilon is important. Here is a
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:28.320]   book about the heroic Greek world in which Homer wrote The Odyssey and why this is such an important
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.840]   book. I'm going to read about the book first and then go and read the actual primary source itself.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:41.200]   You are now approaching this primary artifact with a framework for how to understand it,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.920]   what you're looking for, what's important about it. And this gives your brain practice
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.600]   seeing things at a new level. You might not understand everything you saw in a secondary
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.280]   source and you might not come away saying, I completely understand this book or it's changed
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:59.760]   my life, but you've practiced reading multiple layers below the surface. See, when we just tell
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.400]   people, read the great books, go to the museums, and you'll just be inspired. We really are selling
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.560]   them short because that experience of inspiration requires you seeing multiple layers below the
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.240]   surface. And you got to practice that. Secondary sources first. Same thing with museums. I do not
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.720]   like this idea when parents have of like, all that's important is that we expose our child to
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.960]   art museums and then they'll love art. They're not going to come away from that loving art. What
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.000]   you're really just teaching them is how to be comfortable in the social context of an art museum.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.360]   So they'll seem cultured if they're around other people. Staring at paintings does not make you
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:43.520]   a lover of paintings. Reading about those paintings, who was this artist? Why was this
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.760]   important? What was happening before when this artist came along? What was the historical context
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.080]   or turmoil created by this painting? And then you go and see the artifact, you have a completely
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.840]   different relationship with it. So you could teach kids even, let me give you some basic
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.920]   information. Who was Jackson Pollock? What was going on with the abstract expressionist? What
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.080]   were they fighting against? Why was this so exciting if you lived in Soho in 1942? What
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.800]   was happening here? And then you see this artifact and it's a different experience.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.240]   It's like when you go to the Smithsonian and see Judy Garland's Ruby Slippers, what's exciting about
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.400]   the Ruby Slippers is not just they're shiny, but it's like those were the things in Wizard of Oz.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.360]   That was a really important movie and this famous person wore them. That context helps.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.680]   So you get in the habit of doing this. You can do it with art, you can do it with books,
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:40.560]   you can do it with movies. I do this all the time. Let me read five reviews about this movie.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.560]   Not like contemporary, but people looking back, it's a great movie. People looking back and
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:52.640]   writing essays about this movie. Roger Ebert did a lot of this. Later on, he went back and wrote
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.520]   this series of essays about the great movies. The Guardian over in the UK does a lot of this.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.760]   They'll write these retrospective essays about movies that might be decades earlier.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.520]   And then you go and watch the movie. It's a completely different experience.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.480]   It could be modern movies, it could be older movies. You read about, for example,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   center focusing, and then you watch George Miller's Mad Max Fury Road. It's a completely
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.240]   different experience and appreciation when you just put the movie on without that type
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.000]   of knowledge about the cinematography. Secondary sources paired with primary sources. This is what
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.320]   academics do during their training. They read and write their own secondary sources based on
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   these primary sources. So it becomes second nature, seeing levels below the surface on all
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   sorts of things. But if you're not going to a doctorate program, you're not getting this training,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.400]   you have to do it yourself. It really makes your intellectual world a lot more interesting.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.480]   Here's the other thing I want to recommend for practicing being intellectual.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:54.240]   Maintain idea documents. These are actual documents you maintain like a Microsoft Word file,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.400]   just in your own personal files, or if you're a good handwriter, you could do this in journals.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:05.760]   And you have particular topics that you are recording and updating a summary in your own
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:12.560]   words of your best understanding of that topic. Now, these can be just general, timeless topics.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.480]   Like I'm interested in Stoic philosophy, and I have this document I build out and add to about
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.640]   what Stoic philosophy is, who the thinkers are, what their major thoughts are, your current
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.880]   summary of how you're thinking about Stoicism being in your own life. You are, through writing,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.240]   consolidating information, structuring information. Now, again, this is something that real
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.720]   intellectuals get good at doing naturally, but you have to practice it. So writing and
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.480]   updating these summaries is a good way of doing it. You can do the same thing with current event
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.160]   topics as well. There's something going on in the world that you care about. I don't know,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.680]   this scares me or interests me, or just it feels important to me. Create and begin
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:02.320]   maintaining a document of how you feel about this and why. This is a fantastic way to free yourself
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:08.560]   from the emotional ping pong game of just let me expose myself to social media or algorithmic
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.040]   content. Let me choose a tribe and make that tribe make me feel good or scared and help me get mad
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.120]   about the other tribe. It gets you out of that trap and allows you to begin building your own
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   understanding of things. You're worried about AI. Start building out this document. Here's what's
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.680]   going on. Here's the main types of AI. Here's where things are. Here's a list of thinkers
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.200]   and where they stand. And this thinker is against this thinker. You organize your thoughts.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:37.760]   You're really worried or upset or conflicted or uneasy about conflict in the Middle East.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.080]   Build out a document. Shut down Twitter. Build out a document. Here's what's going on. I mean,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.080]   this is why I'm trying to articulate my concerns here. I really worry about this,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.240]   but this, I don't know how this is making me feel bad as well. And there's this argument
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.520]   doesn't quite work. And here's why you're talking about arguments and where it falls
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.400]   short for you, where it resonates. Build idea documents as a way of structuring to write is to
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:05.440]   think. So the right about what matters is to help you think about what matters and your brain gets
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.240]   used to organizing information in the conceptual structures. So actually I have to practice being
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.800]   an intellectual. All right. So if you do these five things, all of which I've beautifully illustrated
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.360]   here, you begin, uh, improving the, the quality and decreasing the quantity of the information
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:28.080]   that you consume. You get comfort, uh, comfort with boredom. You do interval training for just
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   maintaining your concentration. You do particular training, the strength in your working memory,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.600]   and you actually practice engaging information as an intellectual. You can become a much more
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.320]   serious thinker. It's not something you just choose to do. It's not something you're just
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.640]   born to do or not. It's something you cultivate. And hopefully if you're a listener of the show,
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.800]   you do agree that this is worth cultivating because I think it is, you see someone who's
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   doing something cool. They're probably a serious thinker. You see someone who's done really well
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.080]   for themselves. They probably have the way to do serious thought. And in this case, maybe it's
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.680]   applied to a business issue, a strategy, but there's serious thought going on there. You see
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.200]   someone who just has a really interesting, engaged life. They're probably a serious thinker. They
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   appreciate this. They can go to the movies and, and love the experience. They have things they're
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.200]   deeply engaged in. Your brain is your number one portal to the world. And if you train that brain
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.440]   to be a serious thinker, your experience of the world changes the technicolor, the font gets
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:32.720]   smaller. The, uh, clarity gets much increased. It's just a different sort of improved experience
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.120]   with life. So train it, train that thinking, and you will get better at it. I'm struggling
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.240]   to be social and confident. What can I do to speak more articulately and gain confidence
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.560]   and impress more people? Well, Tanya, it's a good question. And I can tell you a lot of this
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.800]   is practice, right? The more you're around people in different situations, the more comfortable
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.680]   you get in those situations. The more you spend talking about things or explaining yourself or
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.640]   talking to people, the more comfortable and articulate you get in those types of conversations.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.800]   I mean, I talk pretty, you know, here on this podcast, but in part, because I've been
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.000]   professionally speaking since I was in my young 20s. So I'm sort of used to it. The cadences of
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.760]   speaking, the pacing, the coming up in your head with what you're going to say next, it all just
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.840]   sort of comes with practice. So social stuff really can be practiced. You can start with very low key
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.600]   social stuff early on stuff that you're already pretty comfortable with. I know this person,
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:35.280]   I don't mind hanging out with them. So we go to, you know, a restaurant or a bar together or go to
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.200]   movies together on a fairly regular basis. I'm just used to in a comfortable situation,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.440]   being out in the world with people and talking to them and interacting, but the stakes are low.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:49.360]   Then you can build that up to bigger things. Okay, I'm going to go to bigger social events
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.440]   or parties at first, you know, small ones. Here's my friend, that's their birthday party,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.400]   and you get more confident with that. So a lot of this is just practice.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.800]   Now, one of the things I think that is often left out of this conversation is the role of anxiety.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:09.120]   Anxiety gets really intertwined with socializing in ways that I think it's hard for people who
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.560]   don't feel that same anxiety to understand. They don't understand how these really get
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.240]   mixed in together. You really can start to build up a sort of dread or anxiety around
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:26.480]   different situations. It's why one of the outcomes of pretty severe anxiety disorders would be an
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.920]   agoraphobia where you don't leave your house anymore. It's because often those two things can
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.760]   go together. The same circuits that are related to sociality are often the same circuits that
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.200]   are short-circuiting when you're suffering from anxiety. So if anxiety is a real issue here,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.040]   Tanya, it's not just, "Oh, I'm out of practice. What do I do?" It's, "I really feel physically
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:54.560]   dread and concern and panic when I'm in these situations." I would look towards ACT, ACT-based
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.000]   techniques. They're very good for exactly this situation. So ACT, otherwise known as third wave
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.160]   psychotherapy, stands for acceptance commitment therapy. It's a very effective evidence-based
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:13.680]   type of psychotherapy that does really well with anxiety, social anxiety, panic-type anxiety around
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.320]   other people. It's really based upon separating feelings from your actual actions. It really
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   helps train you to recognize the physical symptoms of something like anxiety and say, "Yes, but I'm
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.600]   still going to commit to do this thing that I think is valuable, and I can still do that even
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.720]   if this feeling comes and goes." It helps you avoid labeling that feeling as, "This is really
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.880]   important. Something really bad is happening. It's really bad to be feeling this way." It breaks that
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:48.000]   loop of you labeling your feelings and just seeing them as feelings themselves. We talked about this
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   a little bit in last week's episode. We read Marcus Aurelius' meditation. He had some actually
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.120]   stoic ideas that are connected to modern acceptance commitment therapy. But I just want to point that
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.440]   out there, Tanya, that there's a more serious training you can do with the tools of ACT
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:09.120]   that are there and available. And so if the anxiety is really holding you back,
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.840]   that's not permanent. You have to think about that like knee pain. You had knee pain. The
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.280]   doctor's going to help you fix it, though it might take some PT and a little bit of time.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.520]   Same thing here. Look into acceptance commitment therapy. There's some good books on it.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.160]   I think it's The Happiness Trap is one of the famous public-facing books on ACT. That's a
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.600]   good entry place into it. Harris, Russ Harris, maybe. You can look that up, Jesse. It's The
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.520]   Happiness Trap. But I just want to throw that out there because it can be frustrating if you're on
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.520]   the anxiety spectrum. I'm on that spectrum. It manifests for myself in interesting ways. I have
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.040]   to do a lot of training on it. Depending if you're on that spectrum, it can be frustrating to just be
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.040]   around someone really social. It's like, what's the problem? Just come to the thing. What could
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.440]   go on? And they don't realize that you're feeling immense dread. So there's a lot of things you can
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.880]   do there, Tonya, that train. Do the work. It is worth it. Sociality is very important.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.920]   Yeah, you got it right. It was Russ Harris.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   Russ Harris, OK. The Happiness Trap.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.160]   Yep.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.280]   Yeah, it's a good book. All right, what do we got next?
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.640]   All right, next question is from Ben. In what ways can being ordinary be good in life?
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.520]   This was an interesting question, Ben. I had to think about it a little bit. It resonated a little
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:27.280]   bit because I think what you're getting at here is this interesting trade-off when you're thinking
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.440]   about the deep life and how you want to shape it. Because one way you can go, of course, is towards
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.880]   exceptionalness. I want to do something exceptional. I want to be noted for it. I
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.200]   want to do something noteworthy, have some fame for this thing that I'm doing that's important.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.600]   That's one particular path for the deep life. The other path for the deep life is I want to
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:54.080]   build a life around my values, start with discipline, figure out my values, organize my stuff,
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.560]   sacrifice and be a leader on behalf of others, and then find areas of my life to be remarkable.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.880]   And you could sort of have this quiet, deep life where you really matter to a lot of people
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.840]   and you find and extract out of life a lot of joy and appreciation of stuff that's fantastic
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.360]   or great or remarkable, all without having to be I am an exceptional X and people recognize it.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.640]   You have sort of two paths towards depth here. There's kind of pros and cons of each,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.800]   especially when we look at that exceptionality path, right? Because there's good there and we
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.640]   shouldn't turn down the good. Why do people want to try to be great at things? Well, first of all,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.960]   you do gain more autonomy, right? You do something really well. There's more demand for it. You often
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.160]   gain more financial reward and or more control over how you live your life. There are several
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.080]   things I do at a pretty high level, and I do have a lot of flexibility in my life. We get to mess
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:50.320]   around in this playhouse, deep work HQ. You know, I go away in the summers. I have very high control
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.880]   over my schedule. I don't worry about money, really. That's not really an issue. So there's
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.840]   great autonomy that comes from doing some things really well. Also, it feels good to be respected
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.480]   in the moment. We're wired for that. This is the whole tribal leadership thing. We tell ourselves
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.320]   it doesn't matter, but there is ego. And you do feel if something goes really well, you'll feel
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.560]   good about that for a while. There's a reason why people chase it. That is the stimulus that is
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.800]   perverted when we see workaholism, right? So with an addiction, there's usually some sort of very
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:26.240]   powerful stimulus that becomes the driver for the addiction, the feeling of intoxication, right?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:33.200]   Workaholism is really that feeling of, wow, I did this thing well, and people recognize that my boss
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.560]   rewarded me. That's a very strong stimulus. That's why you can build a whole addiction around it.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.840]   On the flip side, though, it can be very stressful and anxiety-producing to try to do something
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.600]   exceptionally well. It's hard to do. And it puts you into bigger, more stressful circumstances you
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.080]   have to navigate. You get more people, perhaps, who want your time than you have nearly enough
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.520]   time to actually give. And you have to start saying no to people, and people think that you're
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:02.080]   being snobby or elitist. High-stake things are just anxiety-producing. And you have to figure,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:07.280]   is this worth the anxiety? Is this one not? Things can fall apart. It's hard to do things at a high
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.880]   level. So there's negatives that come with it. I mean, I constantly have to make these decisions.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:16.960]   There's television things I've turned down, for example, that may be in isolation. You say,
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.080]   well, that's cool. I know that show. That would be really cool to go on. And it's like,
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.400]   I can't do all of these things. And if I did, it's going to overwhelm me with time
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:29.040]   constraints and anxiety. I have to be careful about how I make my path. So it's tricky.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.400]   So I think it's a really good question, Ben. If you're going the route of, let me just be
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.200]   exceptional, you can build depth around that. And there are some real positives you're going to get,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.600]   but there's also negatives. And I say that because I think that then when you get the scale between
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:51.520]   the quiet remarkability approach versus the exceptional, notable, famous remarkability
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.080]   approach, when you put the cons with the pros on this ladder, the scales become about balanced.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.440]   And so you really, if you're going the quiet remarkability approach, a life that,
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:09.680]   you know, it's Lorelei Gilmore and the Gilmore Girls, not famous outside of Stars Hollow,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   not like exceptional at anything, but in that world, you know, is really well known and has
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.680]   built this really interesting life. And people really know her and appreciate her. And she's
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.880]   involved in people's lives and having a positive impact on that town. But she's not famous outside
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.800]   of that small little town. That's quiet remarkability. Not so bad of a path. And again,
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.920]   I don't want to say the other path, the sort of exceptional remarkability is bad. I'm just saying
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.360]   when you have the pros and the cons, it's no longer like, well, this is clearly better if you
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.960]   have the skill, you know, you have the whatever, I can shoot a really good jump shot. I could go
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:46.640]   that way. If you have the possibility to go that way, it's not bad, but it's also not a no brainer.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   And if you don't see an obvious way to get to the exceptional remarkability,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.200]   you shouldn't feel bad about it. Because again, these things balance out.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.320]   Steph Curry versus Lorelei Gilmore, that old famous comparison, like there's,
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:05.040]   I don't know, there's pluses and minuses to both. So neither should be dismissive of the other.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:10.400]   That's a weird comparison. I might be the first person in history to make that particular
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:17.600]   comparison. Probably. I mean, I can't imagine it's come up in the locker room, you know,
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.440]   the NBA finals stuff, man, this is your, it's your Lorelei moment, buddy.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:27.120]   This is it. You got to just get out there. I want you to man up and Lorelei this. All right. I mean,
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:33.440]   you gotta, uh, your dribbling should be like the fast speech cadence of Lorelei Gilmore,
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.840]   confusing people with, as you move back and forth verbally through various things.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.640]   And this is the Kirk of your town, but you need to get the ball to Luke.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:48.080]   And it's probably some basketball strategy metaphor. The end of that speech would be like,
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.800]   hold on one second. Someone's handing me a piece of paper and oh yeah, I'm fired.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.760]   And then the coach just walks out. That's how that story ends. Like, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.320]   And I was fired. All right. Nonsense. Stop the nonsense. Let's move on. What do we got next?
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.800]   All right. Great. Next question is from Samantha. How important are having friends in life?
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.680]   If it is important, how would you recommend an introvert go about finding some? Also,
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.240]   can you provide some advice on moving on from certain friendships that could be holding someone
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:20.800]   back? So this is a good compliment to Tanya's questions about being more social and confident
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.080]   friends. As I mentioned, there are critically important. And for a friendship to be real,
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.480]   it has to involve non-trivial sacrifice of time and attention. Otherwise your brain doesn't treat
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.320]   it as real. So just texting someone all the time doesn't count. Commenting on their social media
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:42.400]   doesn't count. Being active in a WhatsApp channel with them also does not count as far as your brain
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   is concerned. They're not a friend until you're going places and doing things with them, doing
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.440]   things you might not otherwise want to do, but you're doing it because they're your friend.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:55.120]   That's when your brain begins to take the relationship seriously. So this should be a
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.520]   regular part of your weekly planning, especially if you're trying to build up friendships as
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.040]   something that's more important than a regular part of your weekly planning should be. What am
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.880]   I doing this week to strengthen or develop friendships? You have to be pretty systematic
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.680]   about it, especially if you're sort of getting back in the saddle, so to speak.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:18.480]   So fortunately, I can point you towards a resource here. There was a segment we did a few episodes
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.040]   back on this notion of the friendship recession, this idea that Americans in particular have less
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.480]   friends than ever before. It's a segment where I had my friend Jamie Kilstein come on and talk about
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.800]   what he went through to gain a new group of friends in his 40s as a male, where this is
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.280]   kind of difficult. So we got into the weeds in that episode about specific things you can do
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.800]   to actually find and cultivate friends. So I won't repeat that all, but I will say find that segment
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:52.400]   on the friendship recession. That was a final segment on a relatively recent episode. Maybe
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:58.560]   Jesse knows whenever Jamie's on, I begin just furiously messing up their names.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:06.880]   And as Jesse has pointed out, maybe it's because Joe Rogan's podcast producer is named Jamie. So
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.440]   it's just in the collective conscious of like, Jamie is what you call the other person on a
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.320]   microphone when you're podcasting. So it doesn't take much to tip me into that. He'll look that up.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   But anyways, I think- It was 266.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.600]   266. Take control of your technology habits.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.520]   Right. Episode 266, deeplife.com/listen. You'll find that and then the video for it's there as
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.360]   well. So look at that discussion with Jamie, because I think this is critically important,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.520]   especially if you do not have a robust group of friends. Think about that like getting in shape.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.160]   It's going to require a lot of work on a regular basis with some tried and true tactics, but it is
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:47.760]   absolutely worth doing. Friction can be a real problem. Notetaking, I think, is one of those
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:55.200]   cases. When information is coming at you, your time to act, your energy to think,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.240]   both are probably pretty limited. So if I have a relatively complicated system, I have to boot up
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.320]   and start using markup code to take this article I just randomly came across and enter into my
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.000]   system and cross-reference it with the right Zettelkasten categorization system. So it will
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.720]   semantically link to other related articles. I'm probably just going to say, forget about it.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.080]   That friction stops me from taking action. Or if I have friction over something I need to do,
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.000]   like reading a book, I have an elaborate way of how I'm going to copy every note from this book
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.600]   into my system, I might not just read that book because I only have so much energy for reading,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.280]   and I might be taxing every last bit of energy I have just to tackle this book.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.040]   You make that 20% harder, I might not just read the book. Or I'll read it and say,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.960]   forget it. I'm not taking notes on everything, and that information then is lost.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.080]   So when it comes to actually capturing information from all the stuff that's out there,
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:59.920]   unlike say writing a long New Yorker piece, friction is a problem. So you want your note-taking
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.640]   systems to lower that friction so that you can actually capture effectively as much of
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:12.080]   the important information as is possible. Another problem with elaborate systems is that they often
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:19.440]   aim to take everything out of your brain. It should be in this external system. The system
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.480]   will organize the information. You don't have to remember anything. When you want to know about
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:30.320]   something, you can dive down in the system and it will unearth for you everything you've encountered
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.200]   that's relevant to it. I actually think when it comes to the big things in your life, be it big
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:42.320]   work projects or be it things about just the way you live, keeping some of this in your brain is
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.920]   not a bad thing. Because what your brain is doing with this information is updating its internal
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:54.160]   schemas that it used to make sense of the world. And if information is useful, if it's in your brain,
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:58.000]   it's going to get integrated into these systems. And then when you apply these systems to try to
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.240]   make decisions, you'll remember this information or at least some of it, "Okay, this is relevant
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.720]   to me. This idea sticks." In other words, when it comes to big ideas and important information,
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:13.440]   you want your brain to be part of the curation filtering system. You remember, "Yeah, this book,
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.760]   it stuck with me. It had these examples I remember were really important for X." Now,
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.160]   you might have to still go to your notes to see what those examples are.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:29.280]   But the fact that your brain remembered that book was important, that I think is crucial.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.840]   We don't want to outsource everything out of our brain. We want it to be involved in filtering and
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:39.120]   prioritizing, curating, and trying to make sense of information in the background. Simple systems
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:45.680]   allow that because they're not trying to capture everything relevant to the information you come
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.520]   across. All right, so let's actually talk about my systems. I'm going to break this up into three
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.200]   sections. The first, let's deal with books. I read a lot of books. Hopefully, you read a fair
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.760]   amount of books as well. There is information in books that's relevant to your work. There's
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:08.000]   information in books that's relevant to your life. The last episode, we had a big, long thing about
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.920]   how to actually encounter self-help information of various levels of quality that's important.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:18.400]   How do you take notes on books? Well, I'm going to show you my method. I'm going to draw here.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.080]   Jesse will bring up, for those who are watching, if you're listening, go to thedeeplife.com/listen
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:30.880]   episode 287. The video will be at the bottom. I'm going to draw a picture of a book page here,
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.920]   Jesse, so I can show you. We'll pretend like this is a real book page.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.240]   Then, I'll take some sample notes on it. I'm putting some words on here.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.480]   The method I use for taking notes on books, I call it the corner marking method.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:51.200]   It is as low friction as you can possibly make note-taking on books, while still actually being
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.880]   useful. Here's what I do. If there's something on this page, like the page you see here,
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.280]   that is interesting to me or I want to remember, first thing I do is I mark the corner like this.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.160]   Just mark a line across the corner. Now, I know if I'm flipping through this book,
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.480]   that that page has something important on it. What do I then do with the information on this page
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:22.240]   that is actually, I want to remember? Simple marks in the margins. I might, for example,
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:30.080]   put a little box. Let's see here. I might put a little bit of a box around text that's important,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.720]   or I might just put a little bit of a check mark next to a line, or I might put a curly brace next
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:40.480]   to a paragraph that I want to remember. Just small marks in the margins to indicate what lines
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.200]   are important. Occasionally, I might scribble a little note to myself as well, if there's a
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.800]   particular thing that reminds me of. That's it. This barely slows you down as you're going through
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.200]   a book. Mark, mark, mark. You'll see me. I'll have a pencil in my teeth as I'm reading. I'll
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:01.360]   pull it out. Mark, mark, mark. That's all it is. So it barely slows you down. But here's the
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.360]   reality of the corner marking method. If you go back to that book way later, so it's out of your
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.680]   working memory. It's a year later. It's five years later. I've done this before. And you start going
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.600]   through that book, looking for the pages that are marked in the corner, and then reading the
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.480]   sentences or paragraphs that have been marked in the margins, you will, in about five minutes,
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:28.160]   reconstitute all the important ideas from that book. So it's a very effective way of capturing
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.720]   that information. It's not in some fancy system where it'll automatically show you all the quotes,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.800]   but you get to them almost as fast. It takes a little bit longer to go through the book,
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:42.320]   but the information is there. So the low friction here is important because it doesn't
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.040]   prevent you from reading. In other words, if the effort required to read, you're just there
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.000]   in terms of what you have available, corner marking note-taking barely changes that effort.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.840]   So it's not going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. You'll still read that book.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:00.240]   On the other hand, it is still going to be effective for getting the information you need.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.480]   The one shortcoming, which I don't think is really a shortcoming at all, is that you still
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:10.080]   have to remember, oh, that book, vaguely speaking, had some important ideas about X.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.360]   So later when you need some important ideas about X, you do have to remember to go back to that book
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.200]   and then use the corner marking to very quickly hone in on where those ideas are.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.040]   But as I mentioned before, that's not a problem.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:27.760]   I want you to have to try to remember that book is useful. If you don't, it probably wasn't that
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:33.040]   useful. And remembering that book is useful allows you to then, and I do this all the time,
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.400]   even without remembering the specific quotes, use the gist of what I learned from that book
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.000]   in the schemas of knowledge that I'm constructing and modifying and growing in my head.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.120]   So that's not really a bug, but a feature. You do have to remember some about what's in what book,
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.320]   but you can do that. You'll become a better reader. You'll become better at remembering
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.840]   and connecting books without having to reference your system. And when you need the specific
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.240]   examples, this very simple system will get you there very fast. All right, so that's the part one.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:10.000]   Part two, projects. Now, typically what I'm thinking here is professional projects,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.120]   but we'll see this can apply to personal projects as well. So think about my life.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:22.720]   I write books. I write articles for popular press, like magazines. I write academic articles.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:29.280]   All right. Where do I keep notes relevant to these things? It's like I have a book that maybe
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.080]   is due in three years. I'm not going to start writing it for another year.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.400]   I come across a podcast interview, and I'm like, ah, this is relevant to that book. Where do I put
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:47.040]   this? Where is my magic system that I put it? My approach is to store notes relevant to projects
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.480]   in the location where you will one day work on that project.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.920]   So for example, I write my popular press articles using Scrivener.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:01.760]   So if I have an idea for an article, I'll create a Scrivener document for it. If I come across an
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:08.160]   article or a link or even just a brainstorm that is relevant to that article, I will go to the
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:13.360]   Scrivener project for that article. I will go to the research folder for that particular article.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:21.280]   I will add it right there. I write my books in Scrivener. So I'll have a Scrivener project for
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.360]   a book, be it a book that I've already been paid to write or a book I haven't even pitched yet,
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.080]   but I'm thinking I might one day want to write. And as I have ideas, I go to the research folder
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.720]   in the Scrivener project for that book. That's where I put it. Then when it finally comes time
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.200]   to work more seriously on an article or a book, everything potentially relevant that I've come
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:44.160]   across is right there, ready for me to use it. Low friction. I'm not gathering it. I'm not
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.040]   navigating a system and hoping to encounter interesting ideas. I'm not hoping my system
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.520]   is going to write the book for me. Hey, just give me all the ideas. No, no, no. Ideas are hard.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.920]   You have to think really hard about what's going to make sense. The information needs going to be
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:04.080]   there when you get there. It's not an elegant system. An article might find its way to a couple
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:09.760]   different projects, but it works. Same thing for my academic articles. So as a theoretical computer
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:15.920]   scientist, my papers are largely mathematical. So we write them using a rendering engine called
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:23.200]   LaTeX, L-A-T-E-X. Any scientist knows about this. I use software for it called Overleaf. It's web
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.640]   based software for writing these articles because it's collaborative. So my collaborators and I can
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:33.200]   write at the same time. I just put relevant notes for potential papers, create an Overleaf project,
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:39.040]   start adding sections and subsections. Any ideas or notes I have about that project goes right into
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.600]   the document. And then when it comes time to write that paper, we start adding sections to the
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.760]   beginning of this document, pulling stuff from later on. And at some point when the paper takes
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:53.040]   shape, we hide all the notes and we're left with just the polished paper. You can do the same thing
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:58.400]   for personal projects. Wherever you plan a project, and this could be just like a folder in
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:03.760]   Google Drive, that's where you should go and put the inspiration pictures, the ideas, the
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.720]   recommendations for contractors. Put the notes immediately into the place where you're going to
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:15.920]   one day do the work. Big believer in that for making effective use. And bonus, there's always
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:23.600]   a bonus to all these approaches. The bonus here is that every time you come across something new
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:29.920]   for one of these projects, I come across a link that's relevant for an article. When I go to add
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.880]   it to the Scrivener research folder for that article, I encounter again and again, everything
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:40.160]   else I've already found. And that refreshes a mental picture of that project in my head and
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.640]   my head can do some more background processing. You know when some of the best ideas for my books
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.400]   or articles come, like six hours after I add something new to the research folder, because it
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.040]   loaded all that stuff up again. My mind was like, "Oh yeah, I forgot about that." And then it's
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.280]   thinking about it and some new cool angle comes up and now you're rock and rolling and you get
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.040]   a real insight. So I think it's an effective system, but minimal friction. It's the easiest
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:09.840]   possible thing. Load, type it in, out. All right, final thing. What about ideas about your life?
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.320]   Big ideas about living a more meaningful, sustainable, deep life.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:21.760]   I'm inspired by what I saw in this movie. Maybe I should get really into this particular hobby.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.400]   Where do you store ideas not connected to work or projects, but to your own life?
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:31.920]   Here, I think you should have an awesome notebook. This is where having a notebook
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:38.480]   that's actual form is cool and aspirational and just interesting to you is I think important.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:44.400]   This is where having a really cool pen is really important. So all of that fetish that surrounds
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.120]   note-taking and systems, most of that is not applicable to your work. It can't keep up with
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.680]   the volume of stuff relevant in your work. You can bullet journal until your fingers bleed.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:00.160]   You're not going to keep up with working on six New Yorker articles and three academic articles
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:05.680]   in a book per year. There's probably 400 or 500, maybe 1,000 different notes to get taken for that.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.360]   You're not going to keep up in your paper notebook with that. But your life, you can. Ideas about your
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:18.000]   life, you can keep up with in a physical notebook. That's where you want the cool one. That's where
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.560]   you want the form of the notebook to matter. For a long time, I used Moleskins. Long-time
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:29.360]   listeners know this. Earlier this year, I switched over to a Remarkable. So it's a digital notebook,
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   which I really love. Again, it's ridiculous because it's like $500 or something. It's stupid.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:39.760]   Um, but I love it because I have like 15 different digital notebooks in there now,
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.800]   and I could just go to any of them at any time. And I really love the technology. We
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.360]   did a whole thing about it on the show. Uh, but whatever the point is, it's cool and aspirational.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.920]   To me, it's interesting. That's where you have your cool notebook for keeping track of ideas
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:58.320]   about your life. And all you need there is some sort of semi-regular process of reading through
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.120]   these. The very simplest thing you can do if you're using a physical notebook is when you fill it,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:11.280]   put aside an hour to review it, and to only copy into your new notebook, short summaries of the
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:17.520]   most important or lasting ideas from your previous notebook. So there's a very natural triage you can
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:26.080]   do that way. See what sticks, uh, and what you lose interest in over time. So that's my approach.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:33.200]   It is low friction. It is simple. Very little custom software is required. One cool notebook
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.760]   and whatever else you're already using for your work, but because you're adding very little
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.720]   friction, you can keep up and the stuff that matters will get captured and put to the place
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.040]   where it matters. And then of course you get all the bonuses. So again, for books, the bonus is
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:53.200]   having to remember which book had, what is a feature, not a bug. It allows you to continue
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   to work with and build on these ideas after you first encounter them. When it comes to your
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.760]   projects, having your notes where you want to actually do the work is not just efficient,
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:07.280]   but it allows you to re-encounter the gestalt of what you know about that project again and again,
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:13.280]   as you grow those notes, allowing your mind to work more with it. And cool notebooks put you
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:19.600]   into that mindset of a cultivator or crafter of your own life. So we're sort of hacking the brain
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.960]   here. We want the brain to be involved in the process of dealing with information, but in ways
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.360]   that doesn't overload it or overtax it. So that's my system. It's not as exciting as other systems.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:38.800]   Some other systems, people actually make this clear disclaimer, like building systems and that's
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.440]   fine. I mean, if that's like your hobby, I think that's fine. If you like building the complicated
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:47.760]   system because you get enjoyment in the system, you might actually take more notes because you
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.440]   really love the use this cool system you built. It's like when you build a pool and you customize
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:58.240]   it, you really want to have a lot of pool parties, right? So I get that. But if that doesn't appeal
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.120]   to you, don't worry. You do not need a super complicated system, but you do need something.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.520]   So this is my suggestion. At least that's one place to start. It doesn't really give us Jesse,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.320]   like a complicated software package we can sell. That's the only problem.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.040]   - On our new Shopify store. - Yeah. Our new Shopify store
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:19.360]   is going to have like a Moleskine, a Uniball micro pin for marking like the corners of book pages
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:27.840]   and like a Scrivener subscription. I don't know. It's not as fun. I, you know, I would,
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.160]   I could rabbit hole on that stuff pretty hard if I wanted to. Like note-taking systems, you know,
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.840]   I could get going down there. Hey, if you liked this video, I think you'll really like this one
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.440]   as well. Check it out.
