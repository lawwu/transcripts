[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   [Music]
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.800]   Satan is a prowling lion, an enemy of ours who is right now seeking to devour Christians.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.440]   But can we be devoured? Yikes! Or are we safe?
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.320]   And what does that mean anyways? And how can we find shelter for such an unseen threat to our eternal security?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.600]   John Piper addressed this important question straight away in his 1994 sermon on 1 Peter chapter 5. Here's what he said.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.360]   Here's another question. Can Christians be devoured?
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.760]   Verse 8 says, "Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.480]   The word is to swallow whole, like the fish did Jonah. Same word in Jonah and Septuagint.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.720]   Your adversary the devil wants to just make you disappear, vanish. You're out of here. You're gone. You're going with him to the lake of fire. That's what devour means.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.200]   The question is, can that happen to me and you?
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.640]   Verse 9 says, "Resist him." And the reason you're to resist him is because he's trying to devour you.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.800]   He's trying to devour you. Resist him. Is that a charade? It's war games. They're blanks.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.120]   They're all blanks. There are no bullets in the gun. Nobody gets killed in this game.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.640]   It's just, just resist him because, just do it.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.320]   Nothing's really going to happen if you don't because it doesn't happen to Christians.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   Is that right? Well, I think the devouring is real and it sure sounds serious to me when Peter says, "Resist him. Resist him."
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.760]   Doesn't it sound like a game? Sounds like heaven and hell are at stake here to me.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:14.160]   So I ask again, can true born-again Christians possibly be devoured by the devil?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   And the answer is, no. Because true born-again Christians always fight. They fight.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.960]   That's what it means to be a true born-again Christian.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.520]   True born-again Christians have the Holy Spirit within them so that when they see the lion coming, they don't say, "Ah, nothing's at stake here.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.000]   I don't need to fight. I don't need to stir up my faith. I don't need to read the Bible. I don't need to pray.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.280]   I don't need to be with other believers. I don't need to be vigilant over my eyes and make sure that flesh doesn't get the upper hand because nothing's at stake here."
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.480]   True born-again believers do not talk like that.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.560]   True born-again believers have the Holy Spirit inside who embraces the Word of God that he inspired.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.760]   They hear the word, "Resist him now. Fight because your life depends on it. I'll give you the success, but you fight."
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.880]   And they fight. If you don't fight, you're probably not born again.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:22.480]   At least if you go on and on and on and on, slipping away from the vigilance of faith and fighting sin and the devil,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720]   you've got no reason to think you're saved.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   It doesn't really matter what you prayed a long time ago. It doesn't matter what card you signed.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.280]   It doesn't matter if it's baptism. It doesn't matter what your parents did.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.560]   Salvation is real. It's real. It's real. It's the work of God in a human heart.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.880]   And there are effects from it. And one of the effects is when the lion comes, you fight.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.360]   There's a promise in this passage which is just staggering.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.120]   It's in this passage. It's also way back in chapter 1. In chapter 1, verse 5, it says that Christians are kept,
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:12.800]   precious word, kept by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.760]   Through faith. Through resisting the devil firm in your faith.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.880]   If you say, "I'm kept. I'm kept by the power of God."
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.280]   And you don't resist him firm in your faith, you're contradicting God.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.000]   God says, "I'm going to keep you. I'm going to keep you by my power through your faith against the devil."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.200]   And you say, "I'll take that, but I won't believe."
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:48.880]   It's like I go into a king's hall, this great king in some enchanted empire, and he takes the ring off his finger.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:05:00.240]   And he puts the ring on my finger and he says, "Sir John, as long as you wear this ring, you will be invincible."
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.160]   I say, "I'll be invincible?" "You will be invincible." I write that down. "I will be invincible."
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.120]   And I walk out, I take the ring off and I sell it, pocket the money, and I say, "I'm invincible!"
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.760]   He said, I got it written here, "You will be invincible."
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.840]   There's something wrong with that. It's something wrong with hearing God say,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   "You are kept by my power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed."
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:36.240]   And then say, "I'm kept by his power. And if Satan comes, I don't need to fight by faith because I'm safe."
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.200]   It's like taking off your ring.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.120]   Now God will not let the elect, born of God, called, take off their ring.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.920]   The evidence that you are a child of God is that you keep the ring on.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.320]   The badge, the badge of the children of God is battle.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.480]   The badge of the children of God is battle against sin and the devil, not perfection.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.280]   That badge, that crown, that comes later.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.520]   But the fight, I will fight. I will not lay down my shield.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.080]   I will not take off my ring. I will not rip off my badge.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.760]   I'm a believer and he will keep me safe through faith that he himself works in me.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.840]   That is a classic Piper clip on the theme of perseverance through means.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.440]   And it's a clip that comes from his 1994 sermon titled, "The Dominion Belongs to the God of All Grace."
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.560]   A sermon on 1 Peter 5, 8 to 14.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.440]   The entire audio can be found online at DesiringGod.org free of charge right now.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   It was sent in to us by Brian Hughes in Houston, Texas.
