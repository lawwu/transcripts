[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   Here's your host, Jake. Hi, it's Jake here. Welcome to The Voluntary Life. This is part
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.120]   two of an interview with Joshua Sheets, who is the host of the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.560]   Joshua and I are discussing how to think about tax, both for entrepreneurs and employees,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.200]   and for anyone interested in gaining more financial freedom. In the first part of the
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.440]   interview, we talked mainly about employees. And in this episode, we go on to talk about tax and
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.760]   entrepreneurs. So here's part two of the interview. We talked a while there about issues relating to
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.480]   employees and thoughts about using tax-deferred accounts as an employee. But you did say that
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.200]   you had some thoughts about the tax strategy and entrepreneurs. And I wanted to give you a chance
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.160]   to share any thoughts that you have about that. I really appreciate what you're saying about the
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.640]   opportunities for entrepreneurship in terms of wealth creation. I totally agree with that. I
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.320]   mean, there are definitely limits to what you can do as an employee. And although entrepreneurship
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.000]   is a lot scarier for some people to consider, it's the opportunity for generating wealth that
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560]   has way, way more power than being an employee. But there is a question of tax too. So what are
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.920]   your thoughts about tax strategy for entrepreneurs? So let's go back to the three strategies. And this
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.320]   is a direct way of answering it as far as the timing strategy. So we talked about deferring
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.760]   income or accelerating income as the first example of a timing strategy. And one strategy for
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.320]   employees in doing that is to be able to use retirement accounts. But there's another concept
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.000]   of timing, which is deferring deductions or accelerating deductions. And this is one of the
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.120]   unique things that's primarily available to entrepreneurs. As an entrepreneur, you have the
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.320]   ability to take business deductions and to either bring them forward under limitations in each
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.520]   country that are different, but to bring them forward or push them out. And this can have a
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.920]   substantial impact on the amount of tax that you're paying. So best example here would be
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.960]   something like buying advertising. You may be in a business that is going to be well-served by
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.360]   purchasing advertising space of some kind. Well, you can get to December. You can sit down in the
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.000]   beginning or middle of December and you can figure out, let's say that you know that for every dollar
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.320]   you spend in advertising, it has a return of $2 of profit to your company in the future because
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.360]   you figured out a way to satisfactorily invest the money in advertising and has an actual return.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.320]   You can sit down in December and you can look at the amount of profit that your company has
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.600]   for the year. And you can say, "Well, do we need to go ahead and take some of this profit out now?
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.560]   Or should we go ahead and expend some of this money on investing into our company? And so,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.960]   could we benefit from the deduction being available in this tax year or would we benefit from the
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.280]   deduction in the next tax year?" And you might find that in December, you look and you say,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.840]   "We don't need the money now, but we'll go ahead and we'll just plow the profits right back into
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.320]   advertising because we know that means next year we're going to have a much bigger customer base
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   and much more income." Or you might decide to do the opposite. But the point is you can control
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.440]   your deductions. This is the biggest benefit of entrepreneurship is the ability to take deductions
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.960]   and to take some of your costs and turn them into deductions. That's a timing strategy.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.520]   Now, the next two are also useful with regard to entrepreneurship. The next one is income shifting.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.040]   And in an income shifting scenario, we're trying to shift income from a high-rate taxpayer to a
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.720]   low-rate taxpayer. And so, there are ways where we can shift income from parents who are earning
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.600]   income at a high tax rate to children who are earning income at a low tax rate. You need to
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.960]   be careful. In the United States, we have certain rules on tax doctrines, one of them, the assignment
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.440]   of income doctrine. There's also kiddie taxes and things like that. That'll vary within jurisdictions.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.160]   But you can look to say, "Can I shift some of the income from the high tax rate parent to the low
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   tax rate child?" You can also shift income between a business and you as a business owner. And this
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.120]   will go back and forth both ways depending on the business entity. In the U.S., you can have a
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   business structure that's taxed as a separate entity from the owner. And you can also have an
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.640]   owner taxed as the same entity as the business. And so, in some cases, depending on the type of
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.960]   tax that you're planning for, you'll wanna go ahead and have the tax flow through the business
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   to the business owner. On the flip side, in some other cases, you'll wanna go ahead and have the
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.760]   income taxed first at the business level, at the entity level, and then flow through to the
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.080]   business owner. And you can also shift income between counties, between states, and between
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.800]   countries. And let me go with the third one and then I'm gonna apply a bunch of these examples
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.920]   of 'cause the most powerful benefits is when you stack them. And you can stack them as a business
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.320]   owner. The third and final strategy. So, we've got timing was the first one, income shifting was the
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.760]   second one, and conversion is the third one where we convert income from a high rate activity to a
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.720]   low rate activity. And so, there are a few different aspects of this. One of them would be
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.480]   changing the structure of compensation from our business from wages, which are usually taxed at
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.680]   the highest rate, to dividends, which are usually taxed at a lower rate. Or by converting some type
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.000]   of personal expense that would generally be a non-deductible personal expense into a business
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.280]   expense. And you can use the simplest, most straightforward example or the most exotic
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.920]   example. I'll give you an exotic example first. Let's say that I have a real passion for racing
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.680]   expensive race cars. And this is a real, something I really love doing. So, I'm gonna buy an expensive
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.000]   racing car and I'm gonna go to the track and I've got all this gear that's associated with it.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.160]   Well, if I'm a high income earner and I have a high tax rate and I'm in a high income tax rate,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.560]   let's say that I expend $150,000 a year on my hobby. Well, under this scenario, I have to earn
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.760]   much more than $150,000 a year. Let's say that I have to earn $200,000 a year, pay $50,000 of tax
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.280]   to be able to spend $150,000 on my personal hobby. The simplest thing that I would do would be to
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.440]   convert that personal hobby into a business. Now, you have to do this appropriately and you have to
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   run it as a business. As long as you're running any business like a business, and there'll be
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.480]   rules that'll vary in different countries, but in the US, that's the key thing. You have to run it
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.280]   in a business-like manner. Then you can convert all or the majority of those expenses into business
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.200]   expenses. So, if I'm running a racing team as a profit-seeking enterprise, now the cost of the
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.160]   racing car, instead of it being a personal hobby that I'm out running just out of my own personal
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.360]   checkbook, becomes simply equipment for the racing team. Now, my trips, instead of being personally
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.600]   paid trips to the racetrack, become a key component of the business expense. Now, the mechanic,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.480]   instead of my having to hire the mechanic out of my personal pocketbook, that mechanic's wages
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.920]   become a business expense. Now, if I want to go ahead and if I make money on my racing, which
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.160]   hopefully I can do that, and there are many ways to do that, but I might even make money on my
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.320]   racing and I might turn that hobby into a business. So, that's kind of the rich boy toy perspective,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.720]   but that's exactly what wealthy people throughout the world do, is they always do something out of
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.600]   their business entity. Now, you need to be very careful to separate personal enjoyment and
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.400]   personal expenses from business expenses. If you're going to take the family on a personal trip in
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.200]   your private airplane, that must not be deducted as a business expense. But if you're taking a
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.400]   business trip in your private airplane, that is a business expense. That's at the rich boy or rich
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   girl level. What about at the simpler level? Well, I run a podcast. And so, what that means is I have
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.720]   to invest in a certain amount of business equipment. So, I have a microphone, I have a computer,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.600]   I have a certain amount of business equipment. I enjoy traveling and I like going to conferences.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.280]   Well, what I do is I go to a conference and I take my podcast equipment and I record interviews
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.520]   while I'm there at that conference. And so, if I come over to London and there's some fascinating,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   well, maybe it's some fascinating Bitcoin conference and I'm going to go and interview
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.000]   the global leaders of Bitcoin and I'm going to be there in London, I've now turned that trip
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.200]   into a business deduction. There are a number of careful rules that I need to follow. But as long
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   as I follow the rules, I can convert a certain amount of those personal expenses into a business
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.080]   deduction. So, that can save me, depending on my tax bracket, we've established that there's a 15%
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.920]   employment tax rate. And if I'm in a 20% personal income tax rate, that can be a savings of say 35%.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:28.080]   And if you expand this out and you think about the fact, I mean, did Peter Jackson, when he's
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.960]   filming Lord of the Rings in New Zealand, did he pay for all of his travel expenses to New Zealand
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.160]   out of his personal pocketbook or out of his movie production company pocketbook? Those are all
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.640]   business expenses. But did he have no fun filming that movie? Of course he had fun. And that's the
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.360]   power of entrepreneurship because when you start to stack these things together, and let's say that
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.160]   in here would be just, I like to use extreme examples to illustrate the point. But, so right
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:03.760]   now, my show is primarily crowdfunded and it's essentially crowdfunded through a Patreon campaign,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.760]   which at the moment, without any advertising, I'm in the process of bringing advertisers on,
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.800]   but without any advertisers, it nets me after business expenses, somewhere on the range of say
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.600]   $1,500 a month. Now, if we were to use something like the rule of thumb that we use in financial
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.440]   planning, and we were to say, how much capital would I need in the bank to be financially
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.040]   independent with a 4% safe withdrawal rate at $1,500 a month? 1,500 times 12 for 12 months is
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:36.720]   $18,000. And divide that by 0.04, and we wind up with, I would need $450,000 of capital in the
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.400]   bank. Now, there's a big difference between having a passive portfolio of investments, paying me
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.760]   dividends to live on, versus having an active income. But I'm pursuing a lifestyle business
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.440]   that I would do even if I were fully financially independent. So, in my mind, there's not that big
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.160]   of a difference because my business is location independent. It allows me to teach, which I love
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.440]   to do. It allows me to meet all kinds of interesting people and gives me the personal gratification of
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.040]   being able to help people. And I love getting those emails. And whether or not I'm financially
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.840]   independent, I don't buy into this whole, I'm lazy and I sit around and do nothing idea. To me,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.520]   that sounds like depression guaranteed. So, I like the work that I do. So, if I look at it from the
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:24.160]   perspective of the monthly profit from this little hobby business is $1,500 a month, I basically
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:31.200]   created a $450,000 asset for myself just simply based upon the work over the last year. I've
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.640]   built a $450,000 asset, but that asset is fully tax deferred and it's never taxed because there's
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.600]   no actual value to the company. That's just what I'm equating it to. Now, compound that with a
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.800]   timing strategy. I've invested a lot of money now and I'm deferring profits to the future.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   I invested a lot of the money during the years that I had a high income. So, that allowed me to
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.480]   bring forward some of my business deductions up front, which lowered my overall tax bill.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.920]   I am also converting some of my activities that I'm interested in regardless into business
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.040]   activities. So, now if I go to a conference that I would go to anyway, it's not just a personal
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   conference. I'm pulling a business use out of it and I can build in other businesses. So, now if I
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.920]   want to pursue a location independent travel lifestyle, I can go ahead and build that.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.600]   And then at some point, who knows, maybe I'll change my tax jurisdiction. I'll get tired of
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.040]   US tax law being as confiscatory as it is and I'll say, "I might move to a country that values me as
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.920]   an entrepreneur a little bit more than they value me as a taxpayer." And so, now I've built this
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.440]   revenue that's coming from a global basis and at some point, I could convert that. Excuse me,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.840]   I could shift it from a high tax rate country to a low tax rate country. And so, here I'm
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.560]   converting instead of earning wages, I'm building value and dividends. I'm shifting it from one tax
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.760]   jurisdiction to another and I've accelerated my deductions in the years that I needed them
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.720]   in order to create a lifestyle business. And there's a certain component of my personal expenses
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   that are now going to be properly allocated over to a business checkbook because I'm pursuing a
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   business that I love. I can't do all that stuff just simply working as an employee at one company
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.320]   in one place. Absolutely. I think that's a really helpful example. There's a lot of useful content
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.200]   that you've shared there. And I think the two points that really come out for me as number one
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.120]   is that if you compare your opportunity as an employee and as an entrepreneur, as an employee,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.360]   your tax strategy, I mean, it's kind of a one-trick pony basically. You've got the timing
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.080]   question of do you put your money into a retirement account or do you take the tax now and put it in
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.400]   to tax-exempt savings? And again, those accounts in the UK, there's a limit on how much you're
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.080]   allowed to put into those each year too. So, as an employee, there are strategies but they're
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:52.320]   very limited. And what you've just described, Joshua, is that as an entrepreneur, you just have
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:59.520]   way more options for looking intelligently at how to minimize your taxes exactly within the law,
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   but taking into account all the different ways that you can adjust what you're doing in order
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.840]   to have a really efficient tax strategy. And so, there's just way, way more opportunity to do so,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.160]   as well as generating way more value in the process. The one thing I would say about it
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.520]   though, the second thing that comes to mind is that I think everything that you're saying is
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.960]   absolutely true and great for entrepreneurs. There is a difference between a lifestyle business and
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.280]   a startup that is being built with the intention to sell in the end. And a lifestyle business in
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:36.080]   the way that you describe it, you can really go crazy with making full use of all these different
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:43.440]   opportunities to create an enjoyable life for yourself using your business in that way. And
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.600]   some of those strategies won't really be applicable if you're building a business for
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   sale because in the future, people who want to buy your business, they're going to want to see
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:59.120]   that you have generated an efficient money-making machine. This is where sometimes the opportunity
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.440]   to reduce tax can actually warp your business strategy a bit and lead you to do things that
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.920]   might not necessarily be in the interest of somebody who would want to buy the business
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   in future. It's not an issue for you and what you're doing because you're building a lifestyle
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.960]   business and you're having a great time doing it. But I think for entrepreneurs who are developing
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.200]   a company where they actually want to sell it in future, it's a little harder to use some of those
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:31.120]   kind of opportunities. What do you think? You're exactly right. The thing that makes my show and
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.880]   my advice different than I think many other shows and many other people who deliver advice
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   is I do my best to point out all sides of a situation because in financial planning,
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.840]   there is always another side and that is a very important point that you just made.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.800]   There are two aspects that I've seen that a number of times. Number one is in the sale of a company
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.440]   and if you have a company that you believe you're going to be able to sell as an entity,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.920]   it's very important that you are maximizing the value of it. In fact, that's probably one of your
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.480]   best ways to places to invest is to do the things that are going to make your business extremely
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.200]   attractive and that business is going to be judged based upon its profitability.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.520]   So, you are absolutely right. My business at the moment, there's no sale potential. It's purely
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.160]   built around me and my brand and I don't see any potential of it being sold as a going concern of
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.440]   any kind at the moment. That doesn't mean I won't spin off businesses from it that will have that
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.760]   opportunity but at the moment, I've chosen lifestyle business first. The other flip side is
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.200]   even if you are running a business, it's a lifestyle business, there's always going to be a
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.800]   trade-off. It's the simple one. Many entrepreneurs are very good at lowering their taxable income
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.360]   and then they go to apply for a mortgage and find out that, wait a second, what they did to lower
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.800]   their taxable income didn't help their ability to qualify for a mortgage or I sold a lot of
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.480]   disability insurance in years past. Same exact thing. "Well, Joshua, I'm making $150,000 a year."
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.760]   Yeah, but your tax return says that you're making $50,000 a year and so you're only going to
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:08.080]   qualify for disability insurance based upon the $50,000 a year instead of the $100,000 plus.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.840]   So, there are problems to that but the key thing is as an entrepreneur, you can actually control
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.800]   that. And so, if you know, "Okay, I'm building this business and I think my goal is to sell it
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.000]   in about five years." Well, five years of high profitability is going to get you where you need
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.960]   to go. And so, you actually have control whereas an employee, you don't. Yeah, absolutely. And it
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.480]   all depends on what you're looking for because there's nothing wrong with choosing to create
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.920]   a business that's a lifestyle business and totally making the most of that. And there's nothing wrong
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.200]   with deciding that what you're creating is a startup and that what you're aiming for is
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.120]   something that you can actually exit from. It's just, I think, with tax strategy as with all of
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.800]   these other things, you got to be aware of what you're doing and aware of what the consequences
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.000]   are going to be if you make certain decisions that might down the line impact on your ability
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.520]   to achieve your end goal, whatever that is. And for any individual, it's going to depend on their
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.320]   own preferences and how they see the opportunities in their particular marketplace. But the key point
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   that you're making, Joshua, remains that you just have way, way more opportunity as an entrepreneur
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.960]   to look strategically at your situation and work out how to generate the most value with the minimum
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   tax. And I don't think you can possibly get that kind of opportunity from the position of being an
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.600]   employee. This is one of the great benefits of entrepreneurship is that it opens you up to
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.720]   actually a lot more independence and a lot more opportunity to create value while still being
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.800]   really tax efficient. Could I add a few ideas that might be helpful to employees? Those three
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   strategies, we've specifically focused on applying them to income tax. So timing, shifting, and
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.720]   conversion are applied to income tax, but they can also be conceptually applied to every other type
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:04.560]   of tax. And so my encouragement to employees would be to not just focus on income, do everything you
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.400]   can to control your income tax, but also look at some of the other taxes that you pay. And these
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:16.720]   will vary across jurisdictions, but let me give you some simple examples. Most of us will have some
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:24.160]   form of sales tax that we pay. Have you ever looked through and tried to figure out how much you're
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.560]   actually paying in sales tax? If you do that, and then you ask yourself, "How can I avoid the sales
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.600]   tax?" You'll be able to save yourself a substantial amount of money. Perhaps this would result in, for
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.440]   example, in the US and Florida where I live, we have a 6% sales tax on packaged food, you pay the
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.520]   sales tax. On groceries that aren't packaged food, you don't. So if you just simply make some simple,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.160]   careful selections on your groceries, you can avoid much of the sales tax on the food. But if you
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:59.280]   start buying primarily packaged foods, there's a 6% additional cost for that. Or you can try to defer
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.480]   that. So for example, we have a store here that the store credit card gives an automatic 5% rebate.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.320]   So anything we buy at that store credit card gets the 5% rebate. In my mind, that helps me if I'm
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   going to buy packaged goods from that store versus the other store, that will help me to avoid most
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.680]   of the sales tax that I'm going to pay on packaged goods. Little things like that done over time add
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.840]   up. Another example would be something like real estate taxes. And so the county that I live in is
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.760]   a county called Palm Beach County. And in Palm Beach County, we have a higher tax rate on houses
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.400]   that we own. Comes out to be about 2% of the assessed property value. The county immediately
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.520]   to the north of me has a lower tax rate. It's called Martin County. They have a half the tax
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.440]   rate. What basically 1% of the assessed value of the property annually in property taxes.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.600]   Now, I could move up there and I could save money on property taxes. And that might be a good
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.840]   decision depending on my scenario. Or I could live in Palm Beach County and I could pay the higher
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.200]   property tax rate. Here was how I made the decision. When I was formerly, I bought a house that's
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.280]   about four-tenths of a mile from my office where I maintained my financial planning practice.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:18.480]   And one reason for that is because I'm able to deduct on my income taxes the cost of interest
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.960]   on my home mortgage under US tax law and also the cost of real estate tax. So I'm able to deduct
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.200]   those things against my income tax. But I'm not able to deduct any kind of commuting expenses,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.320]   whether I'm a business owner or not. Even as a business owner, I have to drive to my place of
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.480]   work and then anything from that will be business mileage. But anything between my house and my
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.640]   place of business is not. It's commuting expenses. So for me, if I were to live farther north,
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.720]   I would have much higher commuting expenses, many more miles on the car, plus the cost of the time
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.840]   sitting in the car. And yes, I would have lower real estate taxes, but that would be offset with
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.480]   higher gas costs, higher fuel maintenance costs, not having to replace my vehicle more frequently,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:13.920]   etc. Whereas if I just simply move closer to my office, I do pay more for the house such that I
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.400]   do have a higher mortgage balance. But the interest on that higher mortgage payment is a deductible
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:24.080]   expense and I'm paying higher real estate taxes, but those are deductible. So I'm able to leverage
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   and this is actually a shifting strategy or conversion strategy depending, but I'm shifting
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.480]   some expense from the commuting category, which is non-deductible expenses over to real estate tax
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:43.120]   and mortgage tax, which are deductible expenses. So each individual type of tax that we pay has a
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.000]   strategy. As an employee, you might look and say, "You know what? I'm getting to the point where I'm
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.840]   earning some pretty decent income. Let me go to my employer and see if they will offer me some type
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.200]   of partnership arrangement where instead of constantly increasing my income in wages, which
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.400]   are going to be the highest tax, maybe I can negotiate a small share of interest of ownership
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.280]   and I can start to be receiving some dividends from the business instead of wages." So don't just
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.520]   set it aside because you're an employee. You will be more limited in your ability to use business
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.840]   deductions and use these strategies on income, but income taxes are only one component of your
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.080]   total tax bill and each type of tax will have a different strategy that can be applied to its
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.440]   planning. If you buy all your stuff secondhand and you avoid the income tax, excuse me, the sales tax
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.120]   on that, if you go back and you look at that over the course of time, that might have a substantial
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   difference on your total expenditure given over time and that might mean the difference to being
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.680]   financially independent a year sooner when you look out over a 10 or 15 year plan. I think
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.080]   that's great and I just want to say for people listening to what you're saying, Joshua, because
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:00.400]   these are really helpful ideas and also you've mentioned a ton of useful things to think about
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.560]   and what I think would be really useful to take from it is also to come back to the point that
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.240]   you made at the beginning, which is that a lot of people are looking at tax from the perspective of
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.400]   almost total unawareness and not really even thinking about it. The one thing that I'd really
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.040]   like people to get out of this is not necessarily that they have to understand or implement every
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.680]   single one of these ideas because there's loads of content there for people to think about.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.040]   The key thing I want people to get out of it is just to really be conscious about the opportunity
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.080]   to minimize your tax and think about how much tax you're paying. Try and be more aware of it
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   so that you're going to be open to noticing opportunities to be more intelligent about your
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.400]   approach towards different tax strategies and that's really what I think is the starting point
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.160]   that will give people a much better approach because if you are more aware of it and if you're
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.800]   being more conscious of it then you're going to be more open-minded about really understanding
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.640]   some of these suggestions that you're making, Joshua. I think that's really helpful for people
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.560]   who have heard the suggestions that you've got. I really appreciate you sharing your expertise.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:15.360]   For sure and the final thought I would leave with people is, unless you have anything else,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:22.080]   final thought I would leave is you cannot view tax planning as the one big thing. There's a
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.720]   statistic that I like to cite that I read in one of my tax books that in the United States
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:34.160]   there are basically about 20,000 people who make in excess of I think it was $200,000 and pay zero
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   federal income taxes on their money and there are a thousand people who make in excess of
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.600]   a million dollars and pay zero federal income tax on their money. That's in the lead in and
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.280]   there was an IRS statistic, our taxing agency statistic which was in the preface of one of
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.520]   the tax books that I have and that statistic has fascinated me for years because and when I tell
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.960]   it to people the first question they ask is, "How do you do that?" and what I looked for for years
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.440]   and what many people look for is they're looking for the one thing. Well, it might exist but I
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.840]   haven't found it yet. I've never found the one thing that makes a difference with tax planning
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:19.360]   but I've found many, many, many little things that might be able to be applied in your specific
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.600]   situation. So that statistic was in the preface to a book that was I think a 700 page very meaty book
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.920]   on tax planning strategies. The key is by starting with an awareness of your actual situation which
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.760]   is where when I teach people to make income statements, I teach them to start with their
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.520]   gross income meaning all of their income before every single tax and every single deduction
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.000]   and to put on there every single expense including all the ones that are on their paycheck or
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.080]   including all the ones that are getting pulled out of their business if they're just running
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:56.720]   things through their business. Put every expense on there. Then individually, you as an individual,
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.360]   you don't need me, you can sit down and you can look at your situation and ask yourself the
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   question, "How could I save on this expense?" And the key is that many people get overwhelmed
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.960]   with financial planning is they don't know where to start and they don't know where to continue
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.160]   and so they try to do it all and they're looking for some outside expert to give them the one thing.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:23.840]   There is no one thing but there are many things and you can coach yourself to being successful
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.720]   and effective with the many things if you'll take them one at a time. And so just pick one and if
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.480]   it means you make the decision and you're looking at your sales tax rate in your local community and
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.920]   you're looking at saying, "Well, wait a second. I've been in the US, we have different states,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.760]   some states that do have sales taxes and some states that don't." But if you say, "You know
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.480]   what? I need a new lawnmower for my yard and I've been meaning to take my family on vacation. I'm
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.000]   going to spend a couple thousand bucks on this lawnmower. Why don't we just go ahead and go
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.640]   across the state border and buy the lawnmower in the state that doesn't have the sales tax,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.120]   spend overnight there and take the family on a vacation and bring it home and you'll save a
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:04.080]   couple hundred bucks on sales tax. Do it." Now, that won't apply to somebody in London. I don't
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.480]   know what the jurisdiction is there but there's something like that that can be applied if you
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.360]   take them one at a time and then research each individual category and then track your results.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.800]   And you might be able to assemble something like that listener of mine who said,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   "Our lifestyle is far better because of this planning." And that's the ultimate goal.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.800]   A lot of people, one of my concerns and I love serving the early retirement financial
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.360]   independence community. That's a core part of my audience and a core part of my message.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:39.680]   But my concern often is that people might place all of their hope on that future eventuality
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.800]   instead of enjoying and appreciating today. Because none of us are promised tomorrow.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.400]   But you can live a better life now and you can work towards financial independence so that you
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.920]   have a better life in the future. Awesome. I think that's a great point to end on. And I mean,
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.720]   Joshua, it's been so great having you on. I have lots more things that I would love to ask you
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.160]   about. We'll have to do it another time. We'll have to do it another time. I'm thinking that
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.640]   it would be good to talk about investment and a bit more because we really focus on
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   employees and entrepreneurs. So that's an opportunity for the future. I wanted to say
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.600]   two things quickly. One is just to make the obvious point that this isn't advice.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.400]   Whatever you want to do with your money as a listener is up to you. This is just us having
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.520]   a conversation. I hope it's useful. But the purpose is to give you food for thought. So
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.560]   you have responsibility for your own money and do what you will with it.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.000]   This is just us putting this out there as food for thought. And the second thing I wanted to say
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.320]   is that for people who are interested and who are thinking about this, Joshua, where can they find
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.600]   out more about you and what you're doing? Two best ways. Number one, RadicalPersonalFinance.com
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.480]   if they prefer just to browse on the website. The website is, I guess, a good way you can read my
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.680]   about page, but it's not a great fit for podcast listeners. The best way to listen to the podcast
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.240]   is just search the app store on your phone for Radical Personal Finance and you'll find our app.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   It's a free app and that app will have all of the episodes. There's over 200 at this point.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.800]   My suggestion, pick one or two of the subject lines that seems interesting and see if you like
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.040]   the way that I do content. It's very different than many people. If you do like it, listen to
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.720]   a few shows and then if you want, go back and listen to the show from the beginning.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   My vision with the show is to present a cumulative curriculum over the course of a thousand episodes
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:34.720]   to try to deliver all of the content that I wish I had had at the age of 15 to be financially
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.760]   independent at an earlier age. So I generally don't repeat topics. I do my best to only cover
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:45.360]   a topic if there's an additional aspect to it, but it's across the board. It's pretty hardcore.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.840]   Some of it is very technical, but we talk about the financial planning lessons you can learn from
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.400]   dumpster divers and vagabonds and hobos. I talk about trust planning for advanced
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:01.840]   trusts. You've got to like pretty hardcore stuff, but if you do, the best way, just search the app
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.280]   store for radical personal finance and dig into a couple episodes that seem interesting.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.520]   Thanks so much, Joshua. It's been really fun having you on the show.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.080]   Thank you, Jake.
