[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.800]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.600]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.680]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.000]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.040]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.420]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.500]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.640]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.640]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.600]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.720]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.560]   Well, listeners, welcome back to the second week
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.280]   of our Summer Book Club series.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.380]   I hope that after last week's readings,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.360]   that you enjoyed some read aloud time with your family
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   and found a whole new world of conversation
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.120]   opening up to you after you listened
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.440]   to some of the stories from the Kings of Rome.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.740]   Today, I'm gonna be reading to you
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.360]   some selections for another one
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.240]   of our Copper Lodge Library Cycle 1 selections,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.320]   Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.840]   Now, I know that some of you
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   might not really want to explore insects,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.580]   but we're gonna see if we can't find something
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.580]   that's bigger than bugs about reading together as a family.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.260]   Let's talk for just a second.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.260]   Why read together in the summertime?
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.220]   I have to confess that to me,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.180]   that's like saying, "Why breathe in the summertime?"
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.980]   Reading together is just something that my girls and I,
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.440]   and my girls and my husband and I just naturally did.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.920]   I think because my husband and I were big readers,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.100]   we just enjoyed reading with our girls
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.740]   from the time they were very little
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.180]   all the way up through their adulthood.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.500]   We still, when our girls come home with their husbands,
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.540]   we still sometimes we'll sit around
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.180]   and read something together as a family.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.500]   Why do we do that?
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   Obviously not because they can't read for themselves.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.020]   We read together as a family to build rapport.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.180]   It is really a lot of fun when we read something together
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.560]   because we all get something different out of it.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.080]   And some of us like the selection and some of us don't,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.860]   and we can all share our reasons why and why not.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.180]   So we build, we read together to build rapport.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.320]   I remember reading with my children when they were young
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   and even when they were older
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.440]   because it was really important to me
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.880]   to build their imagination muscles.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.520]   When I was a little girl,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.040]   I think that I lived in my head a lot.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.180]   I loved to play outside with my friends
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.420]   and I loved to play doll house and I loved to play Barbies
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.160]   and I loved to make up stories with my friends
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.720]   and we would run around the yard,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.520]   run around the neighborhood being detectives
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.040]   or pioneers or pirates.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.960]   I wanted my girls to have a strong imagination
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   and we discovered early on that reading together
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.120]   really built their imagination muscles.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.680]   Sometimes they would want to stop
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.340]   in the middle of the story and say,
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.760]   but what would that look like?
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.560]   Or how could we do that?
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   And many afternoons when I turned them out of the house
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.880]   to play after our school day was over,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.560]   I could look out in the backyard and discover
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.420]   that they were playing whatever story
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.640]   we had read earlier in the day.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.120]   And I knew then that it worked,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.420]   that their imagination muscles were getting stronger.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.420]   We read together as a family to go places together
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.160]   that maybe we couldn't go in real life.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   We explored lands across the world
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.040]   through the books and stories and articles
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.240]   that we read together.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.400]   That's what I did when I was a little girl.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.520]   I learned about Persia when I read stories of princesses
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.280]   and about canals when I read stories
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.560]   that were set in Venice.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.440]   And I learned about different times and different customs.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.420]   And so when we read together as a family,
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.080]   we had that travel experience together.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.720]   One of the reasons, one of the best reasons
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.560]   for reading together in the summer
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   is that it gives us a reason to slow down and rest.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.120]   There's so much that our kids want to do in the summertime.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.480]   My kids always wanted to go to the pool
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.200]   or they wanted to go play with a friend
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.880]   or they wanted to go play in the creek
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.660]   or they wanted to go play tennis
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.760]   or they wanted to go to the movie
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.600]   or they wanted to go to the hobby store
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.920]   or get some craft, go, go, go, do, do, do.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.560]   Sometimes it's really good for us to rest, rest, rest.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.040]   And reading is a good way to get your children
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.080]   to take a break and to sit down together
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.160]   in the shade of a tree or in your air conditioned home
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.600]   or snuggled up under a blanket on a rainy day.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   It just gives you a reason to slow down together.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.400]   Reading together in the summer is really important.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   You can introduce new ideas when you and your children
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.760]   have a little extra time for those ideas to marinate.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.800]   I mean, think about marinate, I know it's a cooking word,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.960]   but what's the point of marinating a piece of meat?
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.080]   Well, you soften the piece of meat.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.000]   You can tell what kind of cuts of meat I'm used to buying.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.800]   Okay, so marinating will soften
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.900]   and tenderize that piece of meat.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.920]   Marinating can add notes of different flavors
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.760]   to that piece of meat.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.440]   Ideas need to marinate.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.080]   Sometimes they need to soften up a little bit
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.620]   so that we can chew on them a little more readily.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.840]   Sometimes we just kind of need them in the back of our mind
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   so that our subconscious works on them a little bit,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.400]   or we think about them a little bit at a time
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.680]   until we come to the realization
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.640]   of what we really think or feel about that idea.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.360]   Sometimes we do that together
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.000]   so that we can get an idea from one another
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.600]   of different flavors that might influence
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   how easily we can assimilate that idea into our thinking.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   One good reason to read aloud with your children this summer
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.640]   is to give some structure to your freedom.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.140]   You know, at the beginning of the summer,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.000]   we are all, all about being free.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.640]   We don't have a schedule.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.720]   Maybe at your house, you have one or two things
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.040]   you still do together or still do at a certain time,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.360]   but by and large, for most of us,
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.680]   the summer is free from a schedule.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.140]   But you know what I always discovered
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.200]   when my kids were young and there was no schedule
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.380]   for a protracted amount of time?
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.300]   Boredom set in really quickly.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:16.280]   Bored kids sometimes became contentious kids.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.240]   Sometimes they became overwhelmed.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.980]   Sometimes they became overstimulated
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.920]   because their desire was to do, do, do and go, go, go,
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.880]   and that's not sustainable over the long haul.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.080]   So reading aloud together as a family
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.960]   will give some structure to our freedom
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.000]   and bored kids and bored or overwhelmed
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   or overstimulated parents need that too.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.300]   Here's what I would say to you about reading as a family.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.000]   If you've never tried it before, try it.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.600]   You might just like it.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.980]   My suggestion for you this week,
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.420]   I think I said already is to check out
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.640]   our Copper Lodge Library book,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.600]   "Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul."
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.500]   Now this is the cycle one resource and you know,
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.220]   in the fall, we will, all of us everywhere,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.540]   be entering into cycle one
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.020]   and this would be a great read aloud,
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.660]   a morning read aloud, maybe a before nap time
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.860]   or rest time read aloud that would go along
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.040]   with a lot of the cycle one memory work
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.320]   that you'll encounter this year.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.020]   Why?
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.820]   Now, those of you out there who are saying,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.080]   "Thank you very much, I do not like bugs.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.440]   "I don't want insects.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.600]   "I don't think my children are going to enjoy any of that."
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.800]   Uncle Paul is not necessarily a story.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.480]   So it's not like the echoes, fairy tales,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.280]   fables and poems.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.600]   The Uncle Paul book is, it's a group of children
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.800]   who interact with their Uncle Paul,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.780]   but it's about real things, the real world,
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.400]   things that you and your children could go out
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.220]   and find in God's beautiful world as well.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.120]   So why Uncle Paul, Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul?
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.960]   Because it teaches us to marvel at the world
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   and God's creation is so worthy of wonder.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.320]   This book will really reacquaint you
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.120]   with how marvelous the world is
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.320]   and how many pieces there are
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.180]   that you don't consider very often.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.500]   Why read Uncle Paul, Insects?
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.500]   You might meet creatures in the pages of this book
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.680]   that you otherwise wouldn't.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.520]   Maybe some of these insects don't live near you,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.180]   or maybe you've never taken the trouble
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:04.180]   to look under things and find some of these insects.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:10.480]   Another good reason to pick up Exploring Insects
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   is that your children who love made-up stories
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.640]   and travel stories and fairy tales
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.240]   actually like to hear about real things too.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:30.080]   You will be able to collect
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.340]   specimens from the real world
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.520]   because you'll know what creatures are out there
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.100]   that you could look for.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.280]   If you pick up the Uncle Paul series,
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.320]   you will also be able to start
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.120]   your real world book collection,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.880]   collecting books about the natural world
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.160]   as well as literature books.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.040]   And listen, reading these stories
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.840]   will absolutely encourage you and your children
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.480]   to go outside and look at the world in a new way.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.980]   I have two selections from Exploring Insects
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.760]   with Uncle Paul that I would love to read with you today.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   So call your kids or pause the podcast at this spot
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.780]   and then ask your kids to come and listen with you
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.620]   if you'd like to.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.040]   You could even use this as a read-aloud for them.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.880]   I am going to read two selections,
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.280]   one chapter entitled "Spiders,"
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.060]   and then the next story,
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.580]   which is called "The Apira's Bridge."
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.460]   The Apira's Bridge, okay?
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.480]   So here we go.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.660]   And then after I read,
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.740]   I'm gonna give you a couple of tips,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   a few pointers for encouraging conversation and activity
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.580]   after you read, okay?
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.420]   Here goes.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.940]   Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul, "Spiders."
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.780]   One morning, Mother Ambrosine was chopping herbs
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.900]   and cooked apples for a brood of little chickens
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.580]   hatched not long before.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.760]   A large gray spider,
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.340]   letting itself slide the length of its thread,
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.340]   descended from the ceiling to the good woman's shoulders.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.380]   At sight of the creature with long, velvety legs,
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.540]   Mother Ambrosine could not suppress a cry of fear
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.500]   and shaking her shoulder made the insect fall
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.520]   and crushed it under her foot.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.340]   "Spider in the morning stands for morning,"
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.460]   she said to herself.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.460]   At this instant, Uncle Paul and Claire entered.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.940]   "No, sir, it is not right," said Mother Ambrosine,
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.780]   "that we poor mortals should have so much useless trouble.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.420]   12 little chickens are hatched out for us bright as gold.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.340]   And just as I am preparing them something to eat,
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.700]   a villainous spider falls on my shoulder."
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.060]   And Mother Ambrosine pointed with her finger
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.060]   at the crushed insect with its legs still trembling.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.700]   "I do not see that those little chickens
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.700]   have anything to fear from the spider," remarked Uncle Paul.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.420]   "Oh, nothing, sir, the horrid creature is dead.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.420]   But you know the proverb, spider in the morning, mourning.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.380]   Spider at night, delight.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.380]   Everybody knows that a spider seen in the morning
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.060]   is a sign of bad luck.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.460]   Our little chickens are in danger.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.020]   The cats will claw them.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.500]   You'll see, sir, you'll see."
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.920]   Tears of emotion came to Mother Ambrosine's eyes.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.420]   "Put the little chickens in a safe place.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.180]   Watch the cats and I'll answer for the rest.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.180]   The proverb of the spider is only a foolish prejudice,"
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.600]   said Uncle Paul.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.920]   Mother Ambrosine did not utter another word.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   She knew that Maitre Paul found a reason for everything
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.080]   and on occasion was capable
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.960]   of pronouncing a eulogy on the spider.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   Claire, who saw this eulogy coming, ventured a question.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.880]   "I know in your eyes, all animals,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.720]   however hideous they may be,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.960]   have excellent excuses to plead.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.440]   All merit consideration,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.720]   all play a part ordained by providence,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.680]   all are interesting to observe and to study.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.280]   You are the advocate of the good God's creatures.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.360]   You would plead for the toad,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.680]   but permit your niece to see
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.400]   they're only an impulse of your kind heart
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.600]   and not the real truth.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.280]   What could you say in praise of the spider?
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.200]   Horrid beast, which is poisonous
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.060]   and disfigures the ceiling with its webs.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.440]   What could I say?
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   Much, my dear child, much.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.760]   In the meantime, feed your little chickens
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.160]   and beware of cats
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   if you want to prove the spider proverb false."
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.700]   In the evening, Mother Ambrosine,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.500]   her round spectacles on her nose was knitting stockings.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.200]   On her knees, the cat slipped
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.400]   and mingled its purring with the tick-tack of the needles.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.560]   The children were waiting for the story of the spider.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.220]   Their uncle began,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.680]   "Which of you three can tell me
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.120]   what spiders do with their webs,
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.500]   those fine webs stretched in the corners of the granary
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.400]   or between two shrubs in the garden?"
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.680]   Emile spoke first.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.680]   "It is their nest, uncle, their house, their hiding place."
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.220]   "Hiding place," exclaimed Jules.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.860]   "Yes, I think it is more than that.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.800]   One day I heard between the lilac bushes
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.360]   a little shrill noise.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.500]   (Emile squeals)
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   A blue fly was entangled in a cobweb and trying to escape.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.120]   It was the fly that was making that noise
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.880]   with its fluttering.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.760]   A spider ran from the bottom of the silken funnel,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.240]   seized the fly and carried it off to its hold,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.100]   doubtless to eat it.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.100]   Since then, I have thought spiders' webs were hunting nets."
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.840]   "That is even so," said his uncle.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.720]   "All spiders live on live prey.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   They make continual war on flies, gnats, other insects.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.200]   If you fear mosquitoes, those insufferable little insects
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   that sting us at night till they bring the blood,
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.960]   you must bless the spider,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.640]   for it does its best to rid us of them.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.780]   To catch game, a net is necessary.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.600]   Now, the net to catch flies in their flight
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.240]   is a cloth woven with silk,
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.980]   which the spider itself produces.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.560]   In the body of the insect,
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.160]   the silky matter is, as with caterpillars,
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.160]   a sticky liquid resembling glue or gum.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.380]   As soon as it comes in contact with the air,
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.360]   this matter congeals, it hardens,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   and becomes a thread on which water has no effect.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.740]   When the spider wants to spin,
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.400]   the silk liquid flows from four nipples,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.160]   called spinnerets, placed at the end of the stomach.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   These nipples are pierced at their extremity
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   by a number of holes, like a sprinkler of a watering pot.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.040]   The number of these holes for all the nipples
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.340]   is roughly reckoned as 1,000.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.340]   Each one lets its tiny little jet of liquid flow,
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.600]   which hardens and becomes thread.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.360]   And from 1,000 threads stuck together into one,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.720]   results the final thread employed by the spider.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.400]   To designate something very fine,
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.560]   there is no better term of comparison
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.640]   than the spider's thread.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   It's so delicate, in fact, it can only just be seen.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.600]   Our silk threads, those of the finest textures,
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   are cables in comparison, cables of two, three, four strands,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.200]   while this one, in its unequaled tenuity, contains 1,000.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.640]   How many spider's threads are required
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.280]   to make a strand of the thickness of a hair?
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.160]   Not far from 10.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.240]   And how many elementary threads,
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.660]   such as issue from the separate holes of the spinneret?
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.980]   10,000.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.580]   To what degree of tenuity,
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.940]   then, the silk matter can be reduced
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.140]   that stretches out in threads of which it takes 10,000
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.560]   to equal the size of one hair.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.080]   What marvels, my children,
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.900]   and only to catch a fly
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.240]   that is to serve for the spider's dinner.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:27.440]   Now, also from exploring insects with Uncle Paul,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.780]   the Epirus Bridge.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:35.760]   Here, Uncle Paul caught Claire looking at him thoughtfully.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.020]   It was evident that some change was taking place
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.000]   in her mind.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   The spider was no longer a repulsive creature,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.420]   unworthy of our regard.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.020]   Uncle Paul continued,
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.940]   "With its legs armed with sharp-toothed little claws
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.980]   "like combs, the spider draws the thread
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.100]   "from its spinnerets as it has need.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.180]   "If it wishes to descend, like the one this morning
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.780]   "that came down from the ceiling
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.620]   "onto Mother Ambrosine's shoulder,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.380]   "it glues the end of the thread to the point of departure
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.380]   "and lets itself fall perpendicularly.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.320]   "The thread is drawn from the spinnerets
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.140]   "by the weight of the spider,
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.020]   "and the latter, softly suspended,
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.220]   "descends to any depth it wishes,
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.360]   "and as slowly as it pleases.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.960]   "In order to ascend again,
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.660]   "it climbs up the thread by folding it gradually
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.340]   "into a skein between its legs.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.060]   "For a second descent,
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.240]   "the spider has only to let its skein of silk unwind,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.480]   "little by little.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.560]   "To weave its web,
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   "each kind of spider has its own method of procedure,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.820]   "according to the kind of game it's going to hunt,
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.720]   "the places it frequents,
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.000]   "and according to its particular inclinations,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.840]   "tastes, and instincts.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.840]   "I will merely tell you a few words about the apira,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.940]   "large spiders magnificently speckled with yellow,
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.380]   "black, and silvery white.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.140]   "They are hunters of big game,
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.040]   "of green or blue damsel flies
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   "that frequent the water courses,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.920]   "of butterflies and large flies.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   "They stretch their web vertically between two trees,
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   "and even from one bank of a stream to the other.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.860]   "Let us examine this last case.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   "An apira has found a good place for hunting.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.240]   "The dragonflies, or blue and green damsel flies,
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.680]   "come and go from one tuft of reeds to another,
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.220]   "sometimes going up, sometimes down the stream.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.120]   "Along its course are butterflies also,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.780]   "and horseflies, or large flies that suck blood from cattle.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.500]   "The sight is a good one.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.660]   "Now then, to work.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.780]   "The apira climbs to the top of a willow
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.020]   "at the water's edge.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:36.020]   "There, it matures its plan, an audacious one,
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:41.040]   "the execution of which seems, psh, impossible.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.540]   "A suspension bridge, a cable,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.700]   "which serves as support for the future web,
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.700]   "must be stretched from one bank to the other.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.640]   "And observe, children,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.180]   "that the spider cannot cross the stream by swimming.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.740]   "It would perish by drowning
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.800]   "if it ventured into the water.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.060]   "It must stretch its cable, its bridge,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.060]   "from the top of its branch without changing place.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.760]   "Never has an engineer found himself in such difficulties.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.960]   "What will the little creature do?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.600]   "Put your heads together, children.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.820]   "I'm waiting for your ideas."
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.860]   Hmm.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.120]   "Build a bridge from one side to the other
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.480]   "without crossing the water or moving away from its place?
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   "If a spider can do that, it's cleverer than I am."
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.660]   Thus spoke Jules.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.340]   "Then I too," chimed in his brother.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.880]   "If I did not already know," said Claire,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.920]   "since you've just told us
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.860]   "that the spider does accomplish it,
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.700]   "I should say that its bridge is impossible."
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.920]   Mother Ambrosine said nothing,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.000]   but by the slackening of the tic-tac of her needles,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.560]   everyone could see that she was much interested
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.440]   in the spider's bridge.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.680]   "Animals often have more intelligence than we,"
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.360]   continued Uncle Paul.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.240]   "The apira will prove it to us.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   "With its hind legs, it draws a thread from its spinneret.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.160]   "The thread lengthens and lengthens.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.460]   "It floats from the top of the branch.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.200]   "The spider draws out more and more.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   "Finally, it stops.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.220]   "Is the thread long enough?
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.640]   "Is it too short?
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.360]   "That is what must be looked after.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.260]   "If it's too long,
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.120]   "it would be wasting the precious, silky liquid.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.060]   "If too short, it would not fulfill the given conditions.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.920]   "A glance is thrown at the distance to be crossed,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.120]   "an exact glance, you may be sure.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.100]   "The thread is found too short.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.900]   "The spider lengthens it by drawing out a little more.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.000]   "Now all goes well.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.160]   "The thread has the wished-for length and the work is done.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.220]   "The apira waits at the top of its branch.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.740]   "The rest will be accomplished without help.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.280]   "From time to time, it bears with its long legs
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   "on the thread to see if it resists.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.560]   "Ah, it resists.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.680]   "The bridge is fixed.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   "The spider crosses the stream on its suspension bridge.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.280]   "What's happened then?
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.120]   "This.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.620]   "The thread floated from the top of the willow.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.180]   "A breath of air blew the free end of the thread
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.760]   "into the branches on the opposite bank.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.560]   "This end got tangled there.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.920]   "Behold the mystery.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.520]   "The apira has only to draw the thread to itself
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.420]   "to stretch it properly and make a suspension bridge of it.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.260]   "Oh, how simple," cried Jules.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.740]   And yet not one of us would have thought of it.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.780]   Yes, my friend, it is very simple,
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.780]   but at the same time, very ingenious.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.300]   It is thus with all work.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   Simplicity in the means employed is a sign of excellence.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.460]   To simplify is to have knowledge.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.220]   To complicate is to be ignorant.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   The apira in its kind of construction is science perfected.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   "Where does it get that science, Uncle?" asked Claire.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.500]   Animals have not reason.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.900]   Who then teaches the apira to build its suspension bridges?
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.980]   No one, my dear child.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.100]   It's born with this knowledge.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.540]   It has it by instinct.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.140]   The infallible inspiration of the father of all things
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.280]   who creates in the least of his creatures
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.480]   for their preservation ways of acting
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.460]   before which our reason is often confounded.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.860]   When the apira from the top of the willow
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.100]   gets ready to spin its web,
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.940]   what inspires it without the audacious project of the bridge?
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.900]   What gives it patience to wait for the floating end
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.660]   of the thread to entwine in the branches of the other bank?
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.560]   What assures it of the success of a labor
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.860]   that is performing perhaps for the first time
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.180]   and is never seen done?
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:54.100]   It is the universal reason that watches over creation
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.740]   and takes among men the thrice holy name of Providence.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.820]   Uncle Paul had won his case in the eyes of all,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.860]   even of Mother Ambrosine.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.860]   Spiders were no longer frightful creatures.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:20.440]   Now, I hope you enjoyed the two stories
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.900]   that I read you today.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.020]   I want you to know there are more stories
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.180]   about spiders and spiders' webs
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.380]   and even what spiders might do with their webs
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.300]   inside the pages of "Exploring Insects with Uncle Paul."
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.760]   I think that you might be fascinated.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.440]   Mom and dad, remember that there are lots of ways
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.240]   to start great conversations and great explorations
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.740]   with the reading that you do with your children.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.740]   One thing you might have noticed as you heard the story,
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.260]   there are some words in the story
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.020]   that your very young children might not be familiar with,
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.060]   and even your older children
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.980]   might have trouble reading on their own.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.400]   But the glorious thing about reading aloud
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.740]   is that you, as the parent, can use your voice
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.540]   to give explanation for these words.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.060]   And so in the context of the story,
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.560]   your children are able to figure out
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.180]   what unfamiliar words mean.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.460]   The cool thing is that this increases
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.660]   our children's listening level
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.340]   while their reading level may not quite catch up yet.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.020]   It's another great reason to read aloud with your children.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.340]   One of the things that you could do with your children
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.500]   is to go back and ask them,
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.340]   do you know what these words mean?
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.340]   You might want to talk about prejudice or the word merit.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:02.300]   Some of your little children
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.820]   might not know the word designate, okay?
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.740]   Looking back through these,
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.540]   you might want to find a picture of a spider
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.380]   and locate its spinneret.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.380]   Maybe you'll have to explain what a skein is,
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.420]   a skein like we have of yarn.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.520]   There are all kinds of things that you can do
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   to expand the vocabulary of your family by reading aloud.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.220]   There are also questions that you can ask your listeners,
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.340]   questions like those that we practiced last week
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.180]   using the five core habits of naming, attending,
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.360]   memorizing, expressing, and storytelling.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.260]   The simplest thing to do is to ask your children,
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.540]   what creature is this story about?
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.260]   Who are the people in the story?
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.540]   How are they related?
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.620]   You might even ask them,
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.540]   what do you think the spiders in the story looked like?
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.980]   Some of the descriptions are given for us.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.360]   So you can name the creature and name the people,
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:21.360]   but naming is also about exploring categories.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.940]   That's one of the cool things
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.040]   about our foundation's memory work.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.180]   We don't just give our children things to memorize,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.900]   we put them into categories
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.180]   so that our children are building structures
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.660]   for their mind palaces.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.540]   Structures of categories that allow them
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.980]   to put things into the categories
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.060]   and add to from time to time,
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.420]   always having a spot to place new information.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.380]   So you could explore some of these categories.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.960]   Are spiders insects?
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.060]   What else is an insect?
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.980]   What is it that makes them insects?
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.580]   What are the characteristics that designate
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.380]   an insect?
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.740]   You could go outside and find some spiders.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.580]   If your children are ready to move
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.720]   after they've spent some time listening,
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.500]   go outside and find some spiders.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.340]   You could even talk about how you feel about this task.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.700]   How do you feel about spiders?
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.620]   Do you feel like Mother Ambrosine felt
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.580]   or do you feel like Uncle Paul felt about spiders?
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.420]   Mother Ambrosine in this first story,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.100]   muttered a proverb about spiders.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.820]   What is a proverb?
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.060]   Maybe you would want to explore proverbs
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.140]   with your children.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.760]   What is a proverb?
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.040]   Are they really true?
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.220]   What are some of the other proverbs
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.160]   that you and your family may have heard before?
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.780]   After you hear these stories,
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.340]   your children might really be curious
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.900]   about how spiders construct their webs.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.300]   And are all spider webs the same?
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.820]   It seems like Uncle Paul was saying
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.300]   that spiders make their webs different ways
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.340]   to suit different purposes,
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.660]   different neighborhoods, if you will,
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.400]   or different prey that they might be trying to catch.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.380]   Why can't we make a spider web?
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.680]   You could explore that.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.020]   You could even get some string
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.140]   and encourage your children to try to build a web
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.100]   that looks like a web you could find outside.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.340]   You could, if you and your children are interested,
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.500]   look at the anatomy of a spider.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.020]   What are the parts of a spider
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.180]   that allow it to build a web?
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:59.540]   Could you draw a spider after you do some of your research?
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.100]   Uncle Paul makes a big deal
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.940]   that a pirate makes a suspension bridge.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.020]   Now, there are all kinds of bridges.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.620]   Maybe you and your children would like to explore
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.300]   the different kinds of bridges that exist
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.940]   and how they are constructed.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.800]   What do spiders and bridges
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.940]   really have to do with one another?
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.940]   Have you ever built a bridge?
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.500]   Maybe your children have done a science activity
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.940]   building a suspension bridge before,
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.220]   or maybe they would like to do it with you
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.020]   after you read this story.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:40.020]   Do you think you could use the spider's plan to build one?
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.780]   Hmm, maybe you want to explore
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.980]   what other kinds of spiders there are.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.740]   Where do spiders live near you?
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.660]   What kinds of spiders live near you?
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.780]   And what kinds of spiders live far away
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   that you would never see unless you looked one up in a book?
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:07.680]   What are some useful things that spiders do
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.540]   or that spiders produce?
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.180]   Uncle Paul gave us some ideas
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.860]   about how spiders might be seen as helpful to us.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   Here's another idea.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   If you were going to write a story about a spider family,
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.580]   what would their names be?
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.580]   If you were going to write a story about a spider family,
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.820]   what would their names be?
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.060]   What are some spidery names?
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.260]   Maybe you want to be a little more philosophical.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.640]   Why do you think God made spiders?
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.740]   What purpose do they serve in God's wide world?
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.120]   Maybe reading about these spiders
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.080]   has made you eager to look for other spider resources.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.000]   If you go to the library or go to the bookstore
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.480]   or maybe even browse the books you already have,
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.120]   I bet you'll find a lot about spiders.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.200]   Here are some other spider books.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.760]   There's the fiction books,
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.840]   "The Beloved Charlotte's Web" by E.B. White,
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.760]   Eric Carle's "The Very Busy Spider"
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.640]   is especially appropriate for your littlest listeners.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.840]   "Anansi the Spider, a Tale from the Ashanti"
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.960]   by Gerald McDermott is a great,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.920]   beautifully illustrated tale from another land.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.520]   And there are lots of nonfiction books.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.760]   From the picture-driven fun facts
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.640]   to National Geographic books for kids of all ages.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   There are all kinds of ways for you to explore spiders
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.040]   that maybe you've never given much thought to before.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.160]   You'll listen to the story
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.960]   on "Exploring Insects" from Uncle Paul.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:05.040]   So I hope that you enjoyed this session
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.480]   of the Summer Reading Club,
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.880]   where we looked at the Copper Lodge Library book,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.000]   "Exploring Insects" with Uncle Paul.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.600]   I'd encourage you to take a look
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.720]   at the other Copper Lodge Library tales that we have.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.640]   We have lots of titles.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.920]   One of our newest is "The Secret Garden."
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.000]   If your kids are excited about observing nature
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.560]   and going outside to look for a spider
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.400]   or planting some seeds,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   or maybe taking over a section of your backyard,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.480]   "The Secret Garden" might really pique their interest.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.200]   This is a beautiful tale of children
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.960]   who become the gardeners
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.920]   of a long-neglected and secret garden.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.840]   And the Copper Lodge Library edition
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.760]   is a great way for you guys
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.200]   to begin building a library of beautiful books
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.440]   that can serve your family with delight for years.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.360]   So take a look at the Copper Lodge Library,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.360]   especially "The Secret Garden."
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.640]   And I will look forward to reading together
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.120]   with you again next week.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.960]   Bye-bye.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.720]   (gentle music)
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.780]   you
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.840]   you
