[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   - The things that you are getting in touch with,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean,
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.400]   there's a predictability of them
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.040]   because you can access them in a predictable way,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.540]   but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.560]   The ocean is completely unpredictable.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.080]   - I also listened to a lot of music that I don't know.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.800]   So I listened to a lot of classical music
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.560]   and less so, but some jazz
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.880]   and a lot of old music that I never heard before.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.400]   And I like being surprised by music.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.440]   And sometimes it really catches me off guard.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.400]   Like I shazam a lot, you know,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.740]   when I hear something I like.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.800]   - Have you ever encountered music
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   that really works well live,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.140]   but just does not work in a recording?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.760]   Or that is that much better live,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.680]   but the recording is sort of meh.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.400]   You don't have to name names.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.240]   - Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.760]   I feel like maybe there are some artists who are great live
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.580]   who've never captured it well on record.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.240]   Example would probably be the Grateful Dead's
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.520]   good example of a band where I feel like their albums
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.760]   are not their strong point,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   but they're, if you hear live recordings,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.960]   they're really interesting
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.880]   and really different from each other.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.560]   And that's kind of part of what makes
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   the Grateful Dead interesting, is their unpredictability.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.360]   - I confess, I have a sister who listened to the Grateful Dead
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.520]   and I got taken to a few shows when I was younger
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.760]   and they would do that, what is it called, space?
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.640]   It was like these drum solos
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.120]   that would go on for hours and hours.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.000]   This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.120]   where songs are like 90 to 120 seconds.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.640]   And like, you know, and I remember thinking like,
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.380]   what is this?
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.220]   What is this?
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.640]   But people I know who love the Grateful Dead,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   love that uncertainty about where that drum thing,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.400]   I think they do call it space.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.560]   Forgive me, Deadheads, I'm not enough of one
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.640]   to get it right.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760]   - But they're looking for something
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.600]   and sometimes they find it.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.560]   And if you're there when they find it, it feels exciting.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   'Cause it's not just following a script.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.800]   It's like something is really happening.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.960]   It's a real moment.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   It's something that I aim for in the studio
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.320]   is to create real moments that when you hear them,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.120]   they don't necessarily sound perfect.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.600]   They sound like something that really happened.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960]   And in that moment, something happened
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.880]   and it's a special moment.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   And you can feel that if they were to play it again,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.560]   it wouldn't be like that.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680]   There's something really exciting about that.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.280]   It's really how jazz works as well.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   And I think some of bringing some of that jazz mentality
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.600]   into other types of music is really interesting,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   makes for compelling things.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.880]   'Cause when you hear them, there's a certain amount of,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.480]   you really have to pay attention to do it.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.920]   When you're doing it, you're really paying attention.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.720]   It's like, I don't really know.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   There's no music, there's no map to follow.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.860]   And now we're working together to make something.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.680]   Do I play or not play?
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.280]   When do I play?
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   And you're really paying attention.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.240]   And can I add, or you go to start adding something
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.080]   and someone else added something.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.320]   It's like, oh, I can't do that.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   And it's like, everyone's just in this thing,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   in this moment, experiencing this thing at once
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.420]   that you can feel as a listener.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.420]   And we get to hear their excitement of finding it.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.960]   And it's thrilling when it happens.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.980]   So I like that experience.
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.640]   I feel like that's kind of what the dead do live.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.700]   They'll play songs in different ways.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.200]   And again, I don't know very much about the dead
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   and it's newer for me to listen to the dead.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.600]   Growing up, I never listened to the dead.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.120]   But probably because I heard songs on their albums
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.960]   and thought, this doesn't really speak to me.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.040]   But I think that the albums don't really reflect
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.960]   what's special about them.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.880]   - I think a lot of their shows were recorded, right?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.840]   Or videotaped.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.000]   - Yeah, but by fans, which they supported.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.740]   They supported that everybody come, everybody tape,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.200]   everybody trade tapes.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.160]   It made sense for who that band was.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.040]   - They redefined or they defined, excuse me,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.160]   the notion of followers.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.200]   I mean, people literally gave up their lives
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   or spent much of their lives
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.440]   literally driving from city to city to follow them.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.760]   - Because it's not like going from city to city
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.960]   to watch a movie over and over.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.400]   'Cause it's not a movie.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.640]   It's different every night.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.520]   It's changing.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.360]   - Pretty incredible phenomenon.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.000]   I don't know of anything else quite like it,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.560]   except cults.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.640]   And those often don't end well.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.680]   I think a guy that mixed the pawnship
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.840]   for the Jonestown Masker went to my high school.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.880]   That was the- - Is that true?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.080]   - I think so, yeah. - That's amazing.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.760]   - My sister is really good at all this
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   kind of like '70s, '80s, like dark psychology trivia.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.920]   She's a very light person, but-
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.120]   - Did you read "Season of the Witch"?
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.960]   - No.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.680]   - It's about San Francisco in the '60s.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.360]   It's great, you'll love it.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.280]   - One great book. - I'll have to check it out.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.860]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.440]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.020]   (upbeat music)
