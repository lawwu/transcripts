[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   - Again, maybe a romanticized philosophical question,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.620]   but when you look up at the stars,
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.800]   knowing that there's at least 100 billion of them
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.360]   in the Milky Way galaxy, right?
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.680]   So we're really a small speck in this giant thing
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.540]   that's the visible universe.
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.240]   How does that make you feel about our efforts here?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.440]   - I love the perspective.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.720]   I love that perspective.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.600]   I always open my public talks
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.680]   to the big Hubble Space Telescope image
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.200]   looking out into, you mentioned just now,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   the solar system, the Milky Way.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.960]   'Cause I think it's really important to know
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.820]   that we're just a small pale blue dot.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.760]   We're really fortunate.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.640]   We're on the best planet by far.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.160]   Life is fantastic here. - That we know of.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.000]   You're confident this is the best planet.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.360]   - I'm pretty sure it's the best planet,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.720]   the best planet that we know of.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.560]   I mean, I search my research as you know,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.960]   in mission worlds, and when will we find life?
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.160]   I think actually in probably the next decade,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.720]   we find probably past life,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.520]   probably the evidence of past life on Mars, let's say.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.240]   - You think there was once life on Mars?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.600]   Or do you think there's currently?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.120]   - I'm more comfortable saying probably 3.5 billion years ago
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.840]   feel pretty confident there was life on Mars
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.480]   just because then it had an electromagnetic shield,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.720]   it had an atmosphere, has a wonderful gravity level,
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.440]   3 Hg is fantastic.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.280]   You know, you're all super human,
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.720]   we can all slam dunk a basketball.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.520]   I mean, it's gonna be fun to play sports on Mars.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.080]   So I think we'll find past,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.340]   no fossilized probably the evidence of past life on Mars.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.400]   Currently, that's again, we need the next decade,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520]   but the evidence is mounting for sure.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.800]   We do have the organics, we're finding organics,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.320]   we have water, seasonal water on Mars.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.600]   We used to just know about the ice caps,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.520]   you know, North and South Pole.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.120]   Now we have seasonal water.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.240]   We do have the building blocks for life on Mars.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.480]   We really need to dig down into the soil
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.440]   'cause everything on the top surface is radiated.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.960]   But once we find down, will we see any life forms?
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.800]   Will we see any bugs?
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.120]   I leave it open as a possibility,
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.300]   but I feel pretty certain that past life
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900]   or fossilized life forms we'll find.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.260]   And then we have to get to all these ocean worlds,
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.320]   these beautiful moons of other planets
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.540]   since we know they have water
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.420]   and we're looking for simple search for life,
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.540]   for follow the water, you know, carbon-based life.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.900]   That's the only life we know.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.600]   There could be other life forms that we don't know about,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.620]   but it's hard to search for them 'cause we don't know.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.080]   So in our search for life in the solar system
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.940]   is definitely, you know, search, you know,
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.220]   let's follow the water
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.140]   and look for the building blocks of life.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.380]   - So you think in the next decade,
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.260]   we might see hints of past life or even current life?
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.100]   - I think so.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.740]   That's pretty optimistic. - I love the optimism.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.580]   - I'm pretty optimistic.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.940]   - Do humans have to be involved
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.540]   or can this be robots and rovers and--
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.380]   - Probably teams.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.740]   I mean, we've been at it on Mars in particular 50 years.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.740]   We've been exploring Mars for 50 years.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.620]   Great data, right?
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.900]   Our images of Mars today are phenomenal.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.180]   Now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.200]   You know, we're starting to know
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.020]   because of the lack of the electromagnet shield.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.020]   We know about the water on Mars.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.580]   So we've been studying 50 years with our robots.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.540]   We still haven't found it.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.780]   So I think once we have a human mission there,
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.900]   we just accelerate things.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.420]   It's always humans and our rovers and robots together,
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.820]   but we just have to think that 50 years
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.900]   we've been looking at Mars and taking images
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.980]   and doing the best science that we can.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.380]   People need to realize Mars is really far away.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.620]   It's really hard to get to.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.020]   You know, it's this extreme, extreme exploration.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.340]   We mentioned Magellan first
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.380]   or all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.060]   which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.500]   Mars is a different ball game.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.580]   I mean, it's eight months to get there,
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.140]   year and a half to get home.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.460]   I mean, it's really extreme.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.700]   - Harsh environment in all kinds of ways.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.260]   But the kind of organism we might be able to see hints of
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.780]   on Mars are kind of microorganisms, perhaps.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.420]   - Yeah, and remember that humans,
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.840]   we're kind of, you know, we're hosts, right?
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.780]   We're hosts to all of our bacteria and viruses, right?
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.900]   - Do you think it's a big leap from the viruses
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.980]   and the bacteria to us humans?
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.420]   Put another way, do you think on all those moons,
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.180]   beautiful wet moons that you mentioned,
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   you think there's intelligent life out there?
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.620]   - I hope so.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.620]   I mean, that's the hope,
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.980]   but, you know, we don't have the scientific evidence
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.940]   for that now.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.380]   I think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.920]   is much more compelling, again,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.300]   'cause we have the building blocks of life now.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.140]   When that life turns into intelligence,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.860]   that's a big unknown.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.740]   - If we ever meet, do you think we'll be able
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.100]   to find a common language?
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.980]   - I hope so.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.020]   We haven't met yet.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.900]   It's just so far.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.940]   I mean, do physics just play a role here?
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.340]   Look at all these exoplanets, 6,000 exoplanets.
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.780]   I mean, even the couple dozen Earth-like planets
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.400]   that are exoplanets that really look like habitable planets.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.420]   These are very Earth-like.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.860]   They look like they have all the building blocks.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.740]   I can't wait to get there.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.740]   The only thing is they're 10 to 100 light years away.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.140]   So scientifically, we know they're there.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.460]   We know that they're habitable.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.660]   They have everything going for them, right?
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.900]   In the Goldilocks zone, not too hot, not too cold,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.540]   just perfect for habitability for life.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.180]   But now the reality is if they're 10, at the best,
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.640]   to 100, to thousands of light years away,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.540]   so what's out there?
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.900]   But I just can't think that we're not the only ones.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.220]   So absolutely life, life in the universe,
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.940]   probably intelligent life as well.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:18.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:28.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
