[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Most of you will remember that we are dealing at the moment with the words found in Paul's
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.240]   epistle to the Romans in chapter 14 and verse 17. Verse 17 in the 14th chapter of the epistle
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.520]   to the Romans. "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.680]   peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.640]   Now this tremendous asseveration on the part of the great apostle last Friday evening,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.800]   and I was showing you how. Here the apostle leaves the realm of pure argumentation as
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.440]   it were and lifts up the whole subject of eating meat offered to idols and the observance
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.280]   of particular days. He lifts it up into the realm of ultimate spiritual truth. In other
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.840]   words he puts it as it were into its family and enables us to see it in the right context.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.440]   Now I indicated that this is something that the apostle does so frequently, so characteristic
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.600]   of him, and of course it is of the very essence of presenting the Christian truth. He asserts
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.040]   a great principle here which we must never forget, and that is the vital importance of
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.200]   balance and a sense of proportion and a true perspective in the Christian life. In other
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.120]   words what he is saying is this, that most of the troubles in the church always arise
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:40.360]   through our failure to preserve a sense of balance. I reminded you how our Lord put it
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.000]   in those words that we read together just now. In the case of the Pharisees, that was
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.280]   the whole trouble with the Pharisees. These were men who were greatly interested in the
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.240]   kingdom of God. It was their greatest interest, and yet they rejected and ultimately brought
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.440]   about the crucifixion of the king. Why? Simply because they lacked this balance. He puts
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.920]   it in one verse, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For he tithe mint
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.080]   and rue," not rue here, "mint and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.520]   matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. These, not if you have done, are not to leave
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.960]   the other under. Experts on mint and anise and cumin." Ignoring the weightier matters
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.160]   of the thing that rarely count. And that is why they were outside the kingdom, though
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   they had such great interest in it. Now, this, as I was suggesting to you, has been throughout
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.400]   the centuries the greatest cause of trouble in the Church, and especially of division
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.960]   in the Church. Let's remember, division in the Church is a scandal. It is sin. The Church
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.040]   is to be one, and she is to be visibly one. That's the meaning of our Lord's prayer
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.480]   as recorded in John 17. And divisions have come. This is the whole point I'm making.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.320]   Going to the failure of people to realize that there are things which have relative
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.280]   importance. And because they fail to remember this and take things in their right context,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.080]   they have gone astray. This is something to which we are all liable. And as I tried to
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.920]   show you, we can do this in doctrine. I mean direct doctrine of salvation and so on. We
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.720]   can do it with regard to Church order, and we can do it with regard to practice also
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.400]   in our daily life and living. This lack of balance. Look at the trouble it's causing
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.720]   at the present time, as it has always seemed to do throughout the centuries. Now, I gave
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   you some examples just to show you the kind of thing I had in mind. I suggested that many
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.040]   a denomination has come into being really because men have failed to observe this principle.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.560]   I was able to show that most movements have certainly come into being for the same reason.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.000]   The whole question of whether there should be such thing as movement arises. But we saw
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.400]   how almost invariably they've come into being through a lack of balance, an overemphasis
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.880]   of something, or an under-emphasis of something else. And I did hint at the fact that this
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.760]   whole question arises here of your view of scriptural truth. I suggested it is always
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.440]   wrong to regard this just as an academic subject. So the whole question of teaching it in schools
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.160]   comes in. Now, I believe that some have misunderstood partly what I was saying there. I'm talking
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.040]   about the principle itself. People said, "Well then, does that mean that those of us who
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   are Christians should never teach scripture in schools?" Not at all. While the law of
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.440]   the land commends this and says this should be done, well then my argument is that Christians
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.240]   should do it. They're the only people who can do it properly. What I'm objecting to
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.960]   is the notion that it is just a subject like other secular subjects, and it comes one in
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.400]   a list. If they do want religious instruction in schools, and if it's compulsory, well
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.080]   then let it be done by people who believe the scriptures and who understand them, and
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.560]   who are truly Christians. That doesn't say that I believe in the system, but that should
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.040]   put those who are Christians who are in trouble at this point, I trust, at ease. But I also
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.480]   showed you that the same thing arises in theological colleges and seminaries, and that the trouble
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.680]   has come in there, again through regarding this as an academic subject. And your interest
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.200]   becomes greater in the acquiring of degrees and diplomas than in the knowledge of the
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.280]   truth. And it's often done in a purely detached, objective, theoretical manner, forgetting
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.480]   that all knowledge that is to be found in the scripture should always be dealt with
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.760]   in a worshipful manner. I don't like the idea of Bible lectures for that reason. I
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:08.120]   believe in the service. Worship and exposition of scripture is a part of that service of
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.160]   worship and of praise. Now then, the trouble I suggested was that there's always been
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.560]   this danger of isolating these matters and not dealing with them in their context. You
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   see, this is what he's saying. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.440]   and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. Very well, having then sort of opened the subject
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.200]   out to you like that, I believe we're now in a position to lay down certain rules, general
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:48.840]   rules which can govern us in this whole matter. And here are some of them. The first is that
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:59.240]   parts and portions of truth only have importance in their relationship to the whole, not in
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   and of themselves. Now, a great illustration of this point is, of course, to be found in
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.040]   1 Corinthians 12. That's the whole object of that chapter where Paul reminds us that
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:19.240]   the church is the body of Christ. And we are members in particular of that body. And he
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.600]   ridicules this whole notion that you think of any particular part or portion or member
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:32.360]   in isolation. It's ridiculous. The body is not a mere collection of parts. And the part
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:41.080]   must never be considered in and of itself, but always in relationship to the whole. The
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:49.800]   failure to remember that has been prolific in its causing of trouble. Very well, I can
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.880]   put that like this, that if the parts have no importance except in their relationship
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.200]   to the whole, the second point is that the parts must never be considered in isolation.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.720]   I showed you that in the case of movement. That's the defect of most movements. Prophetic
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.240]   movement, holiness movement. It's wrong. It's fundamentally wrong. It's a violation
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:19.720]   of this teaching. If you isolate any one of these things and consider it on its own,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.840]   you're bound to go wrong. And people have gone wrong. Apparitions have always come into
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.440]   being as the result of these various matters being considered in isolation. Doesn't matter
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.360]   what it is. You take any one of them on its own and isolate it. You're inevitably bound
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.800]   to go wrong. Then the third point I would lay down, the third rule is this. Whatever
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:53.560]   we may think of any individual item or any particular part, must always be consistent
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:01.240]   with what is taught by the other parts, but above all, it must be consistent and compatible
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:08.040]   with the whole. Now, another way I could put that is to put it like this. We must always
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:14.920]   be careful to compare scripture with scripture. This is one of the first rules of exposition.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.880]   Heresies have come into being because people have fixed on a particular statement and have
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.960]   elaborated a doctrine on that without taking the trouble to see that it contradicts other
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:35.320]   statements in the scripture. You must always compare scripture with scripture. Each part
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   must be consistent with the other parts and with the whole. In other words, there must
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:51.160]   never be any contradiction. There isn't any contradiction in truth. All the parts of truth
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.920]   form an harmonious whole. All the parts of the body do the same thing. There is no contradiction
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:04.360]   between hand and foot or any other individual parts of the body. So I say we must be very
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:13.640]   careful that if we are interpreting one aspect or one facet of truth, we must be very careful
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:20.920]   that the conclusions at which we arrive in our dogmatic teaching does not contradict
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.000]   either some other aspect or the whole. Now, there are examples of this that I can give
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.760]   you. I may have told you, I can't recall, of a case I remember reading about years ago
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.440]   of a woman in the early Middle Ages, if I remember rightly, a very godly woman, a very
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:47.880]   devout woman, and a woman whose chief ambition in life was to know God and to serve him.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:53.000]   Now this woman believed, of course, in service. She didn't believe in theoretical Christianity.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.840]   You had to do something. You put your faith into practice and into operation. And she,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:09.160]   being open to the call of God, became convinced that she must leave her husband and her children
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:19.800]   and her home and go and engage in whole-time service for God. And she was sincere enough and
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.160]   honest enough to put this into practice. And the record tells us of how, as she was leaving
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.920]   home and could hear the wailing and the weeping and the agony of her little children, it was to
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:39.400]   her a great confirmation that she was following the will of God. She was ready to sacrifice even
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   this. Now, what was the trouble in a case like that? Well, you see, the real trouble in a case
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:51.800]   like that is this, that here is a woman who, because of her interest in one aspect,
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:59.720]   forgets the other teaching of the Scripture. What is the prime duty of a mother? Well,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:06.360]   it is to look after her family, to look after her children. It is God who has ordained this.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.400]   It is God who made women that she might be a helpmate to men, that they might become one flesh,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.800]   that they might have children, and that children might be brought up in the nurture and the
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.720]   admonition of the Lord. That is her function. It is a great one, a glorious one, there is nothing
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.800]   greater. That is what God has called this woman to do. But you see, through concentration and other
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.360]   aspects, she had become persuaded of this. She does not realize she is even contradicting one
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.920]   of the fundamental laws of nature and of society. It never occurred to her. Now, that is a very
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.200]   extreme instance, but it is only one. I can give you a more modern instance.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:54.280]   I remember hearing of a lady who used to go around addressing sisterhoods, gatherings,
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:03.560]   and meetings of women. And she was telling someone how she was so concerned about this,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.240]   that she had been doing it for a number of years and so on, that her mother had died and her father
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:17.160]   had come to live with her. But now this constituted a difficulty. She did not like this idea of
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.960]   leaving her father. He was not really in a fit condition to be left like that. He needed care
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:28.120]   and attention. So the fact that her father had had to come to live with her and her husband
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.560]   was hindering her ministry, her work. So what she did was to put her father into a home,
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.120]   in order that she might be free to go around lecturing and preaching and speaking.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.760]   That is exactly the same thing again. Exactly the same thing.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:50.520]   God does not do things like that. Children are to care for their parents. I cannot believe that
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.240]   it is well-pleasing in the sight of God that a man like that should be deprived of the loving care
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:03.320]   that his own daughter can give him and her husband, and be hushed, as it were, into a home
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.400]   or a nursing home or wherever you may put it. These things belong to nature. The natural man
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.360]   knows this kind of thing. But Christian people sometimes can persuade themselves,
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.040]   and they will act even contrary to nature, and the fundamental principles of biblical teaching
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.240]   and of life itself on the broadest level. Now, this is the sort of thing we must never do.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.680]   You see, there is a lack of tenancy, there is a lopsidedness. And indeed,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.360]   there are other extreme cases of this. You have heard of people
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.960]   who, because of what they regard as their loyalty to the truth,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:47.880]   refuse to have meals with their own children or children with their parents in the same house.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:54.040]   And this is just another example of the same thing. They think they are doing it because
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.720]   they are spiritual, because they are loyal to the truth. But actually, it is a blank contradiction
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.280]   of the teaching of the scriptures, where we are told that the family is a fundamental unit,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.680]   and that there is to be no such division. Of course, there are things which Christians
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   and non-Christians can't do together in the same family. But they are nowhere told not to sit and
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.280]   eat together, and to do things that the family does in common together. Now, this is the kind
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:31.800]   of imbalance, lopsidedness, that comes in because people take one doctrine or truth in isolation,
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:39.160]   and fail to see that it doesn't contradict some other equally plain, clear teaching.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:46.200]   And that in any case, it is not consistent with the whole. There is ample instruction in the
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.600]   scripture as to what we are to do with those who are not Christians. Our desire should be to win
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:16:00.120]   them and to help them in all ways that we can. And it is here a farce. You remember, our Lord
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:07.640]   himself criticizes the Pharisees for that also, that idea of saying "Corban", because the thing
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.480]   was now dedicated to the Lord, that they could neglect their obvious primary duties with regard
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:19.240]   to their parents. Our Lord even condemns that. And yet, you see, good people, sincere, I'm not
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.840]   doubting their sincerity. What I'm showing is that if once you fix on a particular thing,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:31.640]   mint or anise or cumin or question of eating meats, whatever it is, the moment you get so
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.400]   concentrated on that, and don't compare your scripture with scripture, and maintain your
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.760]   balance, that is the kind of appalling error in which you can end, quite honestly and quite
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:47.400]   sincerely. But you're actually contradicting not only the Christian teaching, but the whole
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:54.680]   general teaching of the scripture, and what is even sometimes a fundamental law of nature itself.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:00.360]   Very well. So I go on to the fourth rule which I would lay down, which would be this.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:13.800]   We must never so emphasize a part as to make it all-important and place it at the center.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:21.320]   Parts are not to be found at the center. They have their place, they have their position.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.000]   But it's never central. Something else is central.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:33.720]   In other words, a part must never be so emphasized or concentrated upon that it detracts from the
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.280]   glory of the center, the big thing. You see, it comes out in the way Paul puts this here. I say
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.200]   there's sarcasm here. "The kingdom of God," he says, "is not meat and drink." They were making
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.920]   it central. It was the big thing, the kingdom of God had gone out of sight. This has become central.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:57.480]   No, parts must never be made central. This is how you see he's now lifting up this whole
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.280]   argumentation and showing them how the divisions that were coming into the Church of Rome over
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:10.600]   these matters were guilty of really doing this fight, in a sense, of a very grave disservice
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.400]   to the kingdom of God itself. This has become virtually the kingdom of God.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.840]   Well, those are the four general rules I would lay down, looking at it from that aspect. But
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.920]   let's look at it from another aspect for a moment. It's the same general point, only that I want to
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.600]   look at it in a different way. Look at ourselves now. There we've been looking at our handling
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.680]   of the truth. But let's look at ourselves, and I put the same principle in this way with regard to
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:51.240]   us. We must never allow only parts of ourselves to be involved in the truth and in these matters.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:59.560]   Let me show you what I mean. As it is wrong for me to concentrate on particular parts or portions
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:07.480]   or aspects of the truth, so it is wrong for the truth to be engaged with only parts or portions
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:15.800]   of me. What do I mean? Well, I mean this. It is my mind only that has to be involved and engaged
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:23.400]   in the truth. My mind must be engaged, but not only my mind. You see, you can work this out,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:31.960]   can't you? Is there anything more dangerous than a theoretical Christianity, a purely intellectual
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:38.120]   interest, concern about propositions and giving a cent to them, defending the faith perhaps?
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:48.200]   But only a mind is involved. How often has that led to antinomianism? How often has it led to
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:56.360]   barrenness and dryness and coldness and hardness in the life and in the ministry? It's simply
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.520]   because all the attention was in the life and everything else had been forgotten. A theoretical
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:09.480]   kind of discipleship and of Christianity. But remember, it is equally wrong to have the heart
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:17.880]   alone engaged. And oh, how many there are of whom that is guilty. They can't be bothered with truth.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.960]   They don't want it. There are many Christian people today in our churches who do not want
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:31.080]   to be taught. They want to be entertained. They object to teaching. They say so, and they
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.360]   criticize ministers who are trying to teach them. They don't want this. They say they want something
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.400]   from the heart. They can't be bothered. It demands too much effort on their part. They don't read.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.720]   They read snippets, digests. They won't read solid books. They don't believe in doing this.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.480]   Now, this is a terrible thing. There's such a glorious truth and so much available for us.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   But these people don't want it. All they want is something to give them a nice feeling,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.320]   or to make them happier, to give them some thrill, as they say.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.400]   You apply this to what has been happening so much since the last war.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:13.000]   Christian people wanting entertainment, enjoyment, copying the methods of the world,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.760]   and increasingly giving less and less content and understanding to their idea of the Christian
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.600]   position. And then there are others, you see, who put the whole of their emphasis upon the will.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:33.560]   These are the people who do things, the activists. And they can be quite heartless sometimes.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.640]   Very good, very active workers. People will do anything. But they not only have no understanding,
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:45.320]   some of them, they've got no feeling either, it seems to me. And it's all a matter of duty and
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.520]   of doing things, and they're busy. As our Lord says about the Pharisees, "They'll come to see
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:58.440]   and lend." Tremendous workers, tremendous activity. But if you come and ask them for a reason for the
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.600]   hope that is in them, they can't give it to you. And as I say, often there is a coldness and a
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:12.040]   hardness, something mechanical, about their great and bustling activity. Well, this is the other way
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.760]   of looking round at this. And the answer to all this is, this isn't the kingdom of God.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   The kingdom of God doesn't only take up a part of the men, it takes up the whole men. That's the
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:31.880]   glory of it. That's where you see its greatness. So that this partial interest from our side,
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:40.280]   or this partial engagement, is equally reprehensible. And as I say, is equally dangerous.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:46.200]   Very well, what do we do about all this? Here are the dangers. I've started with the dangers,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.040]   because the apostle does. He says, "For the kingdom of God is not."
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:57.080]   It isn't this and that. He's been having to work this out in detail, as we've seen. But now he
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:04.120]   comes to this great and grand corrective that he puts before them. And the way in which you correct
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:10.600]   all these tendencies, and surely we have observed these tendencies in ourselves. Some of us are more
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.520]   prone to one than another. But every one of us has failed at this point. And you've got to be watching
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   yourself constantly. I may take occasion later to tell you partially how to do this correction.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.400]   Let me say this much in passing to indicate the kind of thing I mean. For some of us,
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.800]   nothing is more important than that we should order and control our reading properly. Balance
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.880]   your reading. If you don't, you'll soon be in trouble. Balance your reading. That's why I said
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   what I said just now about Archibald Alexander. What I always like about that man is every part
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:54.040]   of him was involved. The whole man was there. It wasn't only academic knowledge and understanding.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.600]   There was feeling, there was warmth, compassion. And at the same time, his will was engaged.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.680]   Very well. What is the grand corrective to all this? Well, it is, as the apostle says,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.320]   to remember that we are really concerned about the kingdom of God.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.880]   That's the thing that matters. But of course, here, as I was indicating at the beginning
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.800]   last Friday night, is the whole difficulty. We miss the wood because of the trees.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.880]   We miss the whole object of the law, as the Pharisees did, because we're interested in
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.480]   the minutiae and the details and the particularities. This is always the danger.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.040]   Now, the thing to do, says Paul, is come back to the center. What's it all about?
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:45.080]   Keep this in the middle. Start always with centralities. Start always with that which
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:53.720]   gives being to everything else. And remember that every part and portion must always be considered
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.840]   in the light of this. Never allow your interest in a part to become so great that you've forgotten
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:05.240]   where it came from. That's the sort of thing we can do, isn't it? You get so detached from
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:11.080]   the point at which you began that you've even forgotten it. Here's something I could illustrate
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:18.600]   very simply from church history. I've quoted you before a statement which I once read many
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.720]   years ago in a little book on Protestantism. Its first sentence, I've never forgotten it.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.560]   "Every institution tends to produce its opposite." He was writing on Protestantism,
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.080]   and what he was able to show so simply was that most of the Protestant churches today have
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.360]   forgotten their origin. They've gone along point after point so that they're saying the exact
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.280]   opposite of what the Protestant reformers said. Isn't that what we are faced with at this moment?
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.480]   All this talk about linking up with Rome, it's because people have forgotten where Protestantism
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.600]   is. They've become immersed in details. They've forgotten the point of origin. They've forgotten
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.960]   the center. This is always fatal. We must always be going out of our way to remind ourselves of
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.800]   the center, the origin, the fount, the source. And all that we consider must always be brought
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   into relationship with this, never in isolation. So that now then this is the great question.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:23.000]   What is the kingdom of God? He says, "It isn't this." What is it? Well, you've got to start,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.920]   of course, by reminding yourself of what the kingdom of God is in general.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:37.240]   This is the great theme of the Bible. The Bible ultimately is concerned about the kingdom of God.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:43.560]   God made the world and made men, set him in it. Men was meant to live a life of communion with
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:49.320]   God, yes, and of obedience with God. And all our troubles have come out of the fact that men
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   rebelled against God and disobeyed him. And therefore, the whole message of the Bible is
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:02.200]   the restoration, if you like, of the kingdom of God. It's the great theme of the Bible from
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:09.560]   beginning to end. And of course, it is in particular, as you know, the theme of our Lord's
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:17.960]   own preaching. How often do we forget this? Do you remember what we are told in Mark 1, verse 15?
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:26.360]   Verse 14, "Now after that John was put into prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:33.800]   the kingdom of God, and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   Repent ye, and believe the gospel.'" The kingdom of God. And it was his theme, as you remember,
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.280]   take all those parables of his, recorded in the 13th chapter of Matthew's gospel,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.800]   parables of the kingdom. The kingdom of heaven is like unto this, a man that goes out and sows his
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:59.080]   seed. It's like a man stumbling suddenly across that treasure, and all the rest of it. Parables
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:05.240]   of the kingdom. He was always talking about the kingdom of God. It was his leading theme.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:11.320]   We tend to forget this, don't we? You see, we've put so much emphasis upon the subjective
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:17.480]   experience, personal salvation. It's the wrong way around, my friends. We should start with the
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.720]   kingdom of God, for it is what he preached about. And all that happens to us, happens to us in order
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.920]   to make us citizens of that kingdom. That's the way to look at it. But you see, this is the whole
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.720]   error, isn't it? Always start with, "I want this, that, and the other." But you mustn't do that.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.480]   You start with what God has done, God's plan and purpose, and it is this kingdom
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.960]   that he has established. But what does the kingdom of God mean, then? Well, what the kingdom of God
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:52.040]   means, it follows of necessity from what I've just been saying. It means the rule of God,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:29:02.280]   the reign of God. That's what the kingdom of God means. He is rule, he is reign. And he does this
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:08.200]   through the word, the word that he's given, and through the spirit. But the center, of course,
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:17.320]   is always the Lord Jesus Christ. For he is the king. The Father has given him this kingdom,
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   and he is the king. Now, he was, our Lord himself, puts this in many interesting ways.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.040]   One which always seems to me to be very notable, because it puts it very clearly,
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.880]   is the one that is recorded in the 11th chapter of the gospel according to Saint Luke.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   Our Lord had been casting out a devil, and heresies and others suggested that he was doing
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:50.920]   so by the power of Beelzebub. And this is his reply. "If I by Beelzebub cast out devils,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.880]   by whom do you, O sons, cast them out? Therefore shall they be your judges." Now, verse 20. "But
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:03.320]   if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:11.480]   That's it. It is the rule of God, the authority of God, and the exercise of this. This is God
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:17.400]   ruling, reigning, commanding, making his will operative. And it's happening supremely
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:24.920]   in the Lord Jesus Christ. You can't have a kingdom without a king. And he is the king.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:33.800]   And the kingdom has been handed to him. And he has done all that he has done in order that this
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.240]   kingdom might be manifested ultimately in all its glorious fullness.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:49.960]   Now, in the Old Testament, this kingdom of God was seen in the nation of Israel.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:56.680]   They were God's people. They were a kingdom of priests, as they were told, you remember,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:03.880]   at Mount Sinai. So the kingdom of God took that external form of the nation of Israel
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:10.840]   under the Old Testament dispensation. The form which the kingdom of God takes now
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:18.360]   is the Christian church. This is the new form. Our Lord, you remember, said towards the end of
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:24.040]   his life to the Jews, to the Pharisees and others, the leaders, it's true of the whole nation,
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:31.320]   the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bearing forth the fruits thereof.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:39.560]   A most important statement. So that the kingdom of God is now to be seen in this visible form
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:45.240]   in the Christian church. But the teaching is equally clear and explicit
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:53.960]   that the kingdom of God is again to be seen in a visible form, in a still more marvelous
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:00.120]   and glorious manner. And that will happen when our Lord comes back again into this world.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.600]   That is this great teaching about the second coming of our Lord, when he will come riding
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.520]   the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels, and he will judge the world in righteousness,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:18.120]   and he will destroy his every enemy, and he will cast them all to the lake of destruction.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.680]   And then his kingdom will be universal, and the shout will be heard, "The kingdoms of this world
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:32.600]   have become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ. Jesus shall reign wherever the sun doth
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:39.880]   his successive journeys run. His kingdom stretched from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:48.840]   wane, no more." That will be the end, you see. That is the end, as Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:55.560]   Every rule and authority and power shall have been set down. The kingdom shall be fully established
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:02.600]   everywhere, and then the sun will hand it back to the Father, and God shall be all and in all.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:10.280]   Well, you know what? This is the general teaching of the Bible concerning the kingdom of God. Now
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.920]   this is the thing, you see, we must never forget. It's because we forget that we get into trouble
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:20.120]   with our subjectivities, and with our little legalisms, and with our emphasis. We've forgotten
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.400]   this. And because we forget it, we don't preach it, and the people don't know about it. And they
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.800]   come to the Christian churches, they go to the cults, wanting this, that, or the other. And all
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.120]   our attention is on these particularities. And we've forgotten the kingdom of God. A man says,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.160]   "I'm happy." Yes, all right, but you may be happy, and yet outside the kingdom of God. The question
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.600]   for you is, are you in the kingdom of God? This is the thing that's going to matter. Nothing else
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:53.080]   will matter, except this glorious kingdom of God and his Christ. But in order to make this plain
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:34:02.840]   and clear, we've also got to emphasize this, that the kingdom of God is also within every one of us
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:10.680]   who is a Christian. It is the rule of God. It is the reign of God. The reign of Christ. He is the
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:15.480]   mediator, and he's the king of the kingdom for the time being. It's the mediatorial kingdom now.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:21.880]   And wherever he reigns in a human heart, the kingdom of God is there. In that sense, the kingdom
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:29.640]   of God is within us, all of us who are Christians. And we mustn't forget that, because we must always
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:35.320]   think of ourselves like that. I mustn't ask myself primarily, as I say, "Am I happy?" Oh no, what I've
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:41.560]   got to remind myself of is that he's my taking, and that he dwells within me. Christ is in me,
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:48.120]   as well as my being in him. And this is the thing that should be of great concern to me,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.000]   not for the meat and drink and observation of days, or this, that, or the other, but the king,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.840]   is he enthroned in my heart? Am I aware of this relationship? You see, it's the failure to do
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:05.880]   this that leads to all these troubles. That's what the apostle is really saying. And to make it quite
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:13.160]   complete again, and this is something very glorious, let's remind ourselves of it. It's a
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:20.520]   great sense of comfort in times like these, isn't it? The kingdom of God, I say, is in you,
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:31.640]   because Christ is in you. But a great day is coming, when you and I will have a very great
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:37.160]   and exalted place in this kingdom. And it's when you begin to think of things like this,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.240]   that you can understand the apostle's sarcasm when he talks about meat and drink.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:51.560]   How pathetic it is. How we rob ourselves of the most wonderful things in the Christian faith,
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:57.080]   and the greatest glories, with the minutiae that engage us. Do you know, my friend,
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:05.800]   there is a day coming when you and I will be reigning in this kingdom. Do you remember how
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.000]   our Lord puts it in that third parable in Matthew 25? Let me read it to you.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.200]   He says, "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.920]   then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations,
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.320]   and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.040]   And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. Then shall the King
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:39.960]   say unto them on his right hand, Come ye, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:46.680]   from the foundation of the world." You are kingdom. Inherit the kingdom that has been prepared for you
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   before the foundation of the world. Or if you prefer it in the way that the apostle Paul puts
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:01.000]   it. And again you see, he does exactly the same thing as he's doing here in Romans 14 in 1 Corinthians
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.560]   6. Here you see these members of the church at Corinth. They've, "Doth any dare any of you having
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:13.640]   a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints?" They were
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.040]   having their quarrels in the church at Corinth. And not only that, they were taking them before
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:24.280]   the public tribunals. And do you know how Paul deals with that? He doesn't so much reprimand
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.760]   them as show them what other fools they are. And how they're failing to remember the kingdom
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.640]   to which they belong and what's going to happen to them. This is how he deals with it. "Do ye not
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:42.440]   know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:50.120]   to judge the smallest matters? Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? How much more things that
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.720]   pertain to this life." See what he's saying is this. Where's your sense of perspective? Where's
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:00.840]   your sense of proportion? Where's your sense of balance? Don't you realize who you are and what
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:06.440]   you are? You're behaving as if you still belong to the world. Listen, he says, "This is what is
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:13.800]   true of you and what is going to be true of you." Now that's the argument. The kingdom of God.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:20.520]   And this is the first and the greatest and the fundamental thing.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:28.680]   Now I'm sorry we've got to leave it at that again for this evening. But you start with that.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.760]   Then all you do and all your thinking and everything else must be governed by that.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.640]   The moment it isn't, you'll go off at a tangent. And you'll be making peripheral things central.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.520]   And you'll be making yourself miserable. You'll be dividing the church. You'll produce chaos and
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   havoc. And you will be doing harm to the kingdom of God. That's what he's saying. And it remains
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:01.240]   for us to work these things out in detail, God willing. And next Friday night we will now be able
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:07.640]   to start with our application of this. But there it is. Start with the kingdom of God. All this is
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:14.600]   about the kingdom of God. You are in it and it's in you. That's going to be the end of it. Very well.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.480]   We start there and we'll work it out together. Let us pray.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:25.400]   O Lord, our God, we come to thee with shame,
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   realizing not only our smallness but our folly, seeing how foolish our wisdom is,
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:43.720]   and acknowledging that we have no excuse to offer. For thy word has taught us and has warned us
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:52.040]   and has shown us the true way. O God, have mercy upon us, especially if we,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.360]   by so acting and thinking and behaving, have been a hindrance to another.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.440]   O Lord, we remember the words of thy dear son,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:08.280]   warning us as he warned the people of that time, if they should be a hindrance
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.320]   to any one of those little ones that believed in him. We remember how he said that it were better
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.760]   for us that a millstone were hanged about our neck and we were cast into the depth of the sea,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:26.840]   than that we should be a hindrance or an obstacle to one of these little ones.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:36.040]   O Lord, have mercy upon us all, for we have all sinned in this respect. Make us wise, we pray thee,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:45.400]   unto the kingdom of God and our place in it and the relative importance of everything else in this
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:52.280]   kingdom of glory and of God. O Lord, by thy Spirit, we pray thee,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:41:00.120]   enlighten the eyes of our understanding and enable us always to remember that we
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:08.520]   have the mind of Christ. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God,
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:16.120]   the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:23.960]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:35.080]   we shall see the King in his glory and inherit the kingdom prepared for us before the foundation
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:42.360]   of the world. Amen. We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd
