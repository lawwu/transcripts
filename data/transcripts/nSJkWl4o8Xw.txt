[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760]   - Is there a way you structure your day
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.720]   or your workflow to be more productive?
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.320]   - I have a, I have a personal assistant.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.120]   So she makes me do a lot of things that are important.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.280]   So actually let's talk about hacking real quick, right?
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920]   Like the idea of like, you know, card, credit card hacking
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.240]   or travel hacking or, you know, house hacking.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.440]   Let's talk about self-discipline hacking.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.040]   I have zero self-discipline, almost none.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.960]   Like if there's a cookie on the counter, I will eat it.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   If there is a, if there is a meeting I can skip,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.720]   I will skip it.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.400]   If there is anything I need to do, I will let myself down.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.820]   I will lie to myself.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.240]   I will disappoint myself all day long.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.760]   As a result, I'm really bad at getting things done.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.680]   So I've had to hack my way into being productive
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.760]   and being efficient.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.960]   I'll give you a couple of examples.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.120]   One, I hire a personal assistant.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.760]   So Jane, who's my assistant right now, Jane's awesome.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.080]   Jane makes sure that I do the most important things
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.920]   and will yell at me.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.080]   And I tell her like she has permission
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.400]   to like force me to do things.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.000]   And there's ways to do it, right?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.580]   For example, the massage I mentioned earlier,
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.160]   I'm getting them, I get a massage once a week.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.440]   I don't get a massage because it feels good.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.520]   I mean, yes, it feels good, right?
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.060]   Like massages are fun.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.320]   I get a massage because I know the most important thing
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.480]   as an entrepreneur that I can do
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.300]   is have uninterrupted thinking time every week.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.260]   But I don't do it, like I won't do it.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.360]   I will write that, I'll put on my calendar, you know,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.500]   go sit at the beach and go think for an hour and a half
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.080]   or just process, journal, I won't do it.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.320]   'Cause I lie to myself and I disappoint myself all the time.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.000]   But when Adriana, my Brazilian masseuse,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.680]   shows up in my driveway and she's pulling behind
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.440]   this giant massage chair, well, now I'm gonna do it, right?
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.600]   I'm now, 'cause I've now obligated myself to somebody else.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.640]   So then I go and get an hour and a half long massage.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.700]   And most of the best ideas and problem solving I've had
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.080]   are during that massage.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.800]   So a massage is simply a way that I have hacked
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.540]   my lack of self-discipline to do the things
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.380]   that I wanna do.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.760]   I hire a personal trainer to come to my house to work out.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.380]   I do the food thing, like you said.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.200]   I have somebody now helping with the kids
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.100]   so that I can do other things.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.600]   I align my life so that way I am obligated to do the things
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   that I know I need to do,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.000]   but lack the self-discipline to get it done.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.080]   I even have like accountability groups,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.840]   like mastermind groups that we meet every week
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.040]   and go through our goals.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360]   All this is designed to get me to just do something
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   'cause I'm so darn lazy.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.160]   Let me just throw out a couple more ideas
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.920]   in case people are interested in more ways
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.080]   they can kind of hack their laziness
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   or their self-discipline.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   One of them, I am a big believer in like checking boxes.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   Maybe I can, there's a great, the Seinfeld strategy.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.120]   Let's talk about this one.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.800]   Seinfeld has this quote from years ago.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.620]   It's probably made up.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.980]   It's probably one of those like Abe Lincoln said it
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.960]   kind of things, but where he said,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.080]   "Every day he writes one joke.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.160]   And when he's done with the joke,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.080]   he puts a big check mark on like a spreadsheet
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.040]   or something like that.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.880]   And after a while,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.240]   you start getting a lot of check marks in a row."
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.560]   And so his advice to this up-and-coming comedian he gave
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.200]   was don't break the chain of check marks.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.560]   Just don't break the chain.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880]   So I'm a bigger believer of doing little tiny actions
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.760]   over and over and over and over,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.640]   and then putting them on a checklist.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.760]   Like that's why I said I have a checklist
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   inside my bathroom mirror
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.520]   for some of our relationship habits.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.120]   But I do it in my journal every single morning.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.200]   So for example, like read one page.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.520]   I can read one page.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.140]   Or I can, I'm really bad at flossing, right?
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.780]   So like, I'll be like, I'm gonna floss.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.080]   Like these are things, now I'm not good at it,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.600]   but because I'm tracking it now,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.040]   and because I have an accountability group
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.160]   that looks at my tracking,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.600]   I've now, like I would look stupid if I showed up
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.840]   and was like, "Yeah, well, I said I was gonna eat healthy
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.000]   all week, but I just ate, you know,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.360]   Cheetos and Mai Tais all week."
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.280]   Like, I would just look stupid
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.160]   'cause I don't wanna disappoint my accountability buddies.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.280]   Like the other guys that are like,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.720]   "Hey, we're gonna, you know, build our businesses too."
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.240]   So I don't wanna look bad in front of other people.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   So I will then get that, what do you wanna call it?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.800]   Account, I guess, accountability around them.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.360]   In fact, in my own company, I operate a system called EOS.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.500]   Have you read "Traction"?
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.880]   Gino Wickman's "Traction"?
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   So Gino Wickman has a book called "Traction."
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.760]   It's right here.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.480]   Get a grip on your business.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   It's basically a system for pulling all the different pieces
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.840]   of your business together into one cohesive system.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   And so it's kinda like what I said earlier with the goals.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.160]   You have your big 10-year goal, maybe,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.240]   and a three-year goal, and you track it down
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.480]   to a meeting that you have once a week with your team.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.520]   But in that meeting, I say out loud in that meeting,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   like, "Last week, I said I would do blank, and I blank."
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   Like, "Last week, I said I would call three investors.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.960]   I called two."
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.400]   In other words, I have to fail.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.320]   I have to publicly fail in front of my team
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.560]   if I don't deliver on the thing I said I was going to do.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   So by adding in that piece of the meeting
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.720]   through the book "Traction," again,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.020]   we operate on this kind of system,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.400]   but that piece of the meeting is,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.960]   "I said I would do this. I did this."
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   That holds me accountable,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.720]   because although I will let myself down,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.560]   I don't wanna let my team down, right?
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.440]   I don't wanna let them down.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.720]   So the more I can obligate myself to things,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.480]   the more likely the things get done.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.120]   I mean, at the end of the day,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.480]   you are the results of what you repeatedly do.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   I'm gonna say that again,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.760]   'cause this is like one of the most profound statements.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.640]   I didn't invent it.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   I've heard it said many different times
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.120]   in many different ways.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.760]   You, well, I'll say you get the results
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.640]   of what you repeatedly do.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.040]   You eat chips and nachos and Mai Tais every day,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.600]   you're going to get overweight.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.320]   You jog every single day, you're going to lose weight.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.720]   You spend 15 minutes every day
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.940]   looking into your significant other's eyes,
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.000]   having a real conversation,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.080]   you're going to have a better relationship.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.120]   You avoid them, you're going to have a bad one, right?
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   So we, there are certain things in life
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.760]   that give us the result of life that we want.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.400]   So all we need to do to be successful in anything,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.640]   I really believe this, it's like,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.200]   know where you wanna go,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.480]   know what things are going to get you there.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.040]   And when I say things, I mean the habits,
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.240]   the traits, the systems, whatever.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.920]   So know where you wanna go,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.440]   know the things that are gonna get you there,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.280]   track those things and get accountability on it.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   If it's a group of guys getting accountability together,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.920]   or guys meaning guys or girls,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.400]   or is it hiring a performance coach?
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.840]   Whatever that is, get the accountability.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.360]   So know where you're going,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.480]   figure out what the steps are needed to get there,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.360]   track it so you can be aware
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.840]   of you getting there or not getting there,
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.080]   and then get accountability
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.680]   so you can hack your self-discipline.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.560]   You can accomplish anything, anything by doing that.
