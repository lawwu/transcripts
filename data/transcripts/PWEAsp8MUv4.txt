[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   Next, we're going to talk about the Amex Gold Card.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.400]   And that's a personal card.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.640]   Earns 4x on groceries and 4x on restaurants.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.080]   But the grocery spend has a $25,000 a year cap.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.120]   The restaurant side has a $50,000 a year cap.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.020]   And then it earns 3x on flights, 1x on everything else.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.240]   It does also get 2x on prepaid hotels through Amex Travel.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.480]   But again, I don't really like booking hotels in the travel portal.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.620]   And especially not for one extra point.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.720]   So I'll set that aside.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.160]   But it's a 4x grocery, 4x dining card, 3x flights.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.780]   I really like this card.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.120]   This card is one that I keep in my wallet.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.060]   It is my primary dining and grocery card out there.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.560]   I have other cards for more points on flights.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.100]   But I'm using this a lot.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.420]   The sign-up bonus right now as of recording is as high as it has ever been at 100,000 points.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.380]   For $6,000 of spend in 6 months.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.580]   But for me, this is my primary card that I keep in my wallet.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.240]   Because dining spend seems to be one of the few things that sometimes you need a physical card.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.960]   So it's a primary bias for why I have it in my wallet.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.100]   But I use it all the time.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.780]   It's an S-tier card for me.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.100]   And, you know, I'm really happy with it.
