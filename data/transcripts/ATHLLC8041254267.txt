[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.220]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.560]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.140]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.600]   I'm a diehard optimizer.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.940]   I love doing all the research
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.480]   to help you get the best experience in life without an expensive price tag.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.520]   And today I'm talking to Brandon Turner about real estate.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   And while I do own my primary residence at a fraction of a vacation home,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.900]   I've never really dabbled with rentals, Airbnb's or any residential
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.860]   or commercial real estate projects, except owning some REITs in my investment accounts.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.500]   But Brandon's taken a different path and it's worked out pretty well for him.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.540]   He's a real estate investor with thousands of properties,
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.420]   hundreds of millions under management, and he's also the author
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.500]   of a few real estate books and has sold over a million copies.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.960]   He's also a podcaster with over 100 million downloads,
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.420]   having hosted the BiggerPockets real estate podcast for almost 10 years.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.840]   If you're not familiar with BiggerPockets, it's a massive real estate
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.100]   investing resource with millions of members, tons of content, books, courses and more.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.020]   So I want to use this conversation to do two things.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.780]   First, Brandon is a fascinating person who's very intentional
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.440]   with his mindset on life, work, philanthropy and more.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   So I want to understand how he operates, why he works with a performance coach,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.860]   whether most of us should be doing that, how he's managed to be successful
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.960]   and still prioritize friends, family and the quality of life.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.700]   Did I mention he lives in Hawaii?
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160]   So he's doing something right.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.840]   But I want to start by brushing up my knowledge on real estate
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680]   and learn who should be investing in real estate, whether I'm even on that list,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.600]   how people should get started and ask some of the questions
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.180]   that have been on my mind for years and held me back from doing real estate
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.260]   in the past, fees, overhead, lack of skill.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.720]   So without more delay, Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.400]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.740]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.020]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.440]   for investment decisions.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   Brandon, welcome to the show.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.200]   Dude, that may have been the greatest interview introduction I have ever had.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.440]   So I am psyched to be here.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.320]   There's going to be a lot of fun and excited to talk to you
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.240]   not only about real estate, but can I tell you a quick story
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.360]   about how terrible I am at your world?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.380]   Yeah, I don't even know what my world is.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.880]   The world of like points like that piece of your world
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.160]   like hacking the point thing and the travel thing.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.260]   So I spent half a million dollars on ads on Facebook over the past eight weeks.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.920]   We've been talking about what I was raising for.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.340]   I already know where we're going.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.960]   I didn't use a credit card for it.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.180]   Like, that's how bad this was.
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180]   I think we like hooked up an ACH something or a debit card,
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.440]   like half a million dollars on ads, and I didn't get anything for it.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.860]   Like, I could have probably like flown in a nice plane or something.
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.680]   So I probably have a lot to learn from you.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.820]   Hopefully, I can share at least some with you and your audience.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.940]   Well, for anyone listening, if you're in that situation,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.580]   the Amex business gold and the Chase Inc business
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.200]   preferred are three and four X points on ad spend.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.880]   So, you know, somewhere between one point five and two million points
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   are often the ether.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.040]   So that's yeah, terrible.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.180]   People listening will really feel that pain.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.960]   But yes, hopefully, if you're spending money now,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.220]   you'll be spending money in the future and we can correct that down the road.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.840]   I mean, I don't keep receipts.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.340]   That's something that people are always shocked when they hear.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.680]   I don't keep receipts.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.440]   Like even though I could deduct a lot of the stuff I do,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.820]   I don't do like the whole tax thing.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.820]   Like I go to a business dinner.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.100]   I don't keep the receipt and people think I'm crazy.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.020]   And here's why, though.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.240]   I'm a big believer in like going all in and using all available space
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   in my head for two things, and that is like family.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.480]   And getting stupid rich through real estate, right?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.900]   So those like the two things, if it's not those two things,
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.400]   like I just don't generally get into it.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.900]   And I think that has been one of the things
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.660]   that's let me be successful in those two areas,
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.000]   because I'm only really focusing on two areas and not 50 areas.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.740]   So points and receipts and all that stuff that I should be doing,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.920]   I'm just not doing.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.260]   So maybe I just need like a person in my life to run that part for me.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.540]   But maybe I need to start that company.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.500]   Maybe you do.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.260]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.640]   Do we just make a billion dollar company?
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.880]   Do we just become best friends?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.140]   Oh, all right.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.880]   Let's go back to real estate.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.600]   What do you want to know?
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.100]   What can I tell you?
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.760]   So I'm a pretty thoughtful investor.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.100]   I used to run an investment advisory firm, financial planning firm,
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.900]   and I own my home.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.360]   I own some REITs in my accounts.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.240]   But I see people like you who've done a lot in real estate.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.580]   And I always question whether I'm doing it wrong.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.700]   Is investing in real estate
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.200]   outside of your home something that everyone should be doing?
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.280]   Hmm. All right.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.080]   So the short answer, I would say, yes.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.000]   The more nuanced answer is which way to invest in real estate.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.800]   I think real estate belongs in everybody's portfolio.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.060]   I think that real estate has so many cool things to it.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.640]   It's not the only way to make wealth.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.020]   I mean, stocks, they're great.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.220]   I'm sure like bonds, I don't know, whatever those are,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.220]   like all that stuff works, right?
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.100]   The thing that's cool about real estate is it has so many different ways
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.280]   to make money within it that it can find its way into any person's portfolio.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.660]   So what I mean by that is like I was like 21 years old.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.820]   I'm working at Coldstone Creamery.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.480]   I like dissing ice cream and singing for tips.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.620]   And I think I was actually 19 at this point.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.780]   We're going to Coldstone like 19 singing for tips. Right.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.040]   And I rent an apartment, a four bedroom apartment,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.800]   and I rent out the other three rooms and I just live in the fourth room.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.000]   And all of a sudden I'm like living for free.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.580]   I ended up actually renting out my bedroom and I lived on the couch
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.840]   for half that year and I started making money.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.880]   You can go that extreme.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.720]   That's kind of real estate investing.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.600]   And then on the other side, like I own whatever 7000 rental units
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.740]   and I own a big company that buys apartments and mobile home parks.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.360]   And I just run like a business over there.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.900]   And so you take those two extremes and everything in between
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.660]   involving real estate, you can make money and you can make a lot of money.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.740]   And so, yes, everyone should invest in real estate.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.320]   The question is how and how is it going to work for you?
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.040]   What fires you up? What gets you excited and what's your goals are?
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.920]   So I imagine most of the people listening are not looking
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.840]   to have four roommates and sleep on a couch.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.580]   So we knock off that.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.680]   And I'm guessing that if they're listening to this, trying to learn about real estate,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.180]   they're also not on the other end of trying to figure out
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.300]   how to buy their next 3000 properties.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.340]   So we find somewhere in the middle, someone who maybe they own their home.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.260]   Maybe they've thought about buying a vacation home or a rental home,
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.360]   but they haven't pulled the trigger and they're trying to figure out
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.560]   what's a good way to get into this,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.940]   whether it's just the learning side or the experience through doing.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.320]   Yeah. So one of my favorite ways into real estate,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.440]   especially with those people who don't have a ton of capital to start with.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.540]   Right. Again, going back to why I love real estate.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.700]   Real estate is kind of like any business in that it doesn't necessarily require
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   a lot of money if you use time instead. Right.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.880]   So there's ways to kind of hustle your way into real estate.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.340]   So maybe it's not the living on a couch kind of idea,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.680]   but there's a term we call house hacking.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   This has changed my life.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.640]   House hacking. I've done it many, many times.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.260]   It's where you buy like a small multifamily property.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.220]   Let's call a triplex, like three separate units, right?
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.180]   And they're all over the country, all over the world.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.600]   Every country's got them.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.180]   And you live in one of the units and then you rent the other ones out.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.100]   Now, you don't even have to be the property manager.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.400]   You can even hire management so you don't deal with the tenants.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.280]   But the benefit is, is one, you can get into these deals
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.480]   for very low money down, like three percent, four percent, five percent down
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.700]   when you're willing to live in the property for at least a year.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.960]   So let's just say you're somebody you've saved up 20 grand.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.920]   Well, what's 20 grand really going to do for you? Right.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.500]   You throw it into the
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.720]   stock market and you make yourself 10 percent on your 20 grand. OK, good.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.100]   You're now making two thousand dollars a year.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.940]   Like it's not life changing money.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.520]   But that same 20 grand, if you were to buy that duplex or triplex,
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.100]   you could be living for free and saving what you'd be paying on rent
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.600]   somewhere else.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.020]   You could be saving a thousand, two thousand, three thousand dollars a month
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.700]   and building equity at the same time.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.040]   So that's a cool strategy.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.580]   And a lot of people like, well, I don't want to live in a crappy duplex.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.660]   So I live in Hawaii.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.920]   I have an ocean view.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   My house is worth about three million dollars.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.880]   I got a pool.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.080]   I got this crazy cool property here.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.220]   It's a triplex.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.640]   I rent out the back unit that pays almost half my mortgage.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.060]   And if I wanted to rent out the other unit that I have, I could.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.600]   And I would pay my whole mortgage.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.300]   I'd be living for free in Maui, looking at the ocean because of house hacking.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.980]   So it's not just for people who are starting out.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.400]   It's just a cool strategy in general.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.940]   A cool hack. Again, house hacking.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.780]   And you're the hack guy. So there you go.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.900]   I actually ended up doing this without realizing it about a decade ago
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.080]   because we were trying to buy a home and we kept struggling with the fact that
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.280]   if you buy a two bedroom home and you're going to start a family,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.320]   you're going to outgrow that home.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.900]   Yeah. And like the traditional advice when you buy a home,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.200]   you pay real estate agent fees or someone does.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.280]   And when you sell the home, the same thing and closing costs
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.320]   and furnishing and staging and all this stuff.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.540]   So the general rule is like, if you're not going to live there
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.960]   for a long time or own it for a really long time,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.160]   the transaction costs are going to eat you up.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.380]   So we're like, well, we can't buy a place that's two bedrooms
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.260]   because we're going to move out.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.800]   And so we found a place with three bedrooms,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.340]   with one of the bedrooms having a door to the outside.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.680]   And we said, great, we'll turn that bedroom into a studio.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.920]   And for the next five years, while we don't need three bedrooms,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.220]   we're going to rent it.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.220]   Real estate in San Francisco did so well that it ended up paying the whole mortgage.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.900]   And then when we finally had our first child, we said, oh, we need the space.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.520]   We were done with tenants.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.640]   And now we have a three bedroom. We didn't have to buy and sell.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.600]   So that was our version.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.400]   I didn't know there was a house hacking movement.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.740]   Now, I met this guy from the Investor's Podcast Network, Robert Leonard.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.660]   He wrote a book about house hacking recently.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.160]   So now it's become this thing. At the time,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.320]   it was just a way that I could subsidize the cost of my mortgage.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.540]   You know, it's funny about this.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.280]   So the word house hacking.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.840]   So I coined that and I'm not trying to just pat myself on the back.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.080]   I was the first one to coin that years and years ago, like 10 years ago.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.880]   You can go back to the original article I wrote on it.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   The reason that I coined that was based on travel hacking
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.220]   because everyone talked about travel hacking.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.420]   And I was like, well, I'm kind of doing the same thing
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.840]   when I buy duplexes and live in a house.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.300]   So I call it house hacking just based on that.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.340]   And the term just took off.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.180]   Really, I owe a lot to your world and your industry for that term.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.720]   So really, what I'm saying is we're all here because of you, man.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.020]   Yeah, definitely not because of me.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.600]   But you are here because of me, but not everyone else.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.400]   But I love that story that you just told, right?
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.360]   Because it just illustrates one of the million ways
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.780]   that real estate can change your life or benefit your life in a lot of ways.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.040]   Like, I wouldn't buy a three million dollar house in Hawaii,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.820]   but because I house hack, I can.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.380]   And in fact, there's other cool things like my buddy actually rents for me,
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.800]   which is normally a terrible idea.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.960]   I usually caution against that.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.340]   But my buddy rents for me because he's back there.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.260]   We started this company together to buy big commercial properties.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.060]   And now we bought whatever, 7000 units because of him being there.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.220]   So it's kind of a cool like the ancillary thing is you kind of get a community vibe,
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.180]   which is sorely missing in America today, right?
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.680]   Like we're all so alone in the world.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.820]   So now I kind of feel like I have my own little compound in a way,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.100]   which is kind of funny, but it works really well.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.020]   One of the key mathematical reasons behind what you just said
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.020]   when house hacking is that you can get leverage and that that leverage,
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.200]   unlike the leverage in a brokerage account, is not subject to a margin call.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   So if house prices go down, you don't get evicted.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.480]   And if you ride it out long enough, you'll be OK.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.200]   So that works really well if you are ready to buy a new place.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.500]   What if you're already in a home and you're not really looking to move out of it?
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.580]   Is getting into real estate, is that just buying the duplex and not living in it?
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.920]   Is it buying a vacation rental property?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.040]   Is that version of it as appealing when you can't live in it
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.720]   and something that the average homeowner should be thinking about
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.040]   as a way to invest their savings?
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.880]   Yeah, 100 percent. Yes, they should look into it.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.460]   That said, most deals aren't deals.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.340]   Most properties are going to lose you money by owning them.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.300]   And so as long as you're willing to learn how to run some simple math,
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.940]   and it's not hard.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.980]   I mean, like you can just go to YouTube and search like rental property math.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.680]   Like it's not super hard to do.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.240]   Now, again, there's different strategies, different strokes for different folks.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.820]   Right. Vacation rentals are a phenomenal way to bring in a lot of profit.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.940]   I got a condo here in Hawaii.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.020]   One condo makes me $7,000 a month in profit.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.080]   One property. Right.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.660]   And I think I paid maybe 150 grand like into it like that.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.080]   I've got into it and it's a million dollar property.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.500]   But like that's a phenomenal return.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.700]   Like that's going to blow the stock market out of the water.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.760]   However, I have to manage that.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.380]   I have an assistant who takes care of it, but like that's still a business
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.760]   basically I have to run.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.880]   So again, there's different things for different people.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.820]   Let me tell you a story that illustrates a couple of points
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.240]   on why I love real estate so much.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.000]   So when my daughter, whose name is Rosie, she's super cute.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.420]   She's six years old now.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.000]   When Rosie was born, literally the week she was born,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.260]   we went and signed papers on a four unit property.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.340]   It was a fourplex located in kind of a rough area.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.560]   Not like I'm going to get shot there, but like definitely not like a place
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.600]   I'd want to live.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.300]   But we got this four unit property there and it was super cheap and disgusting.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.600]   And there was like rats living in it.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.320]   And a bunch of like people had broken in and stolen stuff.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.020]   I mean, it needed a lot of work, but we buy this property and we fix it up.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.740]   And then we put it on an 18 year payoff plan.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.860]   It's a 30 year mortgage, which is pretty typical.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.040]   But I actually went to like Dave Ramsey's like calculator online and was like,
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.960]   how much extra do I have to pay every month to pay it off in 18 years?
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.320]   And it was like one hundred and fifty bucks extra every month.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.740]   So I put it on this 18 year path plan.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.040]   Now, our mortgage at the beginning was one hundred and fifty thousand
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.420]   that I owe in the mortgage.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.460]   When my daughter is 18, we'll owe zero dollars on it.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.000]   Now, that property could make me no money for the next 18 years.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.260]   I can make nothing off of it.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.000]   But at very least, my tenants just paid off a mortgage
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.460]   over the course of 18 years, and now it's worth a lot more money, right?
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.000]   In fact, it's probably worth when I bought it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.080]   Two hundred thousand. My mortgage was one fifty.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.260]   I always said it'd be worth three to four hundred thousand dollars
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.040]   when Rosie's ready to go to college.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.080]   So no, these are two things that play here, right?
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.580]   The property values tend to go up over time.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.040]   Yes, there's dips and such, but based on just three percent
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.120]   appreciation over the next 18 years, it should be worth between three
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.660]   and four hundred thousand dollars.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.080]   We will then owe nothing on it.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.740]   So we've built now three or four hundred thousand dollars of equity
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.780]   that Rosie gets to use for college.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.740]   And this is a plan I tell a lot of parents, buy one rental house
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.420]   when your kids are young, put it on a 15 or 18 year whatever mortgage,
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.000]   whatever it takes to go to college and their college is paid for off one property.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.660]   So that's the loan getting paid down and appreciation.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.660]   Those are two of the four wealth generators of real estate.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.660]   So one of them is appreciation.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.840]   Real estate goes up.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.700]   Number two, real estate gets paid down when you have a mortgage, which is great.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.300]   That's the whole leverage piece.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.580]   Number three, though, is the cash flow.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.580]   This fourplex makes me over fifteen hundred dollars in profit
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.540]   every single month.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.540]   Now, some months a little bit more, some a little less if we have repairs and such.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.420]   And that's after paying the property manager.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.380]   It's like I don't even deal with this property.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.500]   It's maybe a minute every single month.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.220]   So now I've got the third wealth generator is cash flow.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.640]   Now, Rosie doesn't get that.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.880]   I get to have a nicer car because of that, right?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.680]   I can use that for my life.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.800]   And that's why I love cash flow.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.100]   So cash flow is a third reason.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.640]   And the fourth wealth generator of real estate is the tax benefit.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.460]   So when I make fifteen hundred dollars a month on cash flow,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.640]   I pay zero dollars in taxes on that zero dollars in it.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.180]   You make fifteen hundred dollars doing a W2 job, not you, but somebody does.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.520]   And they're going to pay five hundred in taxes, six hundred in taxes, whatever.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.020]   So not only do you have the three areas where you're growing wealthier,
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.520]   but the fourth area is that there's so many tax strategies
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.320]   for real estate investors
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.120]   that you typically will pay little to no tax as long as you invest in real estate.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.280]   So combine those four things together.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.960]   And it's a phenomenal return that I think can blow out any business,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.900]   any investment, any way to generate wealth completely out of the water
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.620]   in terms of both how well it grows and the assuredness of which it grows.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.280]   Now, you can start a business and you'll get 10000 percent return.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.660]   But businesses fail all the time.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.360]   Real estate's fairly stable.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.860]   It would be hard to lose when you buy right and you manage right.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.580]   You said we're going to be friends.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.860]   Maybe this is the pivotal moment here when I push back on a few things.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.360]   So on the tax front, let's go in reverse.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:28.660]   All right.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.580]   The reason I assume you're not paying taxes is because you're depreciating
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.580]   the property.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.580]   That's a huge piece of it. Yes.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.620]   And at some point in the future, when you sell that house,
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.660]   having depreciated the value of it, if you were to sell that property,
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.960]   you would have much more taxes in the future.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.200]   Whereas my W-2 income that I invested, I would only pay on the gains
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.860]   if I went and invested that W-2 income after tax.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.120]   So yes and no.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.580]   But this is why I said, as long as you keep investing in real estate,
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.780]   you pretty much never pay taxes.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.120]   So between a thing called the 10th Irwin Exchange, which is awesome,
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.820]   and between a thing called cost segregation or depreciation,
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.860]   accelerated depreciation, all that stuff.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.780]   And we don't need to go in the weeds on it.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.000]   But essentially, as long as you don't stop investing in real estate,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.820]   it's kind of a treadmill.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820]   I will admit it is a treadmill you get on.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.660]   But what most investors do eventually is they just get more and more
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.980]   passive properties.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.320]   Like they start maybe buying the duplex that they're managing or the fourplex.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.620]   And eventually they sell it and then they buy a share,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.120]   a small piece of a huge shopping mall, and they just hold on to that for life.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.500]   And then when you die, the taxes basically just get wiped out.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.040]   The government says, OK, well, your children aren't going to owe any of that.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.240]   And they wipe it out.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.160]   And so there are ways to pay nothing forever.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.280]   But like you said, there is that.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.740]   That said, on that $1,500, first of all, I don't pay any self-employment tax
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.040]   or any of the 15% that everyone else pays.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.780]   So it's naturally lower anyway.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.000]   But then the depreciation just wipes the rest of it out.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.080]   Even if you did decide, I'm getting off the treadmill,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.300]   I'm selling these properties, you're still paying capital gains on that.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.660]   You're not paying income tax.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.340]   So correct.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.300]   I'll give you that.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.920]   Even in the worst scenario, it's still a better scenario from a tax standpoint.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.180]   But there are future tax liabilities by taking the depreciation.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.040]   Yeah, it's not as easy as just you buy a rental property and pay no taxes ever.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.620]   There's definitely a strategy to it.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.660]   And understanding how this stuff works is important,
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.420]   which is one of the reasons people should not invest in real estate.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.500]   Let me argue why you shouldn't invest in real estate,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.620]   because it is not a button you press on an app.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.080]   Now, there are easier ways to do it right.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.200]   So like I've raised,
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.460]   I don't know, 250 million dollars over the past couple of years
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:32.040]   from investors like you, maybe who like, I don't want to go buy a duplex
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.960]   and deal with the toilets
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.000]   and the tenants and the termites and all that crap, right?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.160]   I don't want the trauma.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.240]   So they just invest with me and then we go and buy it.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.780]   So that's what my company does today is we do something like that.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.660]   And this is not a sales pitch.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.000]   You don't have to go with me. You can go to anybody.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.500]   There's lots of us out there who do this very thing.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.740]   You can still get depreciation.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.660]   You still get some of that stuff,
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.740]   but it's much more of a push button sort of investment.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.080]   Now, your returns are probably lower than if you were renting out
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.460]   all your bedrooms in your house, living on the couch.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.000]   But you pay and you get what you want to put into it.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.920]   Just like really any business.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.620]   One more quick point.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.880]   The other cool thing about the tax depreciation stuff,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.800]   not only are you not paying the 15 percent that everyone else has to pay,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.920]   but I read the numbers one time and it's in one of my books.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.840]   Even if you were to just pay it anyway, at some point,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.880]   just settle up with the government
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.800]   because you deferred it down the road, down the road, down the road.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.960]   Because you are not paying it.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.040]   You are using the government's money next time to buy more.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.380]   So even when you settle up, you are far ahead of where you would have been
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.340]   if you just pay taxes like a normal person.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.220]   Does that make sense? Yeah. You're using their money.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.080]   That's the same logic that goes into tax deferred retirement plans.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.460]   The reason why is that your money can compound before you owe that tax liability.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.760]   I did an episode that we will not get into all about some crazy
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.420]   estate planning tax strategies.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.880]   And part of the reason that those work is that the rates
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.340]   the government thinks things will grow are not the same rates
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.300]   that things actually end up growing in the markets.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.260]   And so if you can defer taxes as long as possible,
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.600]   you can actually get an outsized return, compound interest, et cetera.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.100]   And you briefly brushed on 1031, but I'll say my version of it,
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.560]   which is completely unsophisticated, but maybe that's easier than going down.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.520]   It's just that if you have real estate property that increases in value,
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.340]   you can either realize those gains or you can roll them into another property.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.420]   And defer and defer.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.020]   So as long as you're rolling in the gains from real estate sale
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.980]   to another real estate transaction, you can postpone and postpone.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.680]   You buy a property, make a million bucks, dump it into a new property.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.640]   And the government's going to be like, oh, yeah,
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.600]   I would say it's like the government is like your uncle who's partnering with you.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.820]   They're like, hey, you did a really good job with that investment.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.780]   You made a million bucks.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.440]   Keep our money.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.700]   Just put it in the next deal and then put the next deal.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.480]   The government's going to let you just keep putting in the next deal.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.080]   Now, there's a lot of rules with that, but that's essentially what it is.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.440]   In today's Internet age, people's personal information
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.400]   is being shared online with the click of a button without their consent.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.480]   And it happens all the time.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.940]   But you can tackle this problem thanks to Delete Me from Abine.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.780]   And I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.200]   When I used to Google myself, I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.660]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email, family members and a lot more.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.460]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself, which you can do.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.160]   But after at least 10 hours, I signed up for Delete Me and it was so much easier.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.040]   Their software and team of experts will not just find and remove
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.420]   your personal information from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:27.120]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.680]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes over 2000 pieces of data
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.800]   for a customer in their first two years.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.720]   So if you want to get your personal information removed
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.640]   from search results on the web, go to AllTheHacks.com/DeleteMe
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.440]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.740]   Again, that's AllTheHacks.com/DeleteMe.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.620]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.120]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.880]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.960]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.920]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.380]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.420]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.520]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.680]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.140]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.820]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.860]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.940]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.960]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.920]   on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.300]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.560]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.940]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.940]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly.com.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.860]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.200]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.580]   And then the returns, right?
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.660]   Historical property appreciation is positive,
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.040]   but historical stock market appreciation is more positive.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.540]   Comparing apples to apples, it's like the returns are higher.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.800]   So how do you compare this to I'm going to take all the money I have,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.840]   I'm going to put it in a diverse index funds, including REITs,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.600]   and, you know, we can get to REITs after.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.300]   And instead of paying down this mortgage each month,
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.440]   I'm going to take that cash flow and I'm going to invest it.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.760]   I've said that mortgages are great for people who wouldn't otherwise save
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.720]   because it forces you to.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.980]   But if you're disciplined and you took all that cash flow and saved it,
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.020]   how do you think that compares?
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.280]   You think real estate still wins every time or on average?
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.240]   I think on average it does and it has.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.700]   When you use that leverage, if we're talking apples to apples,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.000]   like you got 100 grand, should you buy a $100,000 property in cash
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.340]   or put $100,000 in the stock market?
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.340]   I would probably put $100,000 in the stock market, honestly,
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.960]   because like when you lose the leverage piece, you lose everything.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.680]   But if you can use the 100 grand to buy 500,000 worth of real estate,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.640]   your $500,000 deal is appreciating at 3% per year.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.520]   So you're getting whatever that is, like way better leverage on it.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.480]   Right. And the loan's getting paid down and you get the tax benefits
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.140]   and you get the cash flow.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.820]   So you kind of combine it all together and the stock market.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.940]   I mean, everyone's got a different number, right?
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.940]   But six to ten, somewhere in that percentage.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.980]   Or if you're Dave Ramsey, 12%, you say.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.120]   But the stock market average is somewhere in that range, right?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.860]   Let's call it seven, 8%.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.540]   I mean, like my real estate, like I don't buy anything
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.360]   that doesn't average me 15% or greater.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.080]   Like I don't buy anything that doesn't do 15%.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.000]   And that's after factoring in all of the crazy costs
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.460]   that come from owning real estate.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.620]   That's the number we what we call underwrite.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.500]   So we underwrite from a 15% per year standpoint
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.540]   when we buy real estate for our investors.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.600]   And we're actually getting more than that.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.140]   We're getting more like 20 to 25%, but we take about a third.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.980]   That's what my company does.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.720]   So we underwrite from a 15% per year for our investors.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.360]   Now for that, right, higher risk, higher return.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.240]   Obviously, like you're trusting some random dude from the Internet
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.980]   to invest your money and hoping you get your 15% per year.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.040]   So it's maybe a little riskier than throw it into GE or Tesla.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.120]   But I don't know. I could actually argue the opposite.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.960]   I mean, what do you think? Let's throw it back at you.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.460]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, dumping in the stocks.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.720]   Definitely when you're talking, dump it into GE or Tesla.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.380]   I feel like I'm with you, right?
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.560]   The volatility of any single stock almost thought you were going to go GM or Tesla.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.520]   And then I was like, well, that's an interesting perspective, right?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.220]   Like one of those two could go very different direction.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.600]   Historically, the challenge for me has been the push the button, right?
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.900]   To buy the real estate, you've got to find the deals.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.020]   You've got to process the deals.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.740]   We had one tenant in a house we lived in, and that even felt like a lot.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.860]   Not because they were there, but because, oh, the sink's not working.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.540]   It just felt like a lot.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.860]   So I think for me, I've always been apprehensive
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.420]   of buying real estate with all of the kind of craziness
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.000]   that comes with managing it and dealing with it.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.740]   If it's not your primary residence and you would know better than me,
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.160]   I feel like the loan situation is harder in terms of you
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.120]   just don't get as favorable terms when you're not buying a primary residence.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.840]   And that's kind of held me back.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.140]   The vacation rental.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.140]   If it's not a long term tenant, then you've got a vacation rental.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.240]   Now you've got to put it on Airbnb or you've got to put it somewhere
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.520]   and manage who's coming and what happens if there's a pandemic
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.620]   and no one wants to travel and all that stuff.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.660]   So for me, it was just so much easier to invest in the markets.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.460]   But that doesn't mean I'm not interested, because then I go, OK, well,
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.680]   then I could just pay someone to do all this for me.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.220]   A company you're starting or anyone else.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.680]   And then I'm like, oh, but then the fees, maybe I should do it myself.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.180]   And I kind of get stuck in this analysis paralysis of I want to do this thing.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.520]   I don't want to do the work, but I don't want to pay someone to do the work.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.720]   OK, I'm just not going to do it.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.300]   And so I ended up just doing REITs.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.800]   So I'm curious where you think REITs fall on the spectrum.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.000]   Is that a form of real estate investing or do you kind of say, no, no, no,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.040]   that's like the stock market version.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.340]   Let's leave that aside.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.640]   It is a stock market version.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.440]   REITs typically have a very similar return as the regular stock market.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.780]   Right. Depends again, which REIT and which ones you're looking at
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.240]   and how you're measuring it.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.180]   You can manipulate data all you want, but typically it's not a whole lot better
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.080]   and maybe even worse than traditional just stock market investing.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.660]   But REITs are great. REITs are a push a button.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.460]   They are the stock market for real estate.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.200]   You're typically buying a large A class, real nice
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.020]   like apartment complexes or shopping malls or whatever.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.500]   And you're combining your money with lots of other people.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.100]   And they're just very stable.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.240]   You're not doing anything fancy.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.440]   You're not really having to work at all at it.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.280]   Now, what we do so at Opendoor Capital, which is my company.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.640]   And again, there's lots of us out there that do this.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.100]   It's a similar model.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.680]   You wire the money to us, you push your button and you're pretty much done.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.420]   The way that we're different is we're actively investing.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.700]   Like we're not buying super A class shopping malls for three billion dollars
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.100]   and getting 10,000 investors all chipping their money on it or 10 million investors.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.940]   We're typically 100 investors coming together, pulling our money,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.240]   and we split profits a little different.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.600]   So we just basically take the first seven or 8%.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.400]   Like we always assume, like if we're not going to get you
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.040]   at least a stock market return, then I shouldn't get paid.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.740]   So the first seven or 8% goes right to our investors.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.720]   Like you would get the first seven or 8% per year return.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.620]   Anything above that, we then split.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.880]   So typically it's like a 70/30.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.420]   So I would take 30% of anything above your average stock market return,
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.660]   and then you would get 70% of that.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.760]   And then at some point, it might shift also to what's called a 50/50.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.160]   At some point, if we blow it out of the water and do exceptionally good,
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.040]   that's our kind of like hope is that we get a 50% return for investors
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.200]   so that we make more money and that everybody wins.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.560]   But yeah, so I guess the point being there are ways to invest
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.200]   completely passively into real estate, whether it's a REIT or a company
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.780]   like Fundrise, which is kind of a middle ground between a REIT and what I do,
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.620]   or whether you're investing in a person you trust and know from the Internet
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.380]   or from a meetup group or whatever.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.780]   That's why and because of that, I'll even make this point.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.820]   Most rich people, when I say rich, I mean, like you have disposable income
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.220]   in a significant amount of way, should not invest in real estate,
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.100]   like actively, because at the end of the day, you go out there,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.260]   you buy a rental house, right?
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.200]   You're a month in.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.460]   You're sitting at the dinner table with your family.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.300]   You're asking your kids these questions about that.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.100]   And then your phone rings, right?
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.040]   You pick up your phone and they're like, oh, yeah, my toilet's not working tonight.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.480]   And you say those like four most dreaded words of every landlord and family,
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.440]   which is I'll be right over like I'll be right over. Right.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.780]   So now you're leaving your family.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:26.920]   You're driving over there.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.940]   You fix the toilet.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.820]   You come back home a week later.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.420]   The stove's not working right.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.220]   And then they didn't pay rent three months later.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.280]   And now you've got to evict them.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.520]   And so if you were to look at the average person who buys real estate
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.020]   like out there, that doesn't love it.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.320]   They're just trying to buy real estate and they're putting a bunch of their money
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:45.960]   into it.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.100]   I would argue you'd get a better return investing with a company like mine
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.400]   or Fundrise or maybe even a REIT, then you're going to get on your own.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.840]   Because when you average in all those costs
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.100]   of owning a rental property, they add up.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.580]   Now, over time, if you're fired up, if you want to be good at landlording,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.280]   you want to be good at this stuff, you want to manage your own properties
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.140]   and you like it.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.220]   Yeah, you can make it a stupid, oversized return
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.980]   that's going to get you financial freedom in just a few years.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.260]   I did it from the time I was 20 ish to 27.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.060]   I mean, I was in it like I was changing toilets and painting walls and all that.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.300]   And when I was 27, I was able to quit my job and quote unquote,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.360]   retire, starting with no money, starting with Cold Stone Creamery.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.200]   Now, you show me a stock strategy that somebody can start with no money.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.740]   And in seven years, be retired with that level of assuredness.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.580]   I'll be shocked.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.540]   I mean, if it can happen right by Bitcoin, do the GameStop thing.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.580]   Like you get lucky.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.620]   But I'm talking about like that level of confidence. It's rare.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.660]   So if you want to be active or great, if you want to be passive,
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.860]   there's ways for you to do that as well.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.120]   When I hear the word active
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.820]   and I think about how you talked about REITs buying a class,
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.620]   it made me think that, yeah, is the real unlock in real estate,
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.500]   the ability to buy a property and fix it up
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.740]   more than it is to just buy it and wade in cash flow?
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.880]   It is the true skill finding places that have the opportunity
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.140]   to put in less money than it will ultimately appreciate.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.800]   Is that where the magic is?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.080]   Is that what you look for with your company?
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.620]   I mean, there's a million ways that you can pull profits up.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.620]   But yes, if I'm getting your question right, what I like to do
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.720]   is I like to buy properties that you can immediately bump up the value
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.160]   and then it goes up gradually from there. Right.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.020]   So imagine you buy, let's go simple math, right?
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.200]   You buy a hundred thousand dollar property
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.060]   that you can just make look a little bit nicer.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.660]   And now it's worth one fifty.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.940]   You got to put a little money into it or whatever.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.360]   Let's say now it's worth from one hundred.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.500]   Now it's worth one fifty.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.840]   Well, now it appreciates from one fifty upward.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.940]   It's not starting at the hundred.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.280]   So you immediately start at this new high level and then it goes from there.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.420]   So that's one of my favorite strategies.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.120]   We call that value add investing to where you immediately add value.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.920]   That is not what REITs do.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.520]   And that's why REITs get a lower return is because REITs
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.660]   typically would just buy a property that's already there.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.960]   And they're just banking on three percent per year rent raises
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.420]   to make all their wealth.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.800]   And it's a strategy, I hear lots of people kind of amateur real estate
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.040]   investors are we're going to buy a place in a neighborhood
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   that maybe we understand because we've lived here and we're going to fix it up
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.980]   and either ourselves or hire someone and then we're going to flip it.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.320]   Is house flipping something that seems like such a great idea,
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.980]   but has a lot more cautionary tales than the average person knows?
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.020]   Definitely does. It's super fun, right?
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.080]   I mean, who doesn't like to take something ugly and make it beautiful?
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.000]   But maybe a lot of people, but I love it. It's super fun.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.100]   You feel like you're on HGTV and flipping things.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.660]   But flipping is very much a business in every way.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.040]   Like you go start a business doing a lot of things.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.100]   Some people just happen to do it with a piece of real estate, right?
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.680]   You fix it up, you make it better.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.800]   You sell for more money.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.440]   The risk of flipping, especially today in this market,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.340]   is that when you're flipping in a market that is dropping,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.340]   which is what we find ourselves in today.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.400]   Now, I don't think we're going to see a dramatic plunge 80% of real estate values.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.540]   But when you're in a market that is correcting,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.380]   you're kind of catching the falling knife, right?
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.520]   Like you're buying it for 100.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.980]   You're going to put 20,000 into it and you think it'll be worth 150.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.920]   But what if it's not worth 150?
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.680]   Like what if it takes you longer to do the project?
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.380]   Now it's only worth 140.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.260]   But you also went over budget and so you had to put an extra 20 into it.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.660]   Well, now you're broke even.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.960]   And then you pay the real estate agent and now you're losing money.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.000]   I've been there. I've had one bad flip that I lost money on.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.960]   Ironically, had I kept that property,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.500]   I would have made cash flow every month, probably between five
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.980]   and seven hundred dollars a month on that property.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.140]   I would have kept for the past nine years or 10 years since I bought it.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.780]   Today, I sold that property, ended up selling it.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   Those numbers actually were this property.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.780]   I tried to sell it for 150, didn't sell, ended up selling it for 120.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.660]   Today, that property is worth over half a million dollars.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:51.220]   So like real estate, one of the other things that's very, very helpful
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.800]   is it is a very forgiving asset class in time.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   It's a very forgiving asset class.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.600]   You can screw up a lot of stuff, but as long as you can hold it,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.540]   you get bailed out of almost everything.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.800]   That's not dissimilar from the stock market, right?
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.380]   If you just hold through the down times and through rough times,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.180]   you can survive almost anything.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.740]   And so the deal with real estate is you just need to buy properties
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.820]   that you can hold if you need to.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.020]   If you're going to flip houses, great.
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.580]   Just make sure if something goes wrong, you can hold it to bail yourself out.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.060]   You said rough times depend on who you ask.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.560]   We're either in rough times, we're on our way towards rough times
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.200]   or rough times are about to be in the past.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.000]   But it is true that interest rates are pretty high right now.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.640]   How does the current market affect what the average person
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.340]   should be thinking about doing when it comes to real estate investing?
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.180]   Interest rates are high if you look at a five year time span, right?
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.280]   If you look at a 50 year time span, they're actually pretty normal.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.820]   Whether or not they'll go up higher or lower, we don't know.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.620]   Interest rates definitely affect the market.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.720]   That's what the government's doing, right?
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.360]   Like they raise interest rates
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.820]   as a way to slow down the economy or the inflation anyway.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.960]   And so the government is actively trying to make house prices stop going up.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.660]   So by raising interest rates, they do that.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.240]   Ironically, we're in a really weird time right now
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.740]   where they are deliberately trying to raise interest rates
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.040]   to keep house prices from going up.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.740]   But what happens then is it makes it harder to build new property
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.680]   and it makes harder for people to buy property.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.580]   So where do all those people go?
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.140]   They go rent because they can't build a new property
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.320]   and they can't go and buy something.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.420]   So they go and rent.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.860]   Well, we've already got a housing deficit in America, a really bad one,
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.660]   which is why rents are going up so much.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.060]   So now we've got this increased problem.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.920]   The government is trying to slow down
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.320]   real estate prices and other prices from going up by raising interest rates.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.560]   But what the effect it's having is it's driving rents higher and higher and higher.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.160]   So who wins in that situation?
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.680]   Like who wins when rents are going up dramatically
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.180]   and people can't buy as much?
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.280]   Flippers don't win, right?
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.380]   Because you can't sell a house when you're flipping houses as much.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.520]   But when you own rental property and you have a fixed mortgage
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.120]   that does not change and your rents go up by 10 percent, 20 percent per year,
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.960]   it's the landlords, it's the rental property owners
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.320]   that are beginning wealthier and wealthier and wealthier.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.400]   Are we in rough times?
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.760]   I mean, if you're a tenant, yes, it's going to get rough.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.000]   I think the next few years,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.160]   I think tenants are going to see their rent go up across the country dramatically.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.560]   If you're a landlord.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.560]   I mean, it's going to be really good times for us in the next few years.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.180]   And honestly, that's what's propping up real estate values right now, too,
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.800]   because we know that's what's happening.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.200]   So we're willing to pay more for problems.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.340]   I'm willing to buy property right now that breaks even
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.040]   because I know that next year rent is going to be a lot higher,
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.820]   not everywhere, but in a lot of places.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.740]   So that's what I see in my crystal ball.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.020]   I could be 100 percent wrong, though.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.620]   If leverage is the magic that helps you get the returns,
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.020]   the cost of capital going up, does that eat into the returns
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.400]   or does it get made up for by rising rent prices?
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.820]   Or how do you even think about interest rates?
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.100]   Do you slow down a little bit right now or does it not affect you at all?
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.240]   It is compensated by rent raises. Right.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.980]   So on one hand, they're compensating, so it's not a big deal.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:54.700]   But what's cool is that like interest rates can be refinanced
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.920]   and you can refinance your mortgage at any point.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.220]   So it's not like, oh, I'm paying 7% right now on my mortgage. OK, fine.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.720]   Well, in two years, if they go back down, you refinance into a 5% or 4%.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.480]   You're not stuck for life with that.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.260]   But what doesn't historically always go down is rents.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.560]   Rents typically go up because inflation tends to go up.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.220]   Rates go up and down.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.560]   So it's kind of like dollar cost averaging.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.960]   And maybe it's use a phrase that I don't fully even understand
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.760]   because I'm not a stock guy.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.640]   But like right when things go down, you just refinance, get the lower rate
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.740]   and then you lock in that rate for the next few years.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.000]   If they go down again, you just refinance again.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.540]   I don't worry about rates right now because rates are temporary.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.040]   Rents are going up.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.120]   And I've been seeing all the news
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.280]   about the highest 30 year fixed prices in a long time.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.960]   And all I can think about is if I were going to mortgage right now,
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.280]   I would probably not be getting a 30 year fixed right now. Right.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.420]   My bet and I am not an expert and I could probably be wrong,
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.020]   but is that in the next 10 years, rates will likely at some point
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.560]   be lower than they are now.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.460]   So if I were buying a home today and this is not advice for anyone,
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.900]   but if I were, I would probably look at the like seven, 10 year
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.740]   adjustable mortgages where it's only fixed for seven or 10 years
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.660]   with the anticipation of being able to refinance in that window.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.980]   Yeah, which I think is just this amazing feature of a mortgage.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.780]   Like the bank can't refinance on you, but you can on them.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.020]   You can on them.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.680]   Yeah. The 30 year mortgage thing, it's for me.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.720]   Yes. If I can get a dramatically lower rate off a seven year arm,
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.920]   they call adjustable rate mortgage a seven or 10 year.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.520]   Yeah, I like that idea.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520]   Here's what I don't like, though.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.560]   What happened in 07, 08, right, is people have these adjustable mortgages
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.360]   for the same reason that we're having today.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.940]   And so they get the arm because it was cheaper.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.940]   And then the arm would shoot up when the market collapsed.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.000]   The arm shot up to 28 percent.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.080]   So all of a sudden, people's mortgages went from 1000 to 5000 dollars
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.920]   and they lost their homes.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.220]   That has been changed.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.360]   There are now limits on what an arm can do.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.360]   A lot of people don't realize this.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.320]   They think, oh, I would never get an adjustable rate mortgage
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.000]   because I don't want 08 to happen again.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.060]   Well, if you look at the paperwork and talk to your lenders,
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.500]   yeah, most arms have a max what they can get to.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.560]   And it's somewhere in the like the 11, 12 percent range.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.600]   Could rates stay high forever?
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.340]   And then your adjustable rate seven years from now goes up to 12 percent.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.600]   That is possible. That is a risk.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.100]   So if you really don't like risk, take a 30 year mortgage.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.300]   You can refinance a 30 year mortgage, too.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.760]   But if you want to lower your interest rate and take a little gamble,
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.600]   that's what I typically do.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.160]   Yeah, the arm's not bad.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.600]   I built that into my model when I was like, which one do we do?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.660]   And by the way, because of the lower rate, don't think of the break
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.600]   even as seven years.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.100]   You do a seven rate arm because you're going to get a lower rate.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.060]   You probably have maybe eight, nine, 10 years to refinance
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.800]   before it would have been a worse deal than the 30 year fix.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.500]   Because for the first seven years, you're saving money.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.660]   Yep. And you can invest that in other things and all that.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.120]   Yeah, 100 percent. I love that.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.820]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.820]   and so much more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.480]   in your situation, which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.780]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.720]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.640]   and everything from technology, finance, medicine to real estate, law,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   manufacturing and more.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.040]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.620]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.180]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.820]   alternative investments.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.140]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth,
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.580]   young, highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.180]   and learn from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.480]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.120]   investment opportunities.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.720]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.440]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.380]   to you on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:39.780]   to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.720]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.580]   So if you have more than two point two million in investable assets,

[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:10.140]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.320]   I've heard you say in real estate it can be easier to do bigger deals, right?
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.280]   Like some of these huge deals compared to buying one house
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.380]   and fixing it up can be easier and more profitable.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.580]   So what does that mean for the average investor?
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.340]   Does that mean forget starting with buying?
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.620]   I think for you, it was like, you know, you bought a house in Portland.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.540]   Forget that as your first strategy.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.540]   Is there a way to kind of skip and jump into something bigger
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.920]   without necessarily needing to hire someone?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.520]   Or is the answer to jump into these bigger projects?
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.880]   You need to invest with a syndicate or something like that.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.380]   Yeah, so you could definitely invest with a syndicate, right?
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.080]   That's totally fine.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.120]   You get a good return that way.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.640]   Hopefully you have a good person, right?
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.840]   A good company that you're working with.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.140]   Should a person jump into a larger deal?
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.340]   For example, there's an investor named Grant Cardone.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.640]   He's very popular on social media.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.820]   Millions of followers.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.220]   Very loud and exciting guy, right?
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.880]   So Grant has this big thing.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   He's always like, don't buy anything under 50 units.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.320]   It's stupid. You shouldn't do it.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   He's kind of a Dave Ramsey of the opposite side.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.420]   He'll tell you you're stupid if you don't use debt.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.480]   So over here, we've got Grant saying, don't do anything small ever.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.220]   Only buy large deals because they're easier.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.520]   And I've said the same thing.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.080]   Large deals are easier.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:37.320]   But large deals require a whole lot more capital that may not be yours.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.820]   And there's a big learning curve, right?
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.220]   So if I make a mistake on my that, let's go back to the flip.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.540]   I said I lost money on the one flip. I lost money on. Right.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.580]   So I lost probably $15,000.
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.940]   What I lost because the market wasn't as good as I thought it was.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.080]   Maybe I didn't do as good of a job rehabbing as I thought.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.680]   I took a lot longer than I thought.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.240]   I screwed up because I was new to flipping houses and I lost $15,000.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.140]   OK, you know, I can survive that.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.640]   I can earn that back other ways.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:08.080]   I bought a $100 million apartment complex and I screwed up and lost 15 percent.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.020]   Well, now I've just lost $15 million
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.040]   of probably investor capital or your own capital.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.880]   So going big is great.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.440]   It is easier because you have smarter people at all the levels
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.080]   and the salaries for those people or whatever you want to call it.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.380]   The way those people get paid is kind of baked into it
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.040]   because you're buying a business.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.620]   If you're buying an apartment complex, you are not buying a real estate.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.640]   You're buying a business that happens to trade in real estate.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.480]   That makes sense.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.120]   You have people, you have staff, you have processes, systems.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.480]   And the bigger you go, the better those systems and processes
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.240]   and people are, which is why you want to go bigger when you're buying a duplex.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.620]   I mean, who's changing your toilet?
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.980]   You got to call the plumber or you got to go do it.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.380]   When you own one percent of a billion dollar portfolio,
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.440]   that portfolio manager has people who take care of the problem for you.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.740]   So, yeah, bigger can be easier because you're allowed more people.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.080]   You got bigger teams.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.840]   And frankly, there's just more cash flow
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.380]   usually to be able to afford and to pay for all those problems.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.520]   This might be a naive question, but is it easy
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.880]   even at the small level to hire someone to handle all the problems with a rental?
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.320]   If I were to say I want to buy a rental property in North Carolina, right?
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.780]   I'm not going to drive over and fix it.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.580]   It's a multi-hour flight.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.280]   Maybe I have to change planes.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.820]   But is it easy as a small time real estate investor
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.580]   to buy a property in another state and hire someone to manage it?
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.920]   Are they easy to find those people and vet those people?
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.580]   And does it eat too much into your returns that it makes it not worth it?
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.280]   It is so easy to hire someone to manage your rental properties.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.620]   It's so hard to hire someone good to manage your rental properties.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.420]   Right. And so, I mean, there's a million of them out there.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.720]   There's a million property managers.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.660]   There's an entire industry of people who you can hire for 10 percent
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.420]   typically of whatever the rent is, they'll take care of your property.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.560]   So you've got a property, the rent is a thousand dollars.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.760]   They'll charge you 100 bucks a month to manage your property for you.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.360]   No problem.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.120]   But their only incentive is to make sure the property doesn't go empty.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.520]   And they've got a thousand other units that they're also incentivized
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.760]   to make sure they don't go empty.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.380]   So it's not impossible.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.180]   There are great property managers out there.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.980]   I've worked with a lot of good ones, but I've worked with a lot of bad ones
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.480]   that they'll put in anybody and they don't care about you.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.620]   They don't care about your property as much.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.760]   So the key is due diligence. Right.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.360]   It's the exact same logic.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.460]   Have you ever hired an employee before you owned a company?
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.120]   So, I mean, it's really easy to hire an employee, right?
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.180]   It's really easy.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.260]   Just put a job description.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.080]   Guy walks through the door.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.460]   They have a pulse. Hire them.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.760]   It's really hard to hire a good employee.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.420]   And the way you hire a good employee
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.660]   is by testing out a few of them, knowing what you want,
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.380]   getting recommendations, looking at referrals, interviewing them,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.220]   talking to them, and then if they suck, letting them go right away
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.220]   and firing fast and hiring slow, right, that whole thing.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.620]   It's no different when you hire a property manager
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.580]   to look after your properties.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.680]   You're just hiring a team member to take over your property.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.920]   So it's because they say their property manager doesn't mean they're good.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.680]   That's the bottom line.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.360]   A funny analog to that is we have an au pair
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:08.080]   and we were asked this question after we interviewed our last au pair.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.860]   We probably did four or five video calls.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.780]   We had her meet the kids. We talked about everything.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.920]   We wrote up a guide to how we would want everything in our house to function
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.880]   and how we take care of our kids and the responsibilities.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.520]   And then we got this email that was like,
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.880]   we have a few questions for you now that you've matched with your au pair.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.620]   One, have you and your partner both talked to the au pair?
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.320]   And we're like, yeah, of course.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.120]   And then it was like, have you guys talked about childcare expectations?
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.580]   I was like, this person is going to live in our house to take care of our child.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.680]   Of course, we've talked about childcare expectations.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   And then this whole thing clicked when we started hearing from our au pair
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.860]   how so many of the other au pairs she was friends with
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.260]   had these terrible situations where the expectations were totally wrong.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   And she was like, oh, well, some of them had a one 20 minute call.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.220]   And that was it.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.820]   And I just couldn't believe that people who I would imagine
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:55.960]   in their professional lives treated hiring with a really rigorous process.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.480]   And then in their nonprofessional work lives, their job life,
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.820]   just hire people with a totally different thing.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.920]   So it sounds like that same principle applies.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   Whether you're hiring someone to manage your property
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.820]   or you're hiring someone to watch your kids interview them
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.920]   like you would if you were running a business and trying to hire an employee
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.580]   you want to work for you for many years.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.880]   Dude, that's so good.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.460]   This goes to one of my favorite questions.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.420]   I think my performance coach once asked me, but I use it all the time in people.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.120]   And I'm going to ask it to you right now.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.820]   It's exactly related to this.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.620]   What is something that you do in your strong area of life
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.920]   that you don't do in your weak area of life?
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.160]   Right. Like maybe your strong area of life is business.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.520]   So one thing you do really well is you hire people really well.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.080]   You put them through the whole system
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.420]   and then you don't understand why your au pair is terrible.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.620]   Not you, but people. Right.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.080]   Because they're not doing the things in one area of their life
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.840]   that they do in the other one.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.780]   So if you want to improve the weak area of your life,
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.540]   just do the same stuff you do in the strong area of your life.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.020]   This is that idea of like whether it's an au pair, whether it's whatever,
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.980]   like do the stuff that you know you need to do and don't be lazy about it,
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.240]   because that's why you're good at that one thing in your life.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.680]   So what's something you do in a strong area of your life
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.280]   that you're currently not doing in a weaker area of your life?
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.680]   It's funny because the creation of this podcast in some way
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.620]   was me trying to identify all the areas of my life for improvement
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.580]   and applying the principles of them.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.980]   So I think when I got started, there were a lot more. Right.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.060]   I was like, gosh, when it comes to health and eating, I was like,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.920]   I know this is important and I'm not optimizing it at all.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.580]   So we end up just like eating quickly, making unhealthy food.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.380]   And then we were like, hmm, well, if I was at a company
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.260]   and I was trying to run this like a business,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.860]   I would try to figure out if maybe there was someone else could do it.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.780]   And so then we ended up outsourcing to someone local
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.660]   that cooks meals and drops them off like we do to a chef in our house.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.380]   We outsource put an ad on Craigslist and look for someone.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.980]   Hey, do you like to cook? Can you cook?
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.920]   I don't know if I have a perfect example now, because every time
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.680]   I find one of those things, I'm like, I attack it like this crazy thing.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.320]   And then I usually end up talking about it on the show
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.480]   or making a whole episode about it or interviewing someone
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.980]   to try to figure out how to do it.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.480]   So I guess maybe if I went through the list, I was like,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.160]   what's on my list of things I want to talk to people about?
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.820]   I definitely don't feel like I've nailed best practices for sleep.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.720]   You know, I track my sleep and I do a pretty good job,
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.640]   but I don't feel like I've gone deep there.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.820]   So an episode on sleep is one that's kind of imminently
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.080]   sitting on the back burner.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.340]   There's probably a few other topics.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.320]   So I would say whatever topics come up on the show in the next six to 12 months
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.540]   are things that I probably, in hindsight, I'm doing terribly right now.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.680]   Well, I love that you brought that example up, right?
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.440]   It's the example of like fitness.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.920]   People are like, oh, I'm sort of my fitness.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.340]   And I'm like, OK, well, what do you do in business when you struggle?
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.840]   Like, oh, you know, I read business books.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.480]   I go to conferences, I go to meetups, I interview people.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.640]   OK, why aren't you applying that to your fitness?
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.980]   Maybe read a fitness book, right?
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.320]   Maybe go to a conference on fitness.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:40.780]   I don't know.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.980]   Use the stuff that works that you know works
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.940]   and apply it to the areas where you're struggling with.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.040]   So I love that you brought that example.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.080]   Food and fitness is a huge one. Good stuff.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   OK, we've talked about improving lives.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.640]   You've mentioned mindset, performance coach.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.440]   I have a lot of things I want to touch on outside of real estate.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.580]   But I do have one question I want to get your take on.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.180]   I assume you're pro owning your own primary residence.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.680]   I'm pro ish owning your own primary residence.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.880]   I love it.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.340]   There are reasons not to.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.780]   But mathematically, yes, I love it.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.440]   Yeah. I mean, look, if you're not going to be in it for a while,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.780]   if you want the flexibility of being able to move all kinds of reasons,
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.440]   I'm not one to say everyone should own.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.680]   In fact, I think there are a lot of people who think they should own
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.840]   that should probably be renting.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.820]   But let's say you're not opposed to it.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.240]   You're not like, don't buy a home. Correct.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:25.020]   So we've talked about a lot of different types of real estate.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.920]   The one I'm curious to get your take on.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.080]   I hear from a lot of people saying, gosh, you know,
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.020]   maybe I live in the Bay Area, maybe I live in New York, real estate's too expensive.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.340]   So I'm going to buy a vacation home.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.920]   And I see so many people say, I can't afford this.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.980]   So I'm going to buy a house in Tahoe.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.420]   We have a lot of friends who said, I'm going to buy a house in Tahoe.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.420]   And to me, I've always been like, gosh,
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.520]   I don't want to manage a house in Tahoe as a rental.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.940]   I'm not going to be there all the time.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.380]   We ended up buying a fractional home with this company, Picasso,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.220]   and we now own one eighth and we only go six weeks a year.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.920]   It's been absolutely fantastic.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.140]   It's exactly what we need.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.380]   But I'm curious what you think about vacation rentals, time shares,
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.240]   that whole side of real estate that we haven't really touched on at all.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   This is a great question.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.040]   So generally speaking, I think that vacation homes are a tremendous
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.540]   waste of money when it's like I'm going to buy a house that I can go visit
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.240]   as a vacation, because you're starting from the wrong angle.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.140]   You're not starting with, I want to buy an investment.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.520]   You're starting from an emotional standpoint of, I really like Cabo.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.680]   I'm going to go buy a vacation house in Cabo.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.140]   And then you're just screwed from the first minute you do it.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.480]   And then, yeah, you got all the headaches of owning property.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.820]   Oh, forgot to renew the insurance.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.980]   So they sent the bill to the wrong place or something broke where you were gone.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.840]   And now the water leaked all over the floor.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.320]   So when you approach it from I want a vacation house because I like Cabo,
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.480]   I'm generally 100% against that. Just go rent a place in Cabo.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.080]   There's great houses and they'll clean up after you're done.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.220]   It's way better just to rent a place.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.020]   Now, if you have a place you like going to all the time,
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.920]   a thing like what you did, a fractional ownership.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.520]   I love that idea because you still have part ownership,
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.520]   but you're not wasting the other 90% of your year
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.900]   that you're just not going to use it.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.820]   So I like that strategy a lot when the numbers work out.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.960]   But again, I would just caution people to look at, like,
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   are you really better off owning something or is it better just to go on Airbnb
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.020]   or rent a stupid house that's different each time so you get to have more fun?
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.220]   That's up to you.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.500]   And then timeshare stuff. I avoid all of that.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.560]   I don't like really much of any of the timeshare stuff.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.560]   I'm sure some of it's good.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   I'm just not good at it.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.320]   And I don't like the shadiness of the industry that has been for the last 50 years.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.740]   Now, the last thing, though, is owning vacation rentals,
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:29.240]   like owning an investment that you buy as an Airbnb property
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:34.800]   or as a VRBO property, that can be a tremendous cash cow.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   Like I said earlier, seven grand a month for my condo.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.340]   I got another one coming online next month between the two of them.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.640]   That's 14 to 15 thousand dollars a month in profit I'll be making.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.100]   That's like retire from your job, sit on the beach for the rest of your life
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.240]   kind of money from two properties.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.040]   But it is a business.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.440]   It is fully a business that requires systems.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.640]   People, processes, the whole works.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.700]   And it's also very heavily dependent upon service hospitality.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.140]   So if your tenant says jump, you got to say how high they'll give you a bad review.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.640]   And then that reflects like poorly on you and you get less bookings and all that.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.940]   So if you're willing to put into work to own an investment property
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:15.700]   that does vacation rentals, it is a phenomenal strategy.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.560]   Even better if you can manage it yourself.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.060]   Like one vacation rental can give somebody complete financial independence
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.960]   if you're willing to manage it yourself.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.680]   One vacation rental, two vacation rentals will change your life.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.960]   And you don't mean a vacation rental that you're like, I like to go to Cabo,
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.380]   so I'm going to buy it in Cabo and rent it out when I'm not there.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.860]   You mean I'm going to treat this like a business.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.660]   I'm going to buy a vacation rental wherever I think the best vacation
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.720]   rental market is.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.620]   Now, maybe that's Cabo. I don't know.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.560]   Broadly speaking, whether it's real estate to invest in or vacation rentals,
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.880]   where do you even go to start to learn?
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.260]   Where is the most desirable place to buy right now?
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.620]   Where do you collect that data?
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.720]   Or is there an obvious answer that I, as a novice here, don't know?
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.560]   There's not. It's very nuanced, which is why real estate is so powerful
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.520]   because it's not an efficient market.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.020]   Right. When we talk about the efficient markets like stocks or whatever,
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.880]   very efficient, you can buy and sell real easily.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.560]   Insider trading is not allowed, right?
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.280]   Insider trading is allowed all day long in real estate. It's great.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.680]   I use insider trading all the time in real estate investing.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.480]   Now, someone's going to take that clip right there,
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.060]   cut out the last half of that and throw me in jail for it.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.180]   But no, insider trading is totally out.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.260]   So in other words, where do you have inside knowledge?
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.420]   What area do you know?
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.820]   I would argue that your knowledge of an area is more important
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.580]   than the metrics of an area.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:28.760]   Your knowledge of an area is more important than the metrics of an area.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.180]   I know Maui, Hawaii really well.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.280]   I've lived here for four years.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.560]   I moved here because I prioritize lifestyle over profit.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.060]   But once I got here, I learned Maui really, really well.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.080]   So I can do really, really well here.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.320]   You could not.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.780]   Like you would lose money almost for sure in Maui because you don't know the market.
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.520]   The market metrics are almost irrelevant.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.520]   There are ways to learn more, right?
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.880]   There's a million blogs out there in bigger pockets.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.220]   The podcast is on forever.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.680]   They do a lot of vacation rental stuff, but just in general market research.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.140]   I'm a big believer in find what other people are doing.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.920]   That's like what you want to do and just do it where they're doing it.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.080]   But you don't have to reinvent the wheel if you're like, oh,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.320]   there's a lot of people doing vacation rentals in the Smoky Mountains right now.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.420]   I can name at least 10 friends of mine that have Smoky Mountain vacation rentals.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.640]   So do you think you could be number 11?
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.880]   Probably.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.520]   Are you willing to learn the market to get good enough to make money in it?
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.320]   If yes, then do it.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.480]   So, yeah, there is no one definitive source.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.980]   It's like this is where the best thing is,
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.340]   because then everyone would go there and then it wouldn't be the best thing anymore.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:33.440]   So what are you willing to research, look into and then jump in?
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.380]   OK, you mentioned bigger pockets, any other resources, books,
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.280]   things that people should go to if they want to go deeper than just this episode?
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.640]   Bigger Pockets is amazing, right?
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.900]   So Bigger Pockets, I didn't start it.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.480]   I was just on their podcast for a decade.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.280]   But I was a young real estate investor who found Bigger Pockets
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.980]   when I bought my first property.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.580]   And they have a massive forum.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.440]   Like, again, they're not paying me to plug this.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.680]   I'm just saying like this changed my life because there was a place
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.040]   you could go and just be like, I'm looking into these Smoky Mountains.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:03.740]   Does anyone know a good vacation rental spot in the Smokies?
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.880]   You'll get 50 people who invest in the Smokies to be like,
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.180]   yeah, don't do it or do it here. Watch out for this place.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.300]   The forum is phenomenal for Q&A.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:14.280]   Almost every question that could ever be asked is probably already asked in there.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.800]   So you don't even have to ask it if you're an introvert.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.340]   Like you just want to go and read.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.640]   But yeah, Bigger Pockets amazing.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.900]   The forum blog podcast meetups are great.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.440]   I love local meetups. Real estate's an interesting community,
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.540]   just like the tech community in a lot of cities like Denver, Austin, San Francisco.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:32.140]   You get really good meetups of like founders and entrepreneurs
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:35.240]   that get together because it's a lonely business to run a business by yourself.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.480]   Real estate the same way.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.020]   Every major city in America has meetups happening almost every night of the week.
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.140]   Somewhere you can find a lot of them on Bigger Pockets.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.080]   I think it's BiggerPockets.com/events.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.820]   You can find them on Meetup.com.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.220]   You can start your own.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.820]   But real estate investors getting together, you're going to learn so much more
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.680]   than if you were just pick up my book from Amazon or somebody else's book,
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:59.480]   because it's real people in the area doing the thing that you want to do.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.220]   I love it.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:06.320]   Part of my foray into the tech sector in the Bay Area was just I arrived here.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.020]   I didn't know a single person and I was like, I just need to meet people.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.820]   So I went to there's this like SF New Tech meetup.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.080]   I would go to that and there were just millions of them.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.180]   And then I ended up hosting my own event, which was another big part of it.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.980]   And so I'm a big fan of meeting people in the flesh,
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.920]   which we are now getting at least much more comfortable doing.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.080]   So this has been great. Yes.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:29.920]   OK, if that ending seemed abrupt, it was probably because it wasn't
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.580]   actually the end of our conversation.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:32.840]   We kept going.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.080]   If you remember when I introed Brandon at the beginning,
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.840]   there was so much more than real estate I wanted to talk about.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.720]   But I didn't want to release a two hour podcast on two separate topics.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:46.020]   So instead, in a few weeks, I'll put out another episode of all the hacks
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.520]   where I dig into the mindset Brandon used to build a massive
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.740]   real estate empire while also living his ideal life.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:56.280]   We'll talk about setting goals, hacking self-discipline,
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.180]   using performance coaches, finding the balance between audacious
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.320]   business goals and quality family time.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.980]   And finally, all of his amazing Maui recommendations,
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.080]   which by the time that airs, I'll probably have gone and used myself.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.280]   So definitely check that out in a few weeks, because I already know
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.480]   it was fantastic.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.880]   And next week, we have an incredible conversation with Annie Duke,
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.340]   author of Thinking in Bets and Quit.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.520]   But until then, have a wonderful week.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.440]   Please send me questions for the next Mailbag episode
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:30.420]   where I'll cover life, work, non points, travel and anything else you send my way.
