[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   NFTs basically just like a form of digital ownership.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.080]   Let's specifically take the form of NFT that everybody likes to criticize.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080]   That's just digital art.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.380]   Right.
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.360]   And so every criticism people make of that is the same criticism you would
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.880]   make a buying and selling paintings.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.480]   It would be the same buying and selling photographs.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.720]   What's the Mona Lisa worth?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.520]   So one way of looking at the Mona Lisa is that it's worth
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.120]   the cost of producing it, right?
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.880]   It's, it's worth the canvas and the paint.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.000]   Or you could say the Mona Lisa is like a cultural artifact.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.960]   And as a cultural artifact, it's worth, you know, probably a
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.440]   billion dollars or $10 billion.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.480]   Like what explains the spread between $25 and like the $10 billion?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.600]   Because people care, right?
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.580]   Because it's art, because it's aesthetic, because it's cultural.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.600]   It's part of what we've decided is, is the cultural heritage of humanity.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.860]   The thing that makes like life worth living is that it's not
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.120]   just about like subsistence.
