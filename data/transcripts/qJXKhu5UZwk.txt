[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.320]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.020]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.100]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.940]   to the general public.
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.160]   Before we begin today, just want to acknowledge
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.840]   that if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.840]   yes, I have a bandage on the left side of my face.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200]   I was trying to cook something for Costello and I,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.260]   and I got burned, burned myself.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.300]   It was a cooking accident.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.880]   I'm fine, no need to dwell on it, we can move on.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.000]   But I just wanted to let you know,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   everybody's going to be okay.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.480]   He got a great meal, I got a burn and a great meal.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.700]   Today's episode is brought to us by Four Sigmatic.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.600]   Four Sigmatic is a wellness company
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.680]   that makes mushroom coffee.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.800]   For those of you that haven't heard
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   of mushroom coffee before, just want to make clear,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840]   these are not psychedelic mushrooms,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   and no, the coffee does not taste like mushrooms at all.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.160]   It tastes amazing, and it tastes like coffee.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.720]   I started using Four Sigmatic coffee a few years ago,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240]   and then we actually stocked it in my lab.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.920]   We still stock it in my lab because it tastes really good.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.540]   And it also happens to have two types of mushrooms in it
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.760]   that I particularly like because of their supplement
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.360]   and medicinal qualities.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.940]   And those two are lion's mane mushroom,
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.340]   which has been shown in several research studies
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.960]   to have a mild anxiolytic, meaning anti-anxiety effect,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.500]   and mood elevating effect.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.540]   Those are from research studies done independently.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.620]   As well, it has chaga mushroom.
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.120]   Chaga mushroom has been shown to increase growth factors
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.080]   that impact the nervous system, like nerve growth factor.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.520]   So that's the reason I drink it,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.140]   and that's the reason we stock it in the lab,
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.220]   and that's the reason why I drink it at home.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.920]   If you'd like to try Four Sigmatic,

[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.680]   for up to 40% off and free shipping.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.240]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.140]   Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.160]   condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.960]   that you can read or listen to.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.360]   For me, I really like listening to books on Blinkist,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.320]   even books that I've already read.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.520]   Typically, the way I consume information
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.320]   is unless it's fiction, I'll listen to a nonfiction book,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.720]   or I'll read the actual physical hard copy
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.100]   of a nonfiction book, and then at the end,
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.720]   I like to take some notes about things
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.640]   that really stuck with me or key takeaways
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.120]   that I'd like to teach or share with other people.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   With Blinkist, it allows me to go back to those books
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.680]   and get all the essential items,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.960]   some of which I might've missed
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.040]   in the course of listening to
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.840]   or reading the full-length version.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.440]   And if I haven't read a book before,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.360]   it also gives me a sense
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.680]   of whether or not I'd like to read the book.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.840]   Blinkist has some terrific science category books.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.640]   For example, my colleague and friend David Eagleman's book,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.440]   "Livewired," which came out recently,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.120]   is all about neuroplasticity.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.300]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.680]   I read the full-length book,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.360]   and I've listened to it on Blinkist,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.240]   and it's a terrific synopsis of "Livewired."
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's in there, David Sinclair's book, "Lifespan."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.740]   Many of you probably know that David Sinclair,
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.140]   a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School,
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.880]   is a real pioneer in the aging and longevity field.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.420]   His book, "Lifespan," is terrific.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.300]   I've read the full-length book, I've listened to it,
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.000]   and I've listened to it on Blinkist,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.280]   and so it really captures a lot of the essential elements
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.620]   that you would want to get from that book.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.040]   Blinkist is also just a great way
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.000]   to get through many books on the bookshelf
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.920]   that you've been meaning to get to,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.560]   but you haven't had time.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.920]   With Blinkist, you can get unlimited access to read
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.140]   or to listen to a massive library of books,
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.880]   not just science books,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   and they're all condensed in this way of just 15 minutes
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.100]   will allow you to get all the key information.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.800]   So right now, for a limited time,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.120]   Blinkist has a special offer
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.960]   just for Huberman Lab Podcast audiences.

[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.160]   Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.520]   that releases deep muscle tension.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.360]   I was introduced to Theragun on a dive expedition
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   for my laboratory a few years ago.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.920]   On that expedition, we were working very hard.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.080]   We were diving all day.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   We were carrying Pelican cases with equipment.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.040]   We were carrying tanks.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.140]   Very sore, very tired by the end of the day,
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.840]   as was everybody else.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.380]   Someone brought along a Theragun,
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.320]   and pretty soon that thing was getting passed around.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.640]   It became the most coveted device on board
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.480]   because it really works to relieve the soreness
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   and deep muscle tension that accumulates
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.880]   with physical work, exercise,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.100]   even just sitting too long throughout the day.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.060]   So when I got back, I got a Theragun.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.960]   I still use the Theragun daily.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.880]   It's terrific because it's very quiet,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.960]   so you can use it while watching a movie
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.360]   or even while having a conversation
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.480]   without it feeling intrusive.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.080]   It really gets down into the meat of the muscle if you want,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.060]   or you can use it more superficially if you like.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.600]   If you want to try Theragun,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.000]   you can go to theragun.com/huberman.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.660]   They have several models available.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.680]   The first one starts at $190,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.340]   which if you think about it is comparable
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.640]   to the price of a professional massage,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   except that unlike a professional massage,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.120]   you can use the Theragun for as long as you want
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.980]   throughout the day and for as many days as you like.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.440]   That's theragun.com/huberman,
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   and I should mention that there's also
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.760]   a 30-day money back guarantee.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.820]   So if you don't like the product, you send it back,
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.160]   you get your money back.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.040]   This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   we're talking all about hormones,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.280]   these incredible chemicals that can impact our mood,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.160]   our behavior, our feelings of optimism or pessimism.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.700]   The amazing thing about hormones
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.480]   is that hormones impact all those things,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.000]   but all those things, how we feel and what we do
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.800]   and what we think also can impact our hormones.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.280]   And so it's a really fascinating area of biology
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.080]   that impacts every single one of us every day,
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.040]   both in wakefulness and in sleep and throughout the lifespan.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.880]   Today, we're going to be talking about hormone optimization,
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.600]   and we're mainly going to be focusing on estrogen
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.000]   and testosterone and their derivatives.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.480]   Last episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.580]   we talked about sexual development.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.800]   That is how the chromosomes, the gonads and hormones
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.000]   impact what we call sexual development,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.880]   leading all the way up to puberty.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.400]   Today, we're mainly going to talk about processes
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.420]   that happen from puberty onward.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.600]   Although we might talk a little bit
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.000]   about development as well.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.900]   So today, we're going to talk a lot about basic biology,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.560]   but we're going to weave in a lot of practical tools
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.440]   along the way for how to optimize
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.720]   these incredibly powerful things that we call hormones.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.240]   Before we dive into our discussion
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.060]   about hormone optimization,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.520]   I want to raise what I think is a very important point
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.600]   that at least I hadn't heard of until recently,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.580]   which is the concept of salutogenesis.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.760]   Many of us are familiar with the concept of pathogenesis,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.940]   the idea that there are all these scary diseases
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.040]   like dementia and heart disease and stroke
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.820]   and all these things that await us
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.480]   if we don't take good care of ourselves
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.320]   and that might await us even if we do.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.200]   That's the pathogenic model.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.100]   Salutogenesis is something I learned about
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.240]   from one of my Stanford Medicine colleagues,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.760]   which is a different orientation toward health and wellbeing
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.520]   where you're taking on particular behaviors,
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.360]   you're taking on a particular stance towards nutrition
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.780]   and exercise, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.300]   in order to promote wellbeing above where you would be
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.640]   if you were not doing those behaviors.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.460]   If you think about these two things,
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.820]   salutogenesis and the pathogenic model
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.200]   are really two sides of the same coin,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.700]   but I'll just give an example
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.580]   of how this might affect you in a real way.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.200]   If you like exercise because it feels good, great,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.760]   but many people exercise or eat well for that matter
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.220]   in order to avoid heart disease or to avoid dementia,
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.420]   to avoid negative changes in body composition.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.220]   And while that's powerful and certainly is the case,
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.100]   that exercise will help you move away from all those things,
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.920]   the salutogenesis model differs in that
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.760]   it involves a mindset and an orientation
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.320]   towards doing those things in order to feel good,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.240]   in order to enhance your level of energy,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.360]   in order to improve endocrine function
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.900]   and metabolic function.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.800]   So it's really part of the pathogenic model
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.420]   and yet salutogenesis is really more of a mindset
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.740]   toward why you would do these particular behaviors.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.180]   And really the most powerful mindset is going to be one
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.820]   where you are thinking about the pathogenic model,
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.660]   doing things so that you don't end up sick, et cetera,
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.340]   and to move away from sickness,
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.420]   as well as the salutogenic model
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.260]   where you're doing things
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.740]   in order to move towards health and wellbeing.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.700]   We think of health and wellness nowadays
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.700]   or the wellness community or wellness practices,
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.300]   and in many ways that is the essence
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.900]   of the salutogenic model,
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.600]   but I found it very interesting to know
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.820]   that within the field of allopathic medicine,
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.880]   these two models exist,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.860]   but we don't hear about the salutogenic model
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.020]   quite as often.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.300]   So it's just something to keep in mind,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.440]   especially because of some of the mindset effects
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.760]   that were discussed in previous episodes.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.500]   I'm not going to go into these in detail again right now,
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.240]   but if you might recall from the episode on food and mood,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.140]   we talked about some of these incredible studies
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.180]   that were done by Alia Crum's group at Stanford and others,
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.600]   showing that if you tell people
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.800]   that the behavior that they're about to do,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.180]   in this case, it was people cleaning up hotel rooms
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.340]   'cause that was their job.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.400]   If you tell them that it's good for them,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.420]   then you see much greater positive health effects
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.620]   than if they aren't aware of that information,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.660]   that it's good for them.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.640]   So we should really be thinking about
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.100]   not just moving away from disease and negative things,
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.700]   but also why certain things are good for us,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.540]   because it's well-established now
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.660]   from really good scientific studies
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.440]   that keeping in mind the positive effects of things
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.900]   can really have an outsized effect on wellbeing
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.980]   right down to the level of our physiology.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.660]   So let's talk about hormone optimization.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.540]   Today, we're going to talk about hormone optimization
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.340]   in reference to estrogen and testosterone
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.920]   and their derivatives.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.680]   Now, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.140]   are what we call sex steroids.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.580]   Now, the sex steroids immediately call to mind sex,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.060]   for obvious reasons, and steroids,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.740]   meaning anabolic steroids.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.780]   But I just want to emphasize that estrogen and testosterone
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.500]   are present in everybody.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.460]   It's their ratios that determine their effects.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.700]   So today, we're going to talk about
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.340]   how you can optimize their ratios
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.860]   depending on your particular life goals,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.720]   because the ratio of estrogen and testosterone
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.100]   in every individual has profound influence
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.260]   on feelings of wellbeing, feelings of optimism,
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.260]   feelings of anxiety or lack of anxiety,
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.980]   on reproduction, on sexual behavior,
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.020]   independent of reproduction.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.220]   They are profoundly powerful molecules,
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.860]   and we all make these molecules to some degree or another,
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.860]   but there are also important behavioral tools,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.420]   supplementation tools, as well as prescription drugs
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.580]   that can impact the ratios of testosterone and estrogen
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.180]   in really powerful ways.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.340]   So we're going to cover all of that.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.120]   I want to emphasize that when you hear sex steroids
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.580]   or steroid hormones,
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.220]   most people think about anabolic steroids.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.540]   And of course, anabolic steroids
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.860]   are derivatives of testosterone or testosterone itself,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.220]   and they are heavily used and abused in the sports community
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.280]   as well as outside the sports community.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.260]   But there of course are many steroids
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.700]   that are not anabolic steroids
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.220]   that are also abused in sports.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.500]   Today, we're not talking about drugs and sports,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.860]   but I think that it carries such a heavy weight
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.340]   when people hear the word steroids,
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.020]   they think about anabolic steroids.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.420]   So while today's discussion will certainly be relevant
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.300]   to physical performance,
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   in fact, we're going to talk about
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.540]   how specific types of exercise,
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.780]   particular patterns of cold exposure,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.260]   as well as particular patterns,
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.900]   believe it or not, of breathing,
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.920]   can impact sex steroid hormones,
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.100]   both estrogen and testosterone.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.620]   The discussion isn't really geared
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.560]   towards performance enhancement in sport,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.580]   although we will do an entire episode,
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.860]   perhaps even an entire month
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.420]   related to performance enhancement in physical enterprises.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.340]   So one of the first things to understand
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.520]   if you want to optimize your hormones
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.300]   is where they come from.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.060]   There are a lot of different glands in the body
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.060]   that produce hormones.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.940]   There's the pineal gland.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.620]   Some hormones are made in the hypothalamus.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.340]   Hormones are made by the gonads,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.600]   the ovaries or the testes.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.380]   You've got the thyroid gland.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.580]   There are a bunch of different glands
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.100]   that make these different hormones,
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   but when we're talking about the sex steroid hormones,
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.460]   estrogen and testosterone,
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.700]   the major sources are ovaries for estrogen
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.300]   and the testes for testosterone,
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.080]   although the adrenals can also make testosterone.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.380]   Now, there are also some enzymes.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.740]   Enzymes are things that can change chemical composition,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.780]   and the enzymes that we're going to talk about today
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.900]   are the aromatases mainly.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.440]   The aromatases convert testosterone into estrogen.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.300]   So in a male, for instance, that has very high testosterone,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.100]   some of that is going to be converted
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.660]   into estrogen by aromatase,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.760]   and aromatase is made by body fat.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.100]   It's also made in the testes themselves.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.200]   A lot of people don't realize this,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.240]   but the testes actually have the capacity
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.500]   to manufacture estrogen and aromatase, albeit at low levels,
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.180]   but this turns out to be important
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.900]   for optimizing hormone levels in males at later points,
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.300]   and we'll discuss that.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.260]   It's important to note that there's a huge range
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.100]   in terms of the levels of hormones,
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.500]   testosterone and estrogen, between individuals,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.100]   and it actually occurs
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   within individuals across the lifespan.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.780]   I'm not going to throw out specific numbers
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.580]   of X picograms per deciliter, et cetera, today,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.540]   because that's going to vary a lot.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.500]   It's going to depend on whether or not
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.480]   you're measuring in picograms or nanograms
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.320]   and that sort of thing.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.860]   If you want to examine your hormones,
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.020]   you should do that in conjunction with a medical doctor,
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.260]   ideally an endocrinologist,
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.160]   can help you sort out that information,
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.040]   but the important thing to know
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.660]   is that prepubescent females make very little estrogen,
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.660]   and when we talk about estrogen,
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.320]   we mainly talk about estradiol,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.520]   which is the most active form of estrogen
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.320]   in both males and females.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.860]   So prepubescent females, very low levels of estrogen.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.740]   During puberty, levels of estrogen,
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.740]   AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket,
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.220]   and then across the lifespan,
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.380]   estrogen is going to vary
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.320]   depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.180]   but as one heads into menopause,
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.060]   which typically takes place nowadays,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.800]   somewhere between age 45 and 60,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.300]   levels of estrogen are going to drop,
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.100]   and then post-menopause levels of estrogen are very low.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.840]   As well, testosterone will fluctuate across the lifespan.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.580]   Testosterone is going to be relatively low pre-puberty,
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.860]   in males during puberty, it's going to skyrocket,
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.160]   and then the current numbers are that it drops off
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.380]   at about a rate of 1% per year,
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.980]   although we're going to talk about some data
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.900]   that show that there's actually
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.420]   tremendous variation in testosterone levels.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.020]   There's actually a lot of examples of men in their 90s,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.540]   their 90s, who still have testosterone levels
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.300]   that mimic pubertal levels, which is remarkable,
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.780]   and speaks to the huge variation in testosterone levels
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.540]   across individuals.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.900]   So let's talk about other sources of these hormones,
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.260]   and then it will make clear what avenues
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.540]   you might want to take in order to optimize these hormones.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.680]   The other glands and tissues in the body
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.620]   that make these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.860]   as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals,
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.140]   so the adrenals right up top the kidneys,
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.180]   and the release of these steroid hormones from the adrenals,
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.480]   in particular testosterone
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.280]   and some of its related derivatives,
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.860]   are mainly activated by competition.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.900]   So let's talk about competition,
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.480]   because it turns out that competition
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.960]   is a powerful influence on the sex steroid hormones,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.280]   and the sex steroid hormones
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.160]   powerfully influence competition.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.760]   So most people don't realize this,
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.560]   but most males of a given mammalian species
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.840]   never get to reproduce.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.900]   In fact, they never even get to have sex at all.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.560]   And we don't often think about that,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.900]   but testosterone plays a powerful role
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.340]   in determining which members of a given species
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.640]   will get to reproduce,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.800]   which ones of that species
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.320]   will actually get access to females.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.600]   And so here I'm not talking about humans specifically,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.160]   but it's well-known in species like elephant seals,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.980]   in species like antlered animals and rams, for instance,
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.800]   that the higher levels of testosterone
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.280]   correlate with access to females.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.440]   Now, one interpretation of this
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.720]   is that the females are detecting
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.320]   which males have high testosterone and selecting them.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.540]   They're more receptive to them.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.520]   We're going to talk about receptivity
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.840]   for mating in a moment.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   But it's actually more so
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.400]   that the males that have higher testosterone
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.160]   forage further and will fight harder for the females.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.400]   And this is really interesting
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.360]   because there's very good evidence now
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.920]   that testosterone can reduce anxiety,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.840]   promote novelty seeking,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.240]   and promote competitive interactions.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.640]   And so before you leap too far with this in your mind
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.480]   and think about all these human behaviors,
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.320]   just stay with me
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.560]   'cause there's a little bit of biology here
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.880]   that makes it all make sense.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.100]   And it turns out to be pretty simple.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.120]   We have a brain region called the amygdala.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.540]   In Latin, that just means almond.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.080]   But the amygdala is most famous for its role in fear.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.640]   We hear a lot about fear and the amygdala.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.700]   But the amygdala is really involved in threat detection.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.420]   It sets our thresholds for anxiety
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.920]   and what we consider scary or too much.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.560]   Testosterone, secreted from the gonads
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.860]   and elsewhere in the body,
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.840]   binds to the amygdala
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.660]   and changes the threshold for stress.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.120]   So I've said before on previous versions of this podcast
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.500]   and on other podcasts,
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.200]   that testosterone has this incredible effect
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.900]   of making effort feel good.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.300]   But what I was really referring to
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.520]   is the fact that testosterone lowers stress and anxiety,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.280]   in particular, in males of a given species.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.340]   Now, this is important
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.840]   because we often think of testosterone
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.900]   as creating whatever, masculinization
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.460]   or it's virilization
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.200]   or all these terms are thrown around.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.260]   But what's it really doing
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.380]   when it comes to mate choice and competition?
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.760]   What it's doing is it's reducing the threshold for anxiety.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.880]   And in doing so,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.860]   it selects individuals of a given species to push further,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.040]   being willing to suffer more,
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.340]   although it also reduces pain,
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.820]   so maybe they also suffer less,
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.780]   in pursuit of reproduction in females.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.660]   Now, it's well-known in humans
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.620]   that both males and females
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.940]   who have elevated levels of testosterone
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.080]   will engage in more novelty seeking.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.420]   And I do want to point out
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.460]   that even individuals without testes have testosterone
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.420]   and peaks in testosterone have similar effects,
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.180]   regardless of whether or not someone has ovaries or testes.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:10.820]   Testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging,
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.780]   more novelty seeking, increases in libido
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.240]   and increases in desire to mate.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.900]   So it is the case that increases in testosterone
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.420]   promote competitive and foraging type behaviors
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.160]   in humans and in non-human mammals.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.240]   But it's also true that competition itself
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.280]   can increase androgens such as testosterone.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.180]   I want to repeat that.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.440]   Competitive environments themselves
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.660]   can increase testosterone.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.560]   Now, some people have come to the conclusion
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.900]   that if you win, your testosterone goes up,
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.880]   and if you lose, your testosterone goes down.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.440]   And to some extent, that's true,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.540]   but that's not a direct effect on the gonads.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.320]   That's actually mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.020]   We talked about dopamine in the episode
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.660]   on motivation and drive.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.260]   And dopamine and testosterone
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.140]   have a remarkable interplay in the body.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.260]   Dopamine is actually released in the brain
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.440]   in ways that has the pituitary,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.720]   this gland that sits over the roof of your mouth,
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   release certain hormones that then go on
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.220]   to promote the release of more testosterone.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.980]   And indeed, winning promotes more dopamine
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.700]   and later more testosterone.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.600]   However, in the short term,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.180]   just competing increases testosterone
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.020]   independent of whether or not you win or lose.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.340]   So the short version of this
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.180]   is that competition increases testosterone.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.120]   And this may be an ancient mechanism
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.380]   whereby the androgens, such as testosterone,
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.860]   are feeding back to encourage
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.380]   more competitive-type behaviors.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.780]   Because every species,
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.380]   whether or not you're talking about reproduction
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.620]   or other resource allocation, is involved in competition.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.540]   Not every individual of a species
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.620]   gets access to the same number of mates
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.500]   or the same quality of mates.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.980]   And this is true in both directions,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.180]   for males and females and everything in between.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.260]   So I just want to emphasize once more,
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.080]   in case I went through it too quickly,
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.340]   that increases in testosterone in females
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.560]   are also going to lead to increase in reproductive behavior
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.660]   or seeking out reproductive behavior.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.680]   They increase libido.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.860]   In fact, there's a particular phase of the menstrual cycle
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.600]   where testosterone peaks just before ovulation
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   that, on average, leads female humans to seek out sex
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.880]   more than they would otherwise during their cycle.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.460]   And this is all by self-report,
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.440]   but this is also while measuring things like testosterone,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.160]   estrogen ratios, and so forth.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.440]   So it's really interesting that a single molecule,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.160]   regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background,
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   is increasing seeking of mates across individuals,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.860]   increasing desire to compete or willingness to compete,
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.220]   and lowering the threshold for stress and anxiety.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.440]   It's important to point out
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.600]   that while increases in testosterone
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.620]   promote seeking of mates and reproduction
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.740]   in both males and females,
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.100]   in females, it's actually increases in estrogen
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.820]   that promote receptivity to mating.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.540]   So testosterone is driving the seeking of sex,
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.540]   and estrogen is promoting the actual act of sex from females,
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.860]   so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.860]   In males, it's interesting to point out
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.100]   that testosterone is promoting seeking of sex,
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.780]   but it's also estrogen in males that's important for libido.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.460]   If estrogen levels are brought too low,
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.580]   then men will completely lose their libido.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.960]   This is often not discussed or overlooked
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.620]   in the discussion about testosterone therapy
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.300]   and performance-enhancing drugs.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.980]   People think that hyperandrogenized individuals,
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.480]   meaning people that have very high levels of androgen,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.520]   will have very high levels of libido,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.900]   and they will provided estrogen is available
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.840]   in sufficient ratios to match that testosterone.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.180]   So it's not simply the case
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.200]   that high levels of testosterone
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.180]   produce a lot of sex and mating behavior,
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.460]   and low levels of estrogen are good across the board.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.300]   You actually need both in both males and females.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.840]   It's just that in females,
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.560]   the testosterone levels are always going to be lower
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.580]   than the estrogen levels,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.360]   and in males, the estrogen levels
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.740]   are always going to be lower than testosterone levels.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.340]   So testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior,
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.000]   and the real question then is,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.760]   does sex itself promote testosterone?
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.540]   And the answer is somewhat complicated,
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.720]   but the short version is yes.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.220]   And as you recall, sex has multiple stages.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.180]   So there's the physical act of sex,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.560]   there's the seeking of sex,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.740]   and then there's orgasm and ejaculation.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.760]   Now, it's important to distinguish between these
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.580]   because whether or not sex itself increases testosterone
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.820]   depends on whether or not the male ejaculates.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.820]   And this is very important to understand
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.540]   because on a previous episode,
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.760]   I mentioned how dopamine increases with sexual activity.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.520]   Remember, dopamine and testosterone
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.860]   tend to increase linearly with one another,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.700]   but then after ejaculation, there's a release of prolactin,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.740]   and prolactin actually sets the refractory period in males
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.260]   during which he can't have sex again.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.160]   And the duration of the refractory period
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.380]   will vary tremendously depending on how much
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.260]   and how long that prolactin release occurs.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.360]   I also described in a previous episode
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.980]   how some people take vitamin B6,
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.100]   I'm not suggesting anyone do this,
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.540]   but take vitamin B6 in order to reduce prolactin levels
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.640]   and thereby reduce the duration of the refractory period.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.360]   But getting at this question about testosterone
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.820]   and sexual behavior, it's important to distinguish
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.740]   between these different phases of reproduction
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.640]   or reproductive behaviors.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   So there are studies showing that sexual behavior itself
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.040]   can increase testosterone.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.360]   There was a study published in 2011 from Escasa et al.,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.420]   E-S-C-A-S-A, this is the stuff of textbooks,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.880]   this is on PubMed, these are quality studies,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.980]   showing that men who observe sex,
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.920]   so I guess this would be observing pornography,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.700]   will have slight increases in testosterone
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.080]   during the observation.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.880]   These people actually were willing to have blood draws taken
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.740]   while watching pornography.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.480]   They had increases in testosterone
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.640]   that were very modest of about 10%.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.560]   Whereas when people participated in sex,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.680]   they actually did this study where people had blood draws
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.320]   and they had real sex with their partners,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.240]   and they had 70% increases in testosterone.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.400]   So there are increases in testosterone
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.040]   that are quite significant during the physical act of sex
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.480]   and far less so during observing sex.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.260]   Now, the question that I often get,
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.160]   in fact, it's one of the questions I get most often
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.680]   in the comments on YouTube, I don't know why that is,
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   is whether or not ejaculation adjusts testosterone levels.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.120]   And it turns out there are two studies that I could find
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.000]   that were quality studies on PubMed that addressed this,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.200]   that sex and ejaculation itself
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.800]   does not reduce testosterone levels,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.340]   although it will increase prolactin levels
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.400]   for the reasons I described a moment ago.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   However, abstinence or sex without ejaculation
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.000]   for a week or more will increase testosterone levels
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.440]   up to 400%.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.920]   So the answer is actually complicated.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.440]   It's not straightforward.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.600]   What it means is that sex itself increases testosterone.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.560]   However, abstinence also increases testosterone even further.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.660]   So it's a nuanced answer.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.560]   And I hope this is satisfactory, no pun intended,
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   to those of you that have been asking me
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.020]   what is the relationship between sex and ejaculation
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.760]   and testosterone and dopamine?
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.200]   It is nuanced.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.360]   And you have to understand that nuance
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.960]   if you want to understand how certain behaviors
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.160]   impact hormones and how hormones impact those behaviors.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.080]   As I mentioned before, in females,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.020]   testosterone also primes the motivation to seek out sex.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:55.880]   And sex itself also increases testosterone,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.040]   but it also increases prolactin.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   So in both men and women, sex increases prolactin post sex.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.320]   It's just the way that the system works.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.560]   It's that testosterone and dopamine increase
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.160]   in the seeking out and the behavior of sex.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.920]   And then after sex, prolactin levels go up.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.080]   There's kind of a quiescence.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.220]   The whole nervous system is promoted towards calm.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.440]   And this may actually have something to do with pair bonding
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.780]   and the encouragement of individuals
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.260]   to spend more time together to exchange different smells
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.880]   and hormones and maybe even pheromones.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   And we're going to talk about pheromones in a moment.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.900]   A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.840]   about the hormone DHEA,
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.960]   which is mainly made by the adrenals.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.240]   DHEA has been promoted as kind of a catchall
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.600]   for increasing testosterone and estrogen
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   in males and females.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.140]   And indeed DHEA will increase both testosterone and estrogen.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.720]   This is something to be mindful of
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.400]   if you're thinking about taking DHEA
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.600]   or you're taking DHEA already.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.800]   DHEA will increase both testosterone and estrogen.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   And the extent to which it increases one or the other
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.720]   will depend on whether or not you're starting off
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.680]   with more estrogen than testosterone,
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.520]   or whether or not you're starting off
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.080]   with more testosterone than estrogen,
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.360]   and whether or not you have a lot of aromatase.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.400]   So for individuals that have a lot of aromatase
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.760]   being made by the testes or by body fat,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.560]   if you take DHEA, there's a good chance
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.560]   that a fair portion of that is going to be shuttled
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.000]   towards estrogen production
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.400]   and not towards testosterone production.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.140]   Whereas in individuals that have low levels of testosterone
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.920]   to begin with, high levels of estrogen,
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.240]   there's a good chance that the DHEA
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.360]   is going to promote mainly estrogen production.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.880]   At least that's what I could find
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.080]   from the research studies that I examined.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.560]   So the way to think about DHEA,
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.520]   it's a kind of global promoter of the sex steroid hormones,
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.640]   and its specific effects are going to depend
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.040]   a little bit on where you started
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.200]   and whether or not you have ovaries or testes.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.460]   So just as there are behaviors
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.580]   that can increase testosterone,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.840]   there are behaviors that can decrease testosterone.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.600]   And one of the most well-characterized ones in humans
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.320]   is becoming a parent.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   So expecting fathers have an almost 50% decrease
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.020]   in testosterone levels, both free and bound testosterone.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.180]   As well, their cortisol levels, a stress hormone,
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.640]   drop by almost threefold, which is incredible.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.340]   And their estradiol levels double,
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.200]   so their estrogen levels double.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.160]   So expecting fathers, many people have known,
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.880]   put on additional body weight.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.940]   Everyone always thought that it's because they're eating
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.360]   in parallel with their pregnant wife,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.740]   but it turns out that these effects of reduced testosterone,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.080]   increased estradiol, and reduced cortisol
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.880]   can all be explained by an increase in prolactin.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.000]   So not just in humans, but in other species as well.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.760]   When the male and female of that species
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.380]   are expecting young, they lay down more body fat.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.120]   The assumption is that this is to prepare
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.200]   for long nights of no sleep,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.460]   which occurs in many species, not just in humans.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.840]   So it's really interesting that this hormone prolactin
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.640]   can start suppressing whole categories of hormones,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.780]   sex steroid hormones,
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.040]   and can start increasing whole categories of other ones.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.580]   So we hear about the dad bod.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.180]   There are a lot of explanations for the dad bod
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.580]   that extend well beyond this podcast episode,
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.180]   but it is a well-known phenomenon
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.820]   that testosterone is going to drop,
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.380]   prolactin is going to increase,
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.900]   estradiol is going to increase in males and females
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.940]   that are expecting children.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.460]   Now, how long that lasts is very interesting.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.820]   It actually has to do with how much contact
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.100]   and how much contact with the smells of the baby,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.380]   of the offspring the father happens to have.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.860]   So how available or unavailable he is
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.900]   will actually impact his level of hormones.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.680]   Now, I am definitely not promoting the idea
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.020]   that fathers or mothers take time away from their offspring
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.900]   in order to keep their testosterone levels high
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.180]   or to restore them.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.660]   That's not what I'm saying at all.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.020]   It's just interesting to point out
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.700]   that these evolutionary mechanisms push us toward
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.360]   or bias us toward particular categories of behaviors
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.940]   by influencing our hormones,
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.780]   which then feed back and promote more
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.160]   of that particular behavior.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.900]   Because as I mentioned before,
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.680]   peaks in testosterone in males and females
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.300]   cause individuals to seek sex, not promote parenting.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.140]   Whereas reductions in testosterone, increases in prolactin,
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.280]   and decreases in cortisol move individuals of both sexes
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.780]   toward parenting behavior
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   and less toward reproductive behavior.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.440]   The other behavior that markedly reduces testosterone
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.100]   in both males and females,
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.260]   and markedly reduces the desire for seeking sex
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.240]   and sex itself is illness.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.500]   And many of you might say, well, duh,
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.600]   when people don't feel sick,
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.140]   they don't feel like seeking out mates
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.620]   and they don't feel like having sex.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.140]   But have you ever wondered why that actually is?
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.260]   Well, it turns out that it can be explained by the release
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.760]   of what are called inflammatory cytokines.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.300]   So cytokines are related to the immune system.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.260]   They travel in the lymph and in the blood,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.940]   and they attack invader cells like bacteria and viruses.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.940]   And under conditions of illness,
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.700]   we make a lot of different cytokines.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.660]   Some of them are anti-inflammatory,
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.780]   but some of them are pro-inflammatory.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.900]   And the best known example of a pro-inflammatory cytokine
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.940]   is IL-6.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.220]   And it's known that IL-6, when injected into individuals,
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.700]   will decrease the desire for sex,
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.380]   and eventually will reduce levels of testosterone
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.620]   and estrogen, independent of feeling lousy.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.740]   So the reason why people don't want sex when they're sick
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.040]   is because levels of IL-6 are increased.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.620]   Now, this is important because as we start to think about
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.500]   the different ways to modulate the sex steroid hormones,
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.240]   so-called optimize the hormones,
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.020]   keeping levels of IL-6 low is going to be important
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.100]   for them to exert their effects.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.460]   Now, IL-6 doesn't just travel to the gonads
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460]   and shut down the gonads.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.000]   It actually has ways to interact
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.360]   with some of the receptors that the steroid hormones,
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.460]   estrogen and testosterone bind to,
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.860]   and impact those receptors
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.600]   so that the sex steroid hormones can't have their effect.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.660]   In short, and put simply,
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.900]   inflammatory cytokines like IL-6
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.740]   are bad for sex steroid hormones.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.200]   And so we're going to talk about how to modulate IL-6
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.980]   in the direction that you would want,
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:13.300]   and how to increase another cytokine called IL-10,
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.060]   which is anti-inflammatory,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.620]   in ways that can help promote
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.180]   or at least support the sex steroid hormones.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.360]   So as we move forward,
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.180]   we're going to now start to consider
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.420]   what sorts of behavioral practices,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.040]   as well as other things,
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.140]   can modulate the sex steroid hormones
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.340]   in the directions that you want them to go.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.740]   But before we do that,
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.440]   and in order to set the stage for that,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.180]   you should be asking yourself,
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.080]   how is it or why is it at a mechanistic level
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.040]   that behaviors can modulate hormones at all?
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.980]   If you think about it,
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.240]   it's kind of strange that just the mere act
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.480]   of being a parent or parenting
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.000]   can change testosterone levels so dramatically
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.560]   or estradiol levels so dramatically.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.400]   What is it?
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.840]   Is it the sweat of the baby?
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.360]   Is it their saliva?
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.720]   Is it the sight of the baby?
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.000]   Is it holding the baby?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.700]   Or is it all those things?
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.060]   It turns out that many of those effects
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.780]   are because of smell,
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.020]   or in some cases, even possibly pheromones.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.240]   Now I talked about hormones.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.720]   Hormones, again, are a chemical,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.560]   travels in the body,
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.040]   impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.180]   A pheromone is a chemical that's released
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.720]   by one member of a species
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.080]   that goes and impacts members elsewhere,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.920]   but of the same species or even of other species.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.780]   Now pheromone effects are absolutely well-established
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.340]   in lots of animal species,
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.760]   but they are very controversial in humans.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.140]   Today, I'm going to talk about
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.400]   some of the well-established ones in animals.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   I've mentioned one or two of these before
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.760]   on previous podcasts,
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.420]   but I haven't mentioned several of them.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.420]   And I'm going to talk about the evidence
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.740]   for pheromones in humans that are well-established.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.720]   So the main ones in animals that are discussed
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.060]   are called the Lie-Bute effect,
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.500]   the Witten effect, the Bruce effect,
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.460]   and the Vandenberg effect,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.660]   named after the people that discovered them.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.120]   The Lie-Bute effect is when you house females
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.360]   of a given species together with no males,
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.900]   they start displaying longer,
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.320]   what are called estrous cycles.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.700]   In many species, they don't have menstrual cycles,
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:13.820]   which are 28 days.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.140]   They have estrous cycles,
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.100]   which tend to be four days or some variant thereof.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.460]   It's an interesting phenomenon
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.480]   because what it means is that the presence of the male itself
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.120]   is changing the ovulation cycle.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.000]   Now, many people out there,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.200]   imagine mostly the people that are ovulating out there,
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.480]   will say, "Of course, I notice I ovulate differently
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.400]   or my cycle changes when I'm in the presence of my partner
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.380]   or I'm not."
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.560]   But the pheromone effect
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.800]   that mirrors this Lie-Bute effect in humans
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.400]   has still not really been identified.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.320]   Nobody knows what the exact chemical is,
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.240]   but nonetheless, this is a strong effect in some animals.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.320]   The other one is the Bruce effect,
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.800]   and this is a very dramatic effect
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   whereby a pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her fetus
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.320]   if the dad of those animals,
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.800]   the father that sired the litter,
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.360]   'cause these are animals, they're litters,
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   is removed and a novel male is placed in her vicinity
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.800]   for about 48 hours.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.480]   And what's interesting is the way that this happens
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.800]   is a pheromone that comes from male urine
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.820]   activates the gonadotropin-releasing hormone system
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.480]   and causes a reintroduction of the estrous cycle
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.920]   and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.220]   Now, a lot of people have taken the Bruce effect
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.840]   kind of to its extreme and asked
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.240]   whether or not in humans, miscarriages are caused
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.400]   by detecting the pheromones or odors of novel males,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.600]   meaning the non-dad male, and that's still an open question.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.320]   Nobody knows if that's true or not,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.480]   so I want to emphasize that.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.100]   The other one is the Vandenberg effect,
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.120]   and this is one I alluded to
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.740]   in a previous episode of the podcast,
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:55.420]   which is that puberty in females can be accelerated
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.260]   by placing a novel sexually competent male
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.420]   in with a young female who has not undergone puberty.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.640]   There's also a version of this, which I haven't described,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.480]   which is delay of puberty,
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.240]   where you take juvenile female animals
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.080]   that have not undergone puberty,
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.800]   and you put them with more mature females
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.780]   of the same species,
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.640]   and that introduction of more females will cause a delay,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.240]   a significant delay in the onset of puberty.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.880]   So these are all pheromone effects,
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.320]   and we know they're pheromone effects
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.460]   because they're not conscious.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.060]   They also don't require actual contact
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.680]   with the other members of a given species.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.420]   These are all effects that can be mediated
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.200]   by the urine from a given species
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.080]   or by the sweat of a given species.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.320]   And speaking of sweat, the one pheromone effect
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.580]   that I'm very aware of from the published literature
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.920]   is a paper that was published in 1998
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.720]   by Stern and McClintock,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.880]   which was getting at this question
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.640]   of synchronization of menstrual cycles.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.340]   Now, the whole idea of synchronization of menstrual cycles
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.320]   is pretty controversial.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.480]   For a long time, people said,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.000]   "Oh, this is absolutely a well-characterized phenomenon."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.440]   People living in dormitories,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.980]   their menstrual cycles would synchronize.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.840]   People living in environments together,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.420]   their menstrual cycles would synchronize.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.040]   And then some studies came out
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.520]   that kind of undercut those data
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.320]   and said, "No, this actually doesn't happen,"
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.800]   and it was kind of controversial.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.400]   But there is a very clear effect
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.720]   that was described by Stern and McClintock.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.440]   What they did actually was they took females,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.520]   they charted their cycles,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   and then they had other females wear pads in their armpits,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.800]   and they collected sweat from those females.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.600]   And then they took the sweat from those pads
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.200]   in those females' armpits,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.520]   and they introduced them to women
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.600]   who had never had contact with the people who had sweated.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.200]   They only had contact with their sweat.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.080]   In fact, they swabbed it underneath their nose.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.600]   But if that sounds gross, they dilute it in alcohol,
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   so much so that they can't actually detect
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.120]   the odor of the sweat.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.760]   That's actually very important because it's not the smell,
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.560]   it's the pheromone chemical itself.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.620]   And it turns out the pheromone chemical itself
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.400]   can modulate the menstrual cycle,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.800]   although it doesn't necessarily synchronize it
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.240]   with the sweater.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.640]   What it does is it changes the duration
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.340]   and the pattern of ovulation
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.740]   relative to so-called follicular phase.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.580]   Long and short of this is that the sweat and pheromones
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:34.060]   of females can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.800]   of other adult females.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.140]   It's just a question of whether or not they synchronize.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.980]   And if you're kind of rolling your eyes now and saying,
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.260]   well, of course they do, and this is really detailed,
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.100]   this is how the science is done.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.680]   And the reason why people are so skeptical
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.620]   about the presence of pheromone effects in humans
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.780]   is that there's no well-identified pheromone organ.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.200]   We have an area of our nose that's responsible for smelling,
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.700]   that's well-established, it's been observed in MRIs
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.880]   many, many times in cadavers, many, many times
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.700]   in pretty much all individuals.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.960]   But the vomeronasal organ,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.700]   which is the pheromone detecting organ,
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.600]   hasn't really been found in humans.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.220]   There's something called Jacobson's organ,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.620]   which is thought to be the organ in the nose.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.020]   It's actually on the top of the roof of the mouth
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.620]   and in the kind of back of the nose.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   This is for a few wine tasters, I never can pronounce this.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.460]   What are they called?
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.580]   Sommelier, whatever, it's the people that are excellent
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.460]   at drinking and detecting the essences of wine
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.780]   that you have to go through all these tests
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.800]   in order to get certified as one of them.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.700]   Somebody tell me.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.140]   They are using probably a similar mechanism
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.820]   of mixing taste and smell.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.900]   And Jacobson's organ, if it exists,
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.940]   the vomeronasal equivalent in humans
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.280]   is thought to be a combination of smell and taste.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.720]   Now, it gets even weirder and cooler
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.400]   when you think about a given study that was done in humans
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   where if you take hundreds of t-shirts from boyfriends,
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.160]   keep them separate, you take those t-shirts,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.940]   you wash them many times separately,
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.660]   and then you offer them to the girlfriends,
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.980]   the longtime partners of those guys.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.820]   And what you'll find is that the girlfriend
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.580]   can pick out her boyfriend's t-shirt
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.220]   among hundreds of other t-shirts,
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.720]   not because it smells different,
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.340]   but because something about it seems different.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.460]   It might smell different to her
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.500]   in some way that's kind of imperceptible even to her.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.420]   And the level of accuracy in detecting that t-shirt,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.520]   her partner's t-shirt,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.120]   is way above statistical significant thresholds,
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.020]   so much so that you almost have to say
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.740]   there's something about these effects
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.740]   that are real pheromone effects.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:45.980]   Although people still argue
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.560]   that there are no pheromone effects in humans,
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.100]   that it's all through olfaction,
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.060]   I think these are interesting and important to understand
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.260]   because it means that a lot of things
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.500]   coming through our nose,
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.780]   whether or not it's pheromones or smells,
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.500]   are impacting hormones and our ability to attach memories
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.260]   and kind of recognition of mates and other people,
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.380]   including our children, not just our mates.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.420]   And of course, perfume manufacturers
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.700]   have really picked up on the idea of pheromones
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.900]   and have entire laboratories set up
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.620]   to build chemical compounds into perfumes
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.360]   that are designed to attract other mates.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.820]   This is a well-established and well-documented phenomenon.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.180]   And the last point I'll make about pheromones
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.220]   is that this combination of taste and smell
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.260]   is such a real thing in the animal world
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.040]   that there's something called the flemming response.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.460]   During the mating season for different animals,
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.060]   you can actually even see this in horses,
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.980]   but for animals that are seasonal maters,
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.740]   they'll do something called the flemming response
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.660]   where they actually open their lips and their mouth
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.820]   and they expose their gums
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.700]   so that they can capture pheromones
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.420]   that are floating in the wind and the environment.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.140]   They actually are looking for mates using their mouth
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.220]   and kind of sniffing around.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.620]   If you own a dog and you watch the way
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.120]   that the dog will sniff around,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.020]   selecting where they want to urinate, males and females,
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.980]   there's often, they're bringing molecules into their nose.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.660]   I know it sounds kind of gross sniffing urine,
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.120]   but there are a lot of pheromones in urine of animals.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.700]   A lot of pheromones are traveling in the wind.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.660]   Again, whether or not this is happening in humans,
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.940]   I don't know, but then you think about the perfume thing
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.700]   and here people are putting these scents on themselves
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:19.300]   that contain putative pheromones, human pheromones,
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.020]   and walking around hoping that their scents
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.140]   are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.900]   from other individuals of the same human species.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.060]   So we are among the animals in this behavior
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.100]   independent of whether or not
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.860]   you believe pheromone effects exist.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.460]   So let's get back to behaviors
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.680]   that can help optimize hormone levels.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.860]   One of the main behaviors that's been shown to be associated
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.660]   with poor levels of estrogen
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.980]   relative to age-match controls for people with ovaries
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.700]   or lower levels of testosterone
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.060]   compared to age-match controls for people with testes
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.040]   is apnea.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.980]   Apnea has everything to do with underbreathing
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.280]   and the buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.900]   There are other effects of apnea as well.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.540]   But if there's a consistent literature in this whole story
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.340]   about aging and reductions in hormones and general health
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.520]   and reductions in hormones, it's apnea.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.820]   I went deep into the literature on advanced menopause
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.420]   or when menopausal symptoms are exacerbated.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.860]   And I went into the literature on andropause
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.740]   or early onset andropause.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.260]   So levels of testosterone that are far lower
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.820]   than they should be for a given age.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:41.040]   And in every case, you could find multiple papers
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.780]   that showed that apnea or poor efficiency of breathing
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.880]   and buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.720]   was a problem.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.640]   Mostly sleep apnea, although apnea in general
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.780]   was shown to be an issue negatively impacting hormones.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.580]   Now, the directionality of this effect isn't entirely clear.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.380]   It could be that reductions in estrogen cause apnea.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.180]   And actually there's some reason to believe
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.020]   that might be the case.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.440]   I found at least one paper showing
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.180]   that there are estrogen receptors on some of the neurons
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.740]   that actually innervate the lungs
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.140]   and allow for the perception of how full
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.420]   or empty the lungs are.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:23.340]   In other words, reductions in estrogen may adjust breathing
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.840]   by changing our sensitivity to our own lungs.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.420]   Now, that was true for males and females.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.900]   Remember, estrogen in both males and females.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:36.540]   But as well, I found papers in which testosterone reductions
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.140]   were associated with apnea and testosterone receptors
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.860]   are also found on a lot of cells in the so-called viscera,
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.300]   including the lungs.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.180]   So again, the directionality of the effect isn't clear.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.140]   But what's really interesting is that
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.300]   there are very clear ways in which patterns of breathing,
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.580]   especially patterns of breathing in sleep
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.620]   can modulate hormones in ways that are immediately
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.920]   actionable and can serve to optimize
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.780]   both estrogen and testosterone,
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.580]   regardless of whether or not you have ovaries or testes.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.060]   So what is apnea?
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.780]   Apnea is under-breathing
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.300]   or mainly cessation of breathing during sleep.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.540]   So people are holding their breath
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.500]   and then they'll suddenly wake up.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.700]   Actually, I've talked about the physiological sigh
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.880]   on previous episodes of this podcast
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.180]   of this pattern of double inhales followed by exhales
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.420]   that one can do consciously to reduce stress
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.780]   and anxiety and offload carbon dioxide.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.340]   That pattern of breathing is actually
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.340]   what kicks in spontaneously
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.160]   anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.860]   Although in many people who have apnea,
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.600]   they don't engage the physiological sigh.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.820]   People who are dramatically overweight
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.500]   also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.640]   There's actually a lot of buildup of carbon dioxide
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   in the body, and that can lead to excessive sleepiness
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.500]   during the day, inability to access
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.220]   the deeper phases of sleep.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.060]   And it's well-established that going into deep sleep
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.140]   and getting the proper patterns of slow wave sleep
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.160]   and REM sleep are important for hormone optimization.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.720]   I talked about how to modulate sleep and optimize sleep
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.820]   in the first month of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.020]   So please check out those episodes
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.900]   if you have sleep issues or you want to work on your sleep.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.040]   Also check out Matt Walker's terrific book, "While We Sleep,"
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.140]   and that will help you find various protocols
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.220]   to help you optimize your sleep.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.300]   But the issue of breathing itself
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.340]   can be adjusted in the daytime waking hours
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.140]   in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep,
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.340]   reduce incidents of sleep apnea,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.620]   and apparently from some emerging literature
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.500]   can also help to optimize various hormones
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   even just by breathing in particular ways while awake.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.780]   So here's how this works.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.660]   There's now a lot of literature showing
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.940]   that breathing through the nose, not through the mouth,
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.980]   is powerful for improving lots of things.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.540]   First of all, it improves cosmetic features
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.500]   of the jaw and face.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.080]   This was first well-established by my colleagues at Stanford
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.460]   in a book called "Jaws," the story of a hidden epidemic.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.700]   This is by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich,
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.680]   who are both faculty at Stanford,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.620]   has a foreword by Robert Sapolsky,
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.180]   the great Robert Sapolsky,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.700]   and it also has a heavy endorsement up front
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.520]   by Jared Diamond, the author of "Guns, Germs, and Steel,"
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.500]   the Pulitzer winner.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.460]   So a lot of heavy hitters on this book, "Jaws."
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.220]   It's not a book that a lot of people know about unfortunately
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:26.020]   but it really describes the benefits of nasal breathing
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.900]   and the terrible things that happen
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.460]   when people, in particular children but adults also,
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.260]   are heavy mouth breathers.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.740]   So mouth breathers have changes in the cosmetics
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.000]   of their face and jaw that are really bad
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.560]   in terms of attractiveness,
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.900]   and this was done in twin studies.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.240]   You can look in the book and see some of this.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.180]   It's really dramatic how being a mouth breather
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:49.540]   tends to make the chin drop back behind the upper mandible.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.840]   There's a lengthening in the face, a drooping of the eyes.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.460]   It can be quite dramatic or modest
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.380]   depending on how much mouth breathing.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.200]   Now, sometimes we have to breathe with our mouths,
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.420]   but there's also a lot of data and studies
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.300]   described in this book, "Jaws,"
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:05.020]   that describe how nose breathing in wakefulness
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.780]   and in sleep promotes all sorts of positive things
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.500]   related to not just cosmetics
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.260]   but also the improvement of gas exchange of carbon dioxide
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.140]   and oxygen in the body.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.260]   And as well, it can modify levels
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.580]   of different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.660]   in ways that positively can impact hormones.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.780]   So believe it or not, being a nasal breather
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.520]   and avoiding being a mouth breather
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.420]   can actually positively impact hormones,
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.460]   and in particular, the hormones testosterone and estrogen,
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.700]   although the way that it does that
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.260]   is by making you a better sleeper,
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:43.940]   which allows you to produce more testosterone
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.300]   and the appropriate amounts of testosterone and estrogen.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:52.200]   But it does that in part through indirect mechanisms
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.180]   because deep sleep supports the gonads,
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.860]   the ovaries and the testicles,
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.600]   and the turnover of cells and the production of cells.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.340]   Remember, in the ovary, particular cells
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.780]   and the egg follicles themselves make estrogen,
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:08.780]   and in the testicle that the sertoli cells
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.800]   and the lytic cells are important
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.360]   for the formation of sperm and for testosterone respectively.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.620]   So what does this all mean?
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.060]   This means we have to be breathing properly.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.300]   It almost sounds kind of like kind of new agey,
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.560]   like, oh, you have to breathe properly,
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.480]   get your hormones right,
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.520]   but no, you have to breathe properly
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.100]   to get your breathing and sleep right
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.120]   so that your sleep can actually be deep enough
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.320]   and you're not entering apnea states,
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.240]   and then that will support gonad function.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.800]   And I wouldn't be putting this out
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.440]   as one of the main behavioral tools upfront
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.120]   if it weren't for the fact that the effects of apnea
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.800]   on these hormones are dramatic and terrible,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.160]   and the positive effects of getting breathing right
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.080]   on these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.880]   are dramatic and wonderful.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.860]   So let's talk about a few of those studies briefly
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.120]   so I can underscore the value of proper breathing
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.980]   in order to optimize hormones.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.180]   So I was able to find at least four quality studies
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:06.000]   showing that when apnea is reduced in sleep or eliminated,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.860]   there are significant increases in testosterone in males
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.900]   and in proper estrogen to testosterone ratios in females.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.000]   And the way that it works is very interesting.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.240]   Apparently, it works by reductions in cortisol.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.900]   Now, cortisol is a stress hormone
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:25.000]   that is released early in the day as we wake up
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.920]   and serves healthy roles in protecting us against infection,
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.880]   reducing inflammation, et cetera,
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.800]   but you don't want cortisol to be too high
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.080]   and you certainly don't want to elevate it too long
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.100]   throughout the day and night.
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.480]   And so we all know, because now we've been told a lot
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.540]   in the last decade or so, that getting proper sleep
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.240]   is important for all these aspects of health.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.480]   Getting proper sleep can really offset all the reductions
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.320]   in testosterone and estrogen and reductions in fertility
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.020]   that occur if we don't get enough sleep,
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.840]   but seldom is it discussed how sleep actually adjusts
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.720]   things like testosterone and estrogen,
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.000]   and it does it by modifying cortisol.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.920]   So the molecule cholesterol can be converted
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   into testosterone or estrogen,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.600]   but there's a competition whereby the cholesterol
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.920]   will turn into cortisol and not testosterone,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.680]   or it'll turn into cortisol and not estrogen
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.660]   if stress levels are too high.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.600]   So the simple version of this is getting your breathing
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:26.040]   right during the waking hours, meaning primarily,
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.840]   unless you're working out really hard
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.100]   or there's some other reason why you're maybe eating
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.080]   or speaking that you need to be breathing through your mouth,
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.600]   you should be a nose breather.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.080]   There's really good evidence for that now.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.960]   And in sleep, you also want to be a nose breather
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.620]   because that's going to increase the amount of oxygen
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   that you're bringing into your system
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.460]   and the amount of carbon dioxide that you're offloading.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.280]   There are other positive effects of it as well,
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.420]   but you're basically reducing apnea.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.080]   Breath holding in sleep leads to buildup of carbon dioxide
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.020]   and leads to increases in cortisol,
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.000]   which then decrease testosterone and decrease estrogen
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.340]   in negative ways across all sexes, okay?
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.000]   So the simple version of this is get your breathing right.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.840]   So how do you do that?
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:05.820]   How do you get your breathing right?
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.800]   Well, for some people that have severe sleep apnea,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.560]   they're going to need the CPAP machine.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.260]   This is a machine that you actually put on your face
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.580]   and it helps you breathe properly in sleep.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.740]   Many people, however, are starting to do this thing
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.820]   of taping their mouth shut.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.000]   Now, this sounds a little bit extreme
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.560]   and you certainly don't want to do this
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.620]   in any way that's dangerous.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.340]   James Nestor talked about this in his book,
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.480]   "Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art,"
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.380]   that simply taping shut the mouth with some tape
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.960]   that will allow you to open your mouth if you really need to
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.060]   during sleep can allow people to shift over
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.540]   from being mouth breathers and snorers to nose breathers.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.420]   In the daytime, the best way to get good at nasal breathing
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.140]   is to dilate the nasal passages
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.500]   'cause a lot of people have a hard time
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.220]   breathing through their nose.
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.560]   And one way to do this
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.340]   is to just breathe through your nose more.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.660]   And one way to do that is that when you exercise,
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.820]   in particular cardiovascular exercise,
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.560]   most of the time, provided you're not in maximum effort,
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.260]   you should be nasal breathing.
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.840]   Now, for a lot of people,
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.420]   nasal breathing during exercise is hard at first,
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.440]   but as you do it,
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.320]   because the sinuses have a capacity to dilate over time,
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.880]   you'll get better at it.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.920]   The sinuses, if you haven't ever held a skull,
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.640]   because of my job as a neuroscientist,
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   I've held a lot of skulls,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.180]   taken a lot of brains out of a lot of skulls,
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.760]   teach neuroanatomy and have done that for, goodness,
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.420]   God knows how many species I've done that for,
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.260]   including human.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:30.120]   But what the sinuses are is they're actually,
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.440]   what you've got are you've got these little portals
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.640]   in the bone that run up here and down here
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.760]   behind the nose and into the jaw.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.780]   If you ever had a cold and your sinuses are stuffed up,
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.280]   you feel like you have congestion here and here
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.560]   and around your ears and in your cheeks and in your face.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.780]   And that's because the sinuses are actually portals
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:50.860]   where the bones are fused together,
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.760]   kind of interdigitate like this,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.960]   but they're lined, of course, with mucus membranes.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.060]   And as you start to nasal breathe more,
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.220]   the nasal passages will start to dilate more.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.240]   Don't worry, you're not going to get giant nostrils.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.680]   But what's going to end up happening
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.100]   is you're going to have an easier time breathing
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.180]   through your nose just from waking.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.660]   So my advice would be breathe through your nose
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.800]   while exercising, unless you're in maximum effort.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.240]   Pretty soon, what you'll find is you actually can
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.020]   create more output than you would
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.520]   if you were breathing through your mouth.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.060]   And of course, there are exceptions to this.
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.460]   If you're swimming, follow that breath protocol.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.880]   For fighters and martial artists,
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.720]   there's reason to do the kind of exhale breathing
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.600]   through the mouth, the shh kind of thing.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.480]   There are reasons to do that sort of thing
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.160]   for particular sports, but for most people
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.060]   who are kind of recreational athletes or exercisers,
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.480]   learn to be a nasal breather.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.760]   It has positive cosmetic effects, it reduces apnea,
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.040]   it offloads more carbon dioxide, it increases lung capacity,
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.440]   it dilates the sinuses, and it prevents apnea in sleep.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.640]   So unless you have severe apnea and you need the CPAP,
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.740]   becoming a nasal breather can have all sorts
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.880]   of positive effects by reducing cortisol,
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.120]   reducing apnea, and indirectly,
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.720]   raising testosterone and estrogen in the proper ratios.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.080]   So this might seem kind of foundational and indirect,
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.260]   but when you go into the scientific literature,
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.100]   it comes through as one of the most powerful things
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.320]   that you can do that is zero cost,
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.560]   takes a little effort, but at zero cost,
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.760]   and it has all these positive effects across the board,
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.780]   both cosmetic and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.680]   So that's the first piece of behavioral advice.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.440]   The second piece of behavioral advice
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.540]   relates to the viewing of light.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.160]   And many of you have heard me talk about this before,
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.040]   and I'm not going to belabor the point
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.360]   that viewing bright light within the first hour of waking,
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.680]   whether or not it's from artificial light
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.960]   or ideally from sunlight,
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.060]   has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.960]   But we have to return to this if you want to understand
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.000]   how light can impact hormones,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.200]   because hormones, light and dopamine
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.020]   have a very close-knit relationship,
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.400]   so much so that your light viewing behavior
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.520]   can actually have a direct effect
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.720]   on hormone levels and fertility.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.360]   It can have a direct effect on hormone levels and libido.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.980]   It can have a direct effect on hormone levels
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.800]   and your ability to heal quickly.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.320]   And I'm not talking about shining light
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.420]   on particular injuries,
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.520]   that may or may not have positive effects.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.820]   We can argue about that on a subsequent episode, it may,
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.320]   but what I'm talking about is viewing light with your eyes.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.560]   So let's talk about that now
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:26.440]   because the scientific literature on this are robust
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.400]   and they extend back several decades,
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.920]   and yet I think most people don't really understand
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.400]   how powerful this relationship is
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.160]   between light, dopamine, hormones,
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.680]   and all the great things that the sex steroid hormones do
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.980]   when they're available in your body in the proper ratios.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.920]   In order to understand the powerful effects
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.740]   that light can have on the sex steroid hormones,
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:49.020]   we need to understand seasonal breeding animals.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.160]   Now, humans are not seasonal breeders,
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.800]   but if you understand the biology
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.360]   of how light impacts various neurotransmitters and hormones,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.280]   you'll set yourself up for a deep understanding
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.000]   of what you should do with your light viewing behavior.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.640]   So several species of animals,
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.600]   many species of animals, in fact,
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.880]   like rabbits and fox and various mustelids,
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.360]   like ferrets and ermines,
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:14.960]   change their pelage color across the seasons.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.800]   This might be kind of a duh,
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.660]   but fox in winter are often white or light gray,
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:25.140]   and those same animals will be brown or darker colored
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.340]   in the summertime and spring months.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.700]   Now, those same animals breed in the spring,
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.380]   and they shut down breeding.
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.860]   They actually shut down ovulation.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.320]   They often shut down testosterone production
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.900]   in the winter months.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:41.180]   So right now I'm just correlating color of fur
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.140]   with tendency to breed.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.460]   Tendency to breed, as we know,
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.920]   is going to be related to the levels of sex steroid hormones,
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.400]   estrogen and testosterone.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.280]   Now, why would these two things be linked?
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.880]   Well, it turns out that dopamine is the link between them.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.520]   So dopamine has a precursor.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.640]   That precursor is tyrosine,
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.600]   which is an amino acid, comes from food.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.960]   And when dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.240]   there's a tendency for more gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.280]   luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.240]   all the hormones that come
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.600]   from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.360]   and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.960]   from the ovary and testes.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.500]   Dopamine basically increases all of that.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.660]   The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine,
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.460]   but the precursor to a lot
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.300]   of the melanin-producing elements of cells
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:36.500]   that give pigmentation, including for the hair,
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:41.280]   is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.440]   So yes, the same amino acid-based pathway
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.760]   and many of the same enzymes
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.420]   that are devoted to dopamine
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:54.480]   and dopamine-increasing the sex steroid hormones are devoted
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.420]   to giving pigmentation to the hair and skin.
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:02.940]   And this is why in the summer months, when days are longer,
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.280]   animals are breeding more.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.560]   And this is also why in the winter months,
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.640]   when days are shorter, animals are breeding less.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.720]   This is also why in humans, many people, not all,
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.800]   feel an elevation and mood in the spring and summer months
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.160]   because of the amount of sunlight they're getting
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.380]   is increased relative to the winter months.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.360]   Now, some of you may be saying,
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.400]   "I love the fall, I love the winter."
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.860]   Sensitivity to light in these dopamine systems
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.160]   has a strong genetic component.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.440]   So you go to some areas of the world,
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.080]   I have relatives who are Scandinavian,
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.320]   and in some areas of Scandinavia,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.000]   people know that there's a kind of seasonal affective disorder
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.720]   that's kind of a seasonal depression,
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.460]   and people get sadder and more quiescent in the winter.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.620]   There's actually less going out,
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.780]   and therefore there's less sexual behavior,
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.560]   there's less partying and things of that sort.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.880]   But other people will say,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.040]   "No, during the winter months, I feel great,
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.960]   and I love the holidays around winter," et cetera.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.560]   So there's a lot of variation.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.400]   But in general, the pathway is the following.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.300]   Increased viewing of sunlight,
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.900]   and it has to be to the eyes, it's not to the skin,
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.780]   increased viewing of sunlight,
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.180]   increases dopamine levels in the brain,
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.840]   increased dopamine levels in animals and humans,
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.320]   increases the amount of these melanocytes
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.780]   and the activity of these melanin-producing cells,
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.700]   which give pigmentation to the skin and hair,
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.760]   and indirectly increase the amount
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.720]   of testosterone and estrogen
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.240]   and thereby reproductive behavior, feelings of wellbeing,
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.360]   social interactions, reductions, anxiety, et cetera,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.420]   all of which should make sense
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.540]   based on what we've talked about already
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.140]   in terms of the biology
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.900]   and the impact of these steroid hormones
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.420]   on various aspects of the mind and body.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.000]   So how does this translate to a protocol?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.020]   This translates to the protocol of,
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.380]   if you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen,
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.020]   you need to get your light viewing behavior correct.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.960]   It's not just about optimizing your sleep,
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.000]   which is also important,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.740]   it's about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.100]   so you have sufficient levels of dopamine.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.100]   So the simple protocols for that I've reviewed before,
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.220]   but it means getting anywhere from two to 10 minutes
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.980]   of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.700]   It is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.500]   unless you have to do that for safety reasons.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.140]   It's fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.100]   If you can't get sunlight for whatever reason,
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.900]   you want to use bright artificial light,
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.900]   but that is absolutely critical
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.300]   for timing the cortisol release properly,
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.860]   limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day,
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:33.380]   getting increases in dopamine
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.460]   that are going to promote the production
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.100]   of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.800]   The other aspect of light viewing behavior
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.340]   that's extremely important
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.500]   is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.620]   in the middle of the night.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.460]   If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night,
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.440]   you are suppressing dopamine release.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.180]   If you're suppressing dopamine release,
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.020]   you are suppressing testosterone levels.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.100]   So much so that I would wager
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.820]   that a major effect of sleep deprivation
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:04.040]   on reducing testosterone and estrogen
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.700]   is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se,
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.140]   it's because usually when people
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.440]   are not getting enough sleep,
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.560]   they're getting too much light in their eyes
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.620]   in the middle of the night as well.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.660]   A study on this has not been completed yet,
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.420]   but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.540]   both cell press journals, excellent journals,
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.780]   showing that viewing bright light with the eyes
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.380]   in the middle of the circadian night
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.820]   has a detrimental effect on dopamine
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.460]   and therefore has a detrimental effect
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.740]   on things like testosterone and estrogen.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.160]   So you can't even begin to talk about supplements
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.460]   and other ways to optimize testosterone diet
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.180]   and its effects on testosterone and estrogen
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.020]   and fertility and reproductive behavior, et cetera,
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.880]   until you get your breathing right,
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.420]   until you get things like your light viewing behavior right.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.940]   So bright light early in the day
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.080]   and throughout the day is great.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.140]   View as much bright light, ideally sunlight, as you can,
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.600]   as much as you safely can.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.740]   You obviously don't want to burn your retinas
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.580]   or damage your retinas,
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.360]   so never look at any light that's so bright
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.640]   it's painful to look at.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.260]   But getting a lot of light in your eyes
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.600]   is not just about adjusting your sleep-wake rhythms,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.560]   it's also about optimizing your sex steroid hormones.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.360]   And avoiding bright light in the middle of the night
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.180]   is not just about not disrupting your sleep,
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.440]   it's also about optimizing the sex steroid hormones.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.220]   And now that you understand a bit
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.540]   of how the sex steroid hormones work
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.940]   and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.720]   and all these other effects,
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.680]   this should be straightforward to do,
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.040]   or hopefully it's inspired you
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.580]   to get your light viewing behavior
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.560]   and your breathing behavior correct.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.880]   In fact, in thinking about tools,
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.340]   for many people that are suffering
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.420]   from low levels of estrogen if they want higher levels,
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:41.340]   or low levels of testosterone if they want higher levels,
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.520]   just getting the breathing and light viewing behavior,
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.360]   which will indirectly support sleep behavior,
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.500]   can be a huge and positive effect
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.720]   on levels of sex steroid hormones.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.600]   I can already anticipate that in hearing this,
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.000]   you might wonder whether or not viewing light
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.480]   is going to, for instance, increase your testosterone a lot
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.720]   when in fact you want your estrogen increased,
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.680]   or it's going to increase your estrogen a lot
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.420]   when you want your testosterone increased.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.520]   Everything I'm describing here is for people,
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.180]   regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background.
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.880]   So I'm trying to basically offer all this information
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.820]   in one swoop.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.960]   But basically, if you're somebody who naturally has ovaries
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.560]   and has higher levels of estrogen than testosterone,
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.920]   then viewing bright light early in the day
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   because of dopamine's effects
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.960]   is going to promote more estrogen
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   and subtle increases in testosterone.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.600]   Whereas if you're somebody who starts off
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.200]   with more testosterone and lower estrogen,
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.440]   so somebody presumably who has testes,
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.360]   or maybe you're supplementing with testosterone
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360]   through other sources for whatever reason,
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.440]   bright light viewing is going to increase testosterone
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.320]   and estrogen in parallel,
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.720]   but you're still going to maintain
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.600]   the ratio of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.060]   In short, you don't have to worry
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.840]   that you're going to increase the wrong hormone.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.040]   This is all about optimizing the ratios of hormones
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.800]   that you already have.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.380]   Okay, so we've talked about breathing.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.920]   We've talked about light.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.280]   Let's talk about a third element
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.840]   that there seems to be some excitement about lately
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.940]   for other reasons,
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.420]   but that can actually have some pretty profound influences
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:19.160]   on hormone levels, and that's heat and cold.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.800]   So as always, rather than just offer a tool,
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.040]   I'm going to tell you the underlying science
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.340]   as it relates to naturally occurring phenomenon,
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:27.680]   because in understanding that
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.160]   and understanding the mechanism,
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.480]   you're going to be in a far better position
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.680]   to understand the tools and mechanisms
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.720]   and how you might want to adjust them for your own life.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.120]   So now you understand the relationship
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.120]   between light, day length, dopamine, and hormone levels,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.520]   and everyone should realize
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.000]   that temperature and day length are linked,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.060]   and I'm sure as I say that,
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.120]   you're probably thinking, oh, of course.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.880]   In summer, when there's more sunlight,
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.480]   days are longer, nights are shorter,
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.400]   in general, it tends to be warmer out,
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.760]   and in winter, when nights are longer, days are shorter,
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.780]   it tends to be colder out.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.760]   And in the winter months,
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.680]   testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower in many animals
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.880]   and in humans, and in the summer months,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.360]   because of the role of dopamine
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.960]   in promoting the sex steroid hormones,
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.800]   when days are longer and it's warmer,
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   humans tend to make more estrogen and testosterone
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.220]   relative to the other months of the year.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.360]   Now, these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated,
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.800]   as opposed to in seasonally breathing animals
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.120]   where they're really dramatic, okay?
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   But the point is that temperature and day length
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.180]   and sunlight, those are all intimately related
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.780]   because of the systems that we evolved in, right?
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.280]   So before we had artificial light
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.720]   and artificial heating and artificial cooling,
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.840]   our biology evolved under systems where temperature,
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.080]   day length, and the hormones
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.120]   were correlated with one another.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.060]   So nowadays, there's a lot of interest
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.940]   in using cold as a way to stimulate testosterone.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:03.280]   This is mainly because in the sports community,
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.520]   in particular in the bodybuilding community,
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.580]   they are always seeking ways to maximize testosterone,
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.000]   dihydrotestosterone, keep estrogen to its minimum required
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.060]   to still have libido and still have skin elasticity,
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.480]   but also walk around with saran wrap skin,
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.520]   then all this kind of extreme stuff that happens there
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.640]   has led to a recent movement where, believe it or not,
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.800]   I heard this and I couldn't believe I went and checked,
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.840]   although I didn't buy them,
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.000]   that on Amazon, you can actually find,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.200]   people have their literally underwear that have ice packs,
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.800]   or I think they're ice pack underwear,
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.280]   so that people are making themselves cold
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.620]   at the level of the gonads
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.600]   in order to try and increase testosterone and libido.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.040]   Sounds pretty crazy, but believe it or not,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.760]   that and things like ice baths and cold showers
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.160]   can have positive effects on the sex steroid hormones,
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.200]   both testosterone, mainly in males,
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.880]   and estrogen, mainly in females.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.560]   And you might say, wait,
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.960]   I thought cold makes the reproductive axis
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.260]   kind of shut down a bit or reduces testosterone and estrogen,
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.720]   but it turns out it's not actually the cold
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720]   that's having these effects in people.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.160]   Things like the ice bath, cold showers, cold water swims,
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.900]   these ice underwear, whatever they are,
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.900]   can't believe that these actually exist, but they do exist.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.240]   What happens is there's a rebound in vasodilation
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.200]   after cooling, so cooling causes vasoconstriction,
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.840]   and then after the cooling,
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.260]   there's a rebound vasodilation,
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.700]   and there's more infusion of blood into the gonads.
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.440]   There's also an effect that's neural.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.340]   So let me explain how this works,
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:43.480]   because there are only a few studies on this,
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.180]   none of which looking at the frozen underwear,
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.820]   but that have looked at cold exposure
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.040]   and levels of androgens and estrogens,
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.600]   and it's kind of interesting.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.840]   So you have to remember that the gonad,
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.540]   the ovaries and the testes are heavily vascularized.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.520]   Remember, even at the level of the brain,
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.760]   GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.960]   comes from neurons that, believe it or not,
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.120]   start off in your nose early in development,
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.360]   migrate into the hypothalamus, I'm not making that up,
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.920]   they started off in your nose, migrate into the hypothalamus.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.660]   Those neurons extend processes,
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.600]   we call them axons, into the pituitary
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.720]   and release GnRH into the pituitary.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.380]   There's a lot of vascularization within the pituitary,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.680]   so now those hormones, or GnRH,
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.820]   can stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone,
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.660]   luteinizing hormone, which then are released
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   and travel into the bloodstream.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.480]   Then those hormones reach the ovary or testes,
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.480]   and they have to get into the ovary and testes.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.120]   And the way they do that is through the vascular system.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.880]   And people forget, but the vascular system
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.800]   and how constricted or dilated vessels are
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.880]   is controlled by neurons, right?
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.960]   This is, we discussed this during the discussion
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.260]   about stress in the stress episode,
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.400]   but it's well-known to neuroscientists
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.300]   that the best way to shut down neurons is to cool them.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.440]   So there are a lot of examples of this
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.520]   in the scientific literature,
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.580]   but most people aren't aware of it
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:09.720]   'cause you're not digging around
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.300]   in the methods section of these papers,
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.200]   but when we want to shut down neurons,
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.920]   we can do things like inject drugs
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.640]   that will do that, like lidocaine,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.180]   the stuff that makes you numb at the dentist,
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.800]   or you can use different inhibitors.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.960]   But one of the best ways to do it experimentally
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.320]   is to just cool neurons.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.600]   When you make neurons cold,
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.280]   because there's a temperature dependence
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.600]   of when neurons can be active and when they can't,
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.320]   the neurons shut down.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.300]   So the most plausible explanation for why cold exposure,
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.120]   either through one to 10-minute ice bath or cold shower
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.640]   or the ice underpants thing, would increase testosterone
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.160]   or increase estrogen, is that you're cooling the neurons
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.440]   that control vasoconstriction and vasodilation
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.240]   and shutting down the entry of blood,
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.960]   or at least reducing it, and hormones into the gonad.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.200]   And then when the gonad and the surrounding area
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.320]   heats up again, you're getting a rebound hypervasodilation
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.760]   that delivers excessive levels of, not excessive,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.360]   but increased levels of GnRH and other hormones
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.300]   and carriers and carrier proteins and so forth
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.280]   that would then stimulate the gonad
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.080]   to release more testosterone,
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.840]   or would stimulate the gonad to release more estrogen.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.680]   That's the most plausible explanation I can come up with.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.220]   There aren't a lot of studies looking at direct effects
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.760]   of temperature on the gonad,
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.800]   and it's going to be a difficult study
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.520]   to carry out in any case,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.940]   because unless they were done in vitro in a dish,
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.040]   it's very hard to eliminate all the other things
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.260]   like vasoconstriction and vasodilation.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.920]   Put simply, we don't know whether or not cold and heat
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.640]   directly affect the production of testosterone and estrogen.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.320]   We only know that cold and heat can modulate those,
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.060]   probably through indirect mechanisms
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.980]   like controlling the amount of blood flow
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.880]   by way of shutting down or activating the neurons.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.340]   Now, there's a lot of lore
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:02.120]   around heating up the gonads too much.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   There's actually a whole set of pseudoscience web pages
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.840]   out there saying, "Well, if you want a girl,
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.580]   "you should conceive the child at this room temperature,
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:13.420]   "and if you want a boy,
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.640]   "you should conceive the child at this room temperature."
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.920]   I don't think there's really
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.440]   any firm scientific evidence for that, for either one,
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.980]   but there's some interesting literature
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.280]   about temperature dependence of production of hormones,
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.720]   and I think that it probably relates to these mechanisms
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.300]   of vasodilation and neural control over vasodilation.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.400]   And of course, excessively high heat is not good
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.000]   for the testes, for sperm production, or for sperm health.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.140]   Sperm have all sorts of proteins in the cap,
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.080]   things like pentraxins and other things
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.540]   that cause them to swim faster
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.240]   when they're expressed properly and in the right locations,
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.720]   and heat actually alters the location
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.480]   and the function of a lot of those proteins.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.960]   They're very heat sensitive,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.360]   and so that's why excessive heat
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.780]   is truly not good for fertility,
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.320]   which may be independent of heat's roles
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.760]   in promoting estrogen or testosterone.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.640]   Okay, so now we've talked about breathing,
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.200]   light, and temperature.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.520]   We talked about parenthood.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.560]   We talked about competition,
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.900]   and we talked about some pheromone effects.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.140]   Now let's talk about particular forms of exercise
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.500]   and how they modulate the steroid hormones,
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:22.100]   and then we're going to talk about various supplements,
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.140]   both in reference to testosterone
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.040]   and in reference to estrogen.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.640]   So now let's talk about how exercise in its various forms,
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.280]   weight training, endurance work, weight training to failure,
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.320]   or less intense weight training,
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.820]   can impact testosterone levels.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.960]   But I want to remind you
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.520]   that we're talking about testosterone,
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.520]   both in males and females.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.480]   And based on what you know from earlier in the episode,
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.960]   testosterone can have numerous positive effects
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.240]   in both males and females,
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.180]   provided they're in optimal range.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.400]   So if you look on the web, people will say,
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.200]   oh, you know, testosterone is increased by weight training.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.980]   You want to do big, heavy compound movements,
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.280]   squats and deadlifts and chins and things of that sort.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.720]   But what about the scientific studies?
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.340]   Like what's the actual basis for this?
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.560]   'Cause if you just take a step back
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.640]   and look at this from the perspective of a scientist,
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   you'd say, okay, what is a squat?
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.240]   A squat is loading up a bunch of weights on a bar
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.280]   and then, you know, sitting down essentially
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.120]   and standing up over and over again.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.840]   What's a deadlift?
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.520]   It's lifting heavy weights from the ground.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.000]   Why would that increase testosterone, right?
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.540]   This is what's often not discussed in the weight training
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.240]   or even the exercise science community.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.000]   What would actually stimulate the release of testosterone
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.840]   from the adrenals and/or testes?
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.480]   And which one is it, adrenals or testes or both?
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.460]   And that's often not discussed, but as a neuroscientist,
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.740]   this is the kinds of things we think about
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:43.160]   'cause we think always that genes don't create behavior,
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.320]   immune systems don't know when to be activated,
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.220]   lungs don't know when to inhale or exhale,
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.520]   hearts don't know when to beat
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:52.460]   except for the information that it gets from neurons.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.040]   The nervous system controls all of that.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.720]   And so really the answer has to be in the neural system
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.200]   that's related to these particular types
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.220]   of weight-bearing exercises.
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:07.020]   So when you go into this literature,
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.480]   it's kind of hard to find real mechanism.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.720]   You see a lot of effects.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.360]   You'll hear things like androgen receptor content,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.560]   meaning testosterone and its derivatives,
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.360]   receptor content following heavy resistance exercise.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.760]   And you'll find some examples that, for instance,
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.300]   you know, they do muscle biopsies.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.120]   They can actually see receptor increases
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.220]   looking at either high volume or low volume,
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.560]   really intense exercise.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.960]   And you can find a lot of that,
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.520]   but not a lot of mechanism
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.040]   about how the nervous system would do this.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.240]   And the reason you'd want to know how it can do it
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.880]   is that you could potentially build better protocols
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.400]   or figure out exactly what about these movements
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.280]   is triggering increases in androgen receptors
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.080]   and testosterone.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.920]   So what's interesting is when you start digging
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.320]   into the more mechanistic studies,
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.360]   what you find is that heavy weight training,
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.200]   so this is weight training where the sets are done
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.680]   with anywhere from, you know, kind of one to eight rep range.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.280]   So this translates differently
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.000]   depending on ratio of muscle fiber type and so forth,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.240]   but where basically people are working at anywhere
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.360]   from like 70% to 95% of their maximum
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.760]   or sometimes even going right down
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.400]   to their one repetition maximum,
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.160]   really kind of, you know, max effort.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.440]   What you find is that using the nervous system
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.740]   in a way in which they're moving heavy loads,
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.020]   so that I would translate to recruitment
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.320]   of high threshold motor units for you muscle physiologists.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.560]   And there's a rule in muscle physiology
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.360]   about the neuron recruitment for moving muscles
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.200]   where you basically use the minimum number of motor units
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.160]   of neurons to activate muscle as you possibly can.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.440]   As loads increase, you have to recruit more and more neurons.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.520]   You always hear about recruiting muscle fibers,
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.240]   but really it's recruiting more neurons
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.040]   to recruit more muscle fibers.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.240]   And what you find is that heavy weight training,
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.460]   but not weight training to failure
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.740]   where completion of a repetition is impossible
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.520]   leads to the greatest increases in testosterone.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.940]   Now, I'm sure there are a bunch of exercise jockeys out there
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.880]   that are going to come at me with a bunch of things
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.140]   where, oh yeah, but high volume and this
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.600]   and training to failure and that, sure.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.360]   If you're willing to kind of put things side by side,
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.480]   adjust for exogenous testosterone treatment
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.040]   and all the rest, which was done in these studies,
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.880]   what you find in general is that weight training
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.100]   with heavy loads, so anywhere from one rep maximum
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.860]   to somewhere in the six to eight repetition range
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:39.840]   in males or females increases testosterone significantly.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.100]   And it does it for about a day, sometimes up to 48 hours.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.580]   And the studies that I found,
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:48.780]   which seem to hold the most rigor or weight
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:49.920]   based on where they're published
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.240]   as opposed to being published in the journal,
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.080]   never heard of it.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.580]   They're published in good quality
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.160]   exercise physiology journals.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.280]   For instance, the paper by Ratames, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S, et al,
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.420]   which was published in 2005,
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   which talks about modulations in androgen receptor content
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:10.920]   after heavy resistance exercise,
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.560]   looks at going to failure, not to failure.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.560]   The work of Sciardo et al, published in 2006,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.300]   differential effects of strength training
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:21.880]   leading to failure versus not failure
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.760]   on hormonal responses, strength, and power gains.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.960]   There are a lot of studies here,
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.500]   and I will certainly put the links to these in the caption.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.800]   Many of these actually include Duncan French,
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.160]   who runs the UFC Training Center,
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.680]   who I've had the privilege of meeting
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.180]   and discussing some of this with before,
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.880]   as well as other authors, of course.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.920]   But they all point to the fact that there's something
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.520]   about the engagement of the neurons
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   that recruit high threshold motor units in muscle
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.320]   when moving heavy loads, but not to failure,
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.280]   that has to provide some sort of feedback signal
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.720]   either to the gonad to produce more testosterone
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:01.600]   or is increasing the activity of receptors in the body.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.200]   Now, why do I say that?
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.360]   Well, this is the puzzle, right?
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.880]   How is it that a particular movement,
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.300]   just like how is it that interacting with your child
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.740]   is increasing or decreasing testosterone?
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.240]   This is the kind of fundamental question
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.720]   at the mechanistic level.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.080]   And we answered the question for child rearing.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.660]   It has probably something to do with smell and pheromones,
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.760]   although I'm sure there are other cues as well.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:26.760]   But there's clearly a influence of hard work
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.120]   at the neural level and then at the muscular level
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.120]   for increasing testosterone.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.400]   And there's also clearly an effect of working too hard
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.280]   and presumably increasing cortisol too much,
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.800]   although I'm speculating there,
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.320]   in terms of reducing testosterone.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.880]   And so the reason we're getting nitty gritty about this
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.840]   is because ultimately we'd really like to understand
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.240]   what are the optimal protocols?
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.100]   You know, out there in the literature you hear,
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.480]   move heavy objects to increase testosterone.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.560]   Some of that will be converted
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.500]   to the more powerful androgen, DHT,
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.680]   by 5-alpha reductase, et cetera.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.980]   But we really don't understand yet
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.720]   how these particular behaviors increase testosterone
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.060]   and whether or not it's doing that
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.620]   by modulating the receptors
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.760]   or it's modulating testosterone release directly,
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.600]   presumably testosterone release directly
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.640]   and sensitivity of the receptors.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.680]   That's what most of the muscle physiology studies
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.480]   that I was able to find point to.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.800]   But this basically boils down
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.500]   to a particular set of protocols
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.640]   where if you want to increase testosterone
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.200]   for whatever reason,
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.800]   that weight training with heavy loads,
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.340]   but not to failure seems to be the best supported,
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.380]   at least scientifically supported solution to that.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.320]   Now, it may not raise your testosterone levels
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.400]   as high as you want,
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.660]   but it's definitely taking things in the correct direction.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.020]   Now, many of you might be endurance athletes
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:46.880]   or also enjoy exercise besides heavy weight-bearing exercise.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.280]   And there are several studies exploring
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.460]   whether or not endurance activity
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:55.800]   can increase or decrease androgen levels,
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.240]   and whether or not you combine
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.120]   endurance activity and weight training,
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.680]   whether or not that has any effect
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.760]   if you do the endurance activity first or second.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.040]   And the takeaway from all of this
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.880]   was that endurance activity, if performed first,
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.660]   leads to decreases in testosterone
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.520]   during the weight training session,
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.180]   as compared to the same weight training session done first,
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.520]   followed by endurance activity.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.420]   In other words, if you want to optimize testosterone levels,
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.900]   it seems to be the case that weight training first
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:27.380]   and doing cardio type endurance activity afterward
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.320]   is the right order of business.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.960]   Now, when these are done on separate days,
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.800]   it doesn't seem to have an effect.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.120]   They showed no statistical interaction.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.020]   But it seems that if you're going to do these
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.200]   in the same workout episode,
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.420]   that it's move heavy loads first,
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.880]   then do cardiovascular exercise.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.400]   So there's a little bit of data looking specifically
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.560]   at how endurance exercise impacts testosterone
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.560]   and its derivatives.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.160]   And it's very clear that high-intensity interval training,
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.360]   sprinting, et cetera,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.160]   which somewhat mimics the neural activity
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.060]   that occurs while moving heavy weight loads,
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.120]   is going to increase testosterone.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.800]   There's ample evidence for that in the literature.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.560]   And that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.000]   is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.240]   presumably by increases in cortisol.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.800]   But of course, the intensity of the exercise
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.560]   is going to be important too.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.860]   No one ever, I don't think anyone really believes
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.160]   that hiking for the three hours
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.240]   is going to reduce your testosterone.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.400]   Whereas I think if one were to go out
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.320]   and run hard for three hours,
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.660]   that you can imagine there'd be reductions in testosterone
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.560]   by way of increases in cortisol.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.600]   And so while this area certainly needs more research,
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.140]   it's pretty clear that limiting the endurance exercise
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.100]   to 75 minutes or less, not making it too intense,
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.660]   is one way to keep cortisol from going through the roof.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.240]   But I've talked on previous episodes,
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.020]   and there are a lot of others who have talked out there
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.380]   about how to clamp cortisol,
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.540]   how to keep cortisol more reduced.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:56.460]   This is also one of the reasons why you can imagine
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.080]   that various individuals, either for competition
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.860]   or just for their own purposes,
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.980]   rely on testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone,
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:07.500]   not just for weight training, but for endurance exercise.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.740]   So this is one of the reasons why every once in a while,
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.260]   professional cyclists will get popped
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.020]   for performance in hectic drugs, I mean, they'll get caught.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.620]   And it's not just that they're increasing red blood cells
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:18.500]   through EPO and things of that sort.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.540]   Oftentimes they're also taking testosterone,
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.540]   not because they want to be large
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.960]   or have massively hypertrophied muscles,
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.060]   but because they're injecting testosterone,
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.220]   they don't have to worry about
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.780]   cortisol-induced reductions in testosterone.
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.380]   They can just clamp or keep their testosterone levels high.
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:35.780]   Not something I'm recommending,
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.020]   but I'm just justifying the rationale
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:41.180]   for why an endurance athlete would want to do that at all.
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.060]   So now let's switch over to talking about estrogen.
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.580]   So there are many people who are trying
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:48.760]   to optimize their estrogen levels.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.780]   And one of the places where this shows up a lot,
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.580]   and I get a lot of questions about, is menopause.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.440]   So menopause, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.860]   is this fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.900]   that is circulating in one's blood,
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:05.900]   mainly because the ovary is now depleted
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.020]   of some estrogen production of its own,
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.720]   the eggs are not being produced,
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.980]   they've been depleted, et cetera.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.620]   So menopause is characterized by a variety of symptoms.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.780]   And it's multifaceted,
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.060]   probably deserves an entire episode on its own,
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:23.300]   but things like hot flashes, things like mood swings,
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.600]   things like headaches, in particular, migraine headaches.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.300]   There can be a lot of brain fog.
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.500]   It can be very, very disruptive for people.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.260]   Now you sometimes hear about andropause,
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.120]   which is thought to be the kind of analog to menopause,
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.400]   but menopause has certain characteristics
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   that make it a very robust phenomenon for most women.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.620]   Whereas for men,
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.540]   andropause is going to sometimes happen, sometimes won't.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.580]   In fact, without going into the details
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.860]   of the graphs and the data,
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.580]   it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.780]   that some men maintain levels of circulating androgens
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:00.900]   that are quite high, even as similar as they were in puberty
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:02.600]   and their teen years and 20s,
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.660]   well into their 60s, 70s, and 80s,
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.540]   if they're optimizing a lot of other things,
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:09.180]   and probably genetics plays a role as well,
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.920]   whereas some males won't,
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.660]   but within the female population
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.320]   or population of individuals that have ovaries,
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:20.060]   there's a very stereotyped and characteristic reduction
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.880]   in estrogen levels as the number of eggs becomes depleted,
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.440]   and that's what we think of as menopause.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.420]   So what are the various things
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.000]   that one can do for menopause?
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.620]   Well, one of the most common ones
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.020]   is that physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:37.780]   So this is hormone therapy
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.860]   where somebody takes either their oral estrogen
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:42.060]   or they'll use a patch or a pellet,
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.460]   some way to secrete estradiol into the system,
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.320]   and that has varying success depending on the individual.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.000]   Some people respond very well to it.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.260]   Other people really have challenges with it,
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.340]   and there are a lot of side effects associated with it
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.620]   for some people, not others.
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.860]   In addition,
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.860]   there's a concern always about supplementing estrogen
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:06.160]   when there's a breast cancer background in the family,
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.220]   or there's concern about breast cancer for any reason,
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:11.100]   because a lot of those cancers are estrogen dependent,
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:15.180]   and that's why drugs like tamoxifen and anastrozole
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.040]   and drugs that block either aromatase
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.260]   or block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.020]   were initially developed.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.560]   You see them a lot on the internet,
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.380]   again, for all the sports folks
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.260]   who are trying to increase testosterone and reduce estrogen,
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.400]   but remember, those drugs were initially developed
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.040]   as ways to prevent estrogen binding
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:39.140]   to the estrogen receptor as cancer treatments.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.700]   So I want to be very clear, and I've said this many times,
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.780]   we always put in the caption of each episode, of course,
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.220]   that I'm not a physician, I'm not an MD,
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.820]   I don't prescribe anything, I'm a professor,
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.300]   I profess things, I'm here to translate
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.900]   the scientific literature and point to
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.720]   what might be some useful avenues for exploration,
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.300]   but this is just for information purposes.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.300]   You should definitely talk to your doctor
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.120]   about anything that I'm talking about now,
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.380]   or in any episode for that matter.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:06.220]   So if you look at the literature on menopause
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:10.120]   outside of just standard estrogen therapy,
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.900]   there are some very interesting compounds out there
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:15.180]   that have been used and that are supported
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:17.420]   by quality peer-reviewed studies.
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:19.420]   And again, I'll refer you once again
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.700]   to this amazing website, examine.com,
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:24.300]   where you can put in essentially any condition
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.720]   or any supplement and it will point you
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.420]   to the human effect matrix, not animal studies,
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:32.180]   but human studies that have explored these things.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.340]   Now, there are a huge variety of them here,
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:35.840]   so I won't go into all of them,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.840]   but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.200]   that have been shown to be powerful
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.300]   in the context of menopause, as well as other conditions
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.960]   where estrogen is lower than one would like,
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.320]   include a description and some of the literature,
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.380]   I'll get into this in a moment,
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.920]   of something like black cohosh,
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.560]   I think that's the correct pronunciation,
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.960]   it's literally the word black and then C-O-H-O-S-H.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.640]   And it's very interesting,
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.820]   there are 13 peer-reviewed studies
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.380]   that have reached prominence
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.060]   in the kind of commercial landscape
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:12.540]   where this substance, black cohosh,
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.120]   has been promoted as a way to increase estrogen.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.320]   Turns out that the effects are consistent,
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.260]   but are fairly minor, fairly minor increases in estrogen.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:25.080]   So it does seem to be a real effect,
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.980]   it is significant over the placebo effect,
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:30.920]   but there's also a significant placebo effect
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.700]   in some of these studies as well.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.700]   So what's interesting when you look at these studies
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.040]   is that many of them were carried out
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.400]   over a period of six plus months,
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.440]   they're double-blind studies, et cetera,
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.820]   and almost all of them led to modest increases in estrogen
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:51.820]   and modest decreases in menopause-related symptoms.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.240]   Now, a few additional details about these studies,
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:00.580]   they were generally carried out on women age 45 to 64.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.320]   In some cases, they look specifically at women
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.160]   that were clinically obese or overweight,
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.040]   although not always.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.500]   The subject size pools are pretty big,
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:12.080]   anywhere from 50 to 87,
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.080]   these are decent size, 132 subjects, et cetera.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.180]   So these look to be like quality studies,
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.360]   and they basically point to the fact
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.560]   that black cohosh can have a modest effect
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.040]   in improving menopause symptoms.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:30.040]   The other one is Panax ginseng, so P-N-A-X, ginseng,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.360]   has been shown to decrease some symptoms
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:37.080]   associated with menopause, mostly related to libido,
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.240]   although the other effects were unreliable.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.720]   Other things like maca,
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.780]   which is known to increase dopamine actually,
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:45.400]   had minor effects,
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.000]   things like, the names here are a little hard to pronounce,
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.980]   so forgive me, things like Valeriana officionalis
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:55.820]   has shown that there can be some improvement
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:57.440]   in the hot flash symptoms
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.360]   and some of the insomnia associated with that,
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.200]   so that might be worth exploring,
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.720]   again, discuss with your doctor,
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.980]   but these were both 100 subject plus,
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:09.400]   age 45 to 64 individuals,
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.520]   double-blind placebo-controlled studies
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.640]   that showed significant but modest effects.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.640]   There was one substance in the gallery of the compounds
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.840]   that was looked at
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.480]   that turns out to be particularly interesting,
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.560]   and this one is also particularly difficult to pronounce,
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:32.000]   and it's Puraria mirifica,
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.780]   so I'm going to spell this out for you.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:38.780]   It's P-U-E-R-A-R-I-A,
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:42.640]   Puraria mirifica,
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.340]   M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A,
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.100]   and there are four studies on this compound
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:53.260]   that show in every case it to be very potent,
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:56.080]   in fact, comparable to estrogen therapy,
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.920]   estrogen replacement therapy,
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.760]   in reducing the symptoms of menopause,
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.240]   so this was pretty striking
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.600]   because when you go through these studies
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   and you look again that they seem to be
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.740]   pretty well-controlled as far as I could tell,
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:11.580]   and they explored a pretty wide subject pool,
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:16.140]   and it seems that every single one of these studies,
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:21.140]   when looking side-by-side at Puraria mirifica,
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.840]   which is also called,
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.120]   now this is really hard to pronounce,
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.360]   quaocuracao,
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:30.360]   I guess that's the name that they use in various countries,
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.920]   that it was comparable to estrogen replacement therapy,
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.900]   so I mention this because a lot of people contacted me
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.080]   and said, "What about the insomnia in menopause?
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.120]   "What about the headaches in menopause?"
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.600]   Now, I'm not suggesting you run out
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.340]   and immediately start taking any of these compounds.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.180]   Please talk to your doctor.
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.640]   Any hormone-related compound is a serious consideration
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.160]   because of the relationship to breast cancers,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.420]   but just in general, these compounds are,
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.760]   estrogen and testosterone are exceedingly powerful
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.200]   in terms of controlling our mental and physical states,
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.520]   and so you want to approach them with caution,
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.400]   but I thought that that one in particular was interesting
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.640]   and for which there are quite a few PubMed-documented,
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.320]   peer-reviewed studies in quality journals.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.520]   Okay, so now let's talk about
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.320]   the role of specific compounds,
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.840]   some of which, many of which,
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.040]   can be taken in supplementation form
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.520]   or extracted from diet and nutrition
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.600]   in order to optimize sex steroid hormones,
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.640]   and again, I just want to emphasize
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.680]   that I'm not suggesting anyone take anything
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.000]   or stop taking anything.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.040]   This is purely for informational purposes,
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.440]   but some of the data on these
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.220]   is quite striking and impressive.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.120]   It's very clear that certain collections of nutrients
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.400]   are useful for promoting testosterone
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.560]   and estrogen production in their proper ratios,
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.880]   and those things are what I would call
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.780]   the sort of usual suspects.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:56.600]   Vitamin D, which is important
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.760]   for so many biological functions,
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.480]   including endocrine functions,
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.000]   zinc, magnesium, et cetera,
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.320]   and if you want to look into this more deeply
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.600]   and you want to understand exactly
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.240]   what the negative effects are of not having sufficient zinc,
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.320]   magnesium, and what those levels might actually be,
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.680]   there's a paper that's available.
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.560]   You can go on PubMed.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.000]   I can't pronounce this last name.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.200]   It looks to me like Wrozosek,
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.060]   but it's W-R-Z-O-S-E-K.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.820]   I hope I didn't butcher that too badly.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:30.440]   Wrozosek et al., 2020,
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.040]   in "Endocrinology and Metabolism Review."
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.940]   So there's a recent paper in a good peer-reviewed journal.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.120]   It talks mainly about how
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.480]   the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.880]   and the sex steroid hormones are negatively impacted
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.400]   by deficiencies in magnesium,
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.080]   deficiencies in vitamin D, and deficiencies in zinc.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.280]   However, that doesn't point to the levels
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.580]   that one should take in order to optimize.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.760]   So it doesn't say take X amount of zinc
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.180]   or X amount of magnesium or X amount of vitamin D.
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.920]   For that information,
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.800]   because it's so context-dependent
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.200]   and individual-dependent,
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.460]   I highly recommend you go to examine.com.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.660]   You can put in zinc or magnesium or vitamin D,
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:14.060]   and they will give you ranges of dosages
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.880]   that are supported by specific studies.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.780]   Again, that information is completely free to you,
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:22.100]   and it's very useful in figuring that out.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.880]   I personally have supplemented
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.880]   with zinc, magnesium, and vitamin D for years,
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.360]   but many other people do that as well.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.660]   And the question is always how much?
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.220]   And that's why I'm a proponent of getting blood work done,
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:33.440]   because that's how you know whether or not
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.920]   your androgen levels, as well as things
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.240]   like vitamin D levels, et cetera, are sufficiently high.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.760]   So the takeaway from these studies,
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.260]   looking at what deficiencies cause
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.820]   in terms of deficits in testosterone and estrogen,
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:47.700]   really point in the direction of,
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:50.580]   make sure you're getting adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3,
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:53.360]   unless you want these steroid hormone levels
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.260]   to be reduced for whatever reason.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.680]   One of the things that's been shown time and time again
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.920]   to have very negative effects on sex steroid hormones,
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.360]   testosterone mainly in men, estrogen mainly in women,
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.520]   is opioids.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:10.480]   There's this whole issue, of course, of the opioid epidemic.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.920]   It's deserving of an entire episode
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:13.580]   where you're going to talk about that
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.880]   with experts in addiction
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.160]   and people that treat pain and so forth.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.500]   But the opioids dramatically reduce levels
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.480]   of testosterone and estrogen,
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:29.500]   and they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.780]   on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons,
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:33.320]   these neurons within the hypothalamus
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.960]   that communicate to the pituitary.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.240]   And in fact, people that take large amounts of opioids
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.440]   or even take low levels of opioids for long periods of time
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.000]   will develop all sorts of endocrine syndromes.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.860]   That's been shown over and over again.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.720]   Gynecomastia or male breast development in males,
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.120]   disruptions to the ovary in females,
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.660]   it's really a quite terrible situation.
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:58.160]   So excessive opioids are very problematic
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.540]   for sex steroid hormones.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:02.020]   I don't think anyone will have any trouble
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.140]   finding any literature on that.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:04.100]   You can just go into PubMed,
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:09.060]   you can put opioids, testosterone or opioids, estrogen,
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.840]   but the major effect is actually way up in the hypothalamus
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.000]   to shut down the production of GnRH,
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.760]   the very hormone that stimulates
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.960]   testosterone and estrogen release.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.480]   Now there's an entire industry devoted to supplements
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.880]   and various things that people can take
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.220]   to increase testosterone,
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:27.580]   some of which have scientific data to support them,
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.140]   some of which do not,
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.600]   and some of which have anecdotal support
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.300]   and some of which do not.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:35.020]   This ranges so broadly.
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:38.760]   I mean, things like the material off deer antlers,
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.340]   which is high in supposedly IGF-1,
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.740]   which is in the growth hormone pathway,
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:48.640]   all the way to actual consumption of bull testes.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.160]   You can go on Amazon right now,
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.000]   I certainly don't suggest that you do this,
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.500]   and you can actually buy ground up testes from cows.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.420]   And you can consume those.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:01.260]   Now, a lot of that's going to be broken down in the gut.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.900]   I'm certainly not suggesting you do that,
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.080]   but just to point out, this is a huge and vast literature,
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.040]   and it actually dates back hundreds of years,
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.260]   even though testosterone wasn't discovered that long ago
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.580]   as a specific hormone molecule
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.020]   and characterized and then resynthesized,
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.100]   it has a huge industry
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:22.400]   because of the powerful effects that it has.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.760]   Likewise with estrogen,
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.540]   the development of the birth control pill
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:28.140]   was only made possible by understanding the structure
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:29.980]   of estrogen and estradiol,
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.660]   and we're going to talk all about birth control
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:35.020]   and how it works and its influence on various other pathways
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.460]   in a future episode.
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.780]   But there are these supplement compounds
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.800]   that are supported by the scientific literature
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.380]   in terms of their ability to adjust androgens,
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:48.340]   things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.940]   One of the ones that has really good evidence for it
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.000]   is creatine.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.900]   It's very clear that something about creatine,
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:58.520]   although the mechanism isn't exactly clear,
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.300]   either increases 5-alpha reductase
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.460]   or makes the testosterone molecule more susceptible
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.220]   to certain enzymatic reactions
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:09.300]   that leads to increases in DHT.
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.220]   DHT, dihydrotestosterone, as I mentioned,
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.660]   the previous episode has this dramatic role
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:17.700]   in creating a kind of masculinization
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:19.100]   of the brain prenatally.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:22.640]   It also defines the primary sex characteristic
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.540]   of the growth of the penis, et cetera,
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:29.160]   and beyond infancy and early childhood and later in life,
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.860]   it has powerful effects in creating balding
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.020]   and beard growth, et cetera,
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.740]   and it has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.180]   than does testosterone.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:42.040]   So creatine can increase DHT,
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.020]   which means that if you take creatine
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.500]   and you're very DHT susceptible,
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.660]   then you might experience some hair loss.
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:50.820]   This has been heavily debated.
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:52.260]   Does creatine cause baldness?
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:53.100]   It's going to depend.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.560]   It's going to depend on how much 5-alpha reductase you have
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:58.020]   and how prone to hair loss you are.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.840]   Some people can take creatine without any problem
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.680]   in terms of hair loss.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:02.700]   Some people cannot.
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:05.080]   They start losing their hair to levels
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.960]   that at least for them aren't comfortable.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.520]   There are a few other things that can increase testosterone,
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:13.780]   and it has to do with the way that testosterone exists
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:16.040]   in its free and its bound form.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.840]   So testosterone, the molecule is kind of total testosterone.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:21.840]   That's usually what's measured.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.160]   This is the kind of levels
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.260]   that are typically thrown around
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:27.600]   of anywhere from 300 to 900 being the kind of natural range,
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.020]   and then super physiological getting up into 1200, 1600 range.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:36.400]   But testosterone isn't just roaming around free in the blood,
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.960]   at least most of it isn't.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.520]   Most of it is bound to either sex hormone-binding globulin,
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.480]   SHBG, or to albumin.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.440]   They're needed as transporters to get testosterone
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.920]   into cells so that testosterone can have its effects
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.280]   on gene expression as well as other pathways
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.620]   within the cells.
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:58.400]   So people talk about that the level of free testosterone
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.540]   is really what's important,
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:01.900]   and that you want to optimize free testosterone.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.800]   That's a little bit of a tricky statement.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.520]   That's kind of like, it's true,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.560]   and yet it's not really reflective
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.800]   of a thorough understanding
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.400]   of how these binding globulins work.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.040]   Remember, these binding globulins aren't there
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.200]   to soak up all your testosterone just to make it hard
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.880]   for you to free up testosterone and make gains in the gym
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.160]   or whatever it is, or have increases in libido.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.440]   They're there to actually transport testosterone
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.000]   to specific tissues, to shuttle them to specific tissues,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   and to set the rate of bound and unbound testosterone
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.520]   so that it's not all unbound at once.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.280]   And it's always interesting to look in the literature
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.940]   and see how everyone wants to free up their testosterone
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.780]   so that it can work.
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:46.840]   But sex hormone-binding globulin can bind up
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.360]   too much testosterone to the point
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.360]   where it's having negative effects on libido
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:53.300]   or on muscle growth and fat loss and things of that sort.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.160]   This is true in males and females.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.520]   Or it can be doing exactly what it's supposed to do,
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.320]   which is shuttling testosterone to the proper tissues
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.880]   and organs where it has all these effects,
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.280]   including the brain.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:09.280]   So there are supplements, in particular, Tonga Ali,
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.520]   which has this other name.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.440]   It's something I've called Tonga Ali.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.560]   Sometimes it's called, and forgive me,
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:20.560]   that it's hard to pronounce, but Uricoma longifolia jack.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.760]   They always seem to have these names
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.120]   that kind of allude to androgenic features.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.280]   Like, I don't know why longifolia jack.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.240]   I don't know.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.400]   I think it's kind of obvious
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.000]   why that sounds sort of androgenic.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.600]   This has been shown in several studies,
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.160]   and you can find these on examine.com
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.420]   or you can go to PubMed if you like.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.260]   I've looked at these.
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:43.780]   That it does seem to have some pro-fertility,
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:48.780]   pro-free testosterone and subtle aphrodisiac effects.
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:52.560]   It does also seem to be a slight anti-estrogen.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.420]   So the reports of this are people take this anywhere
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.440]   from 400 to 800 milligrams a day.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:42:59.880]   Again, I'm not suggesting you do that,
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.260]   but that's kind of what's out there.
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:03.860]   And there is some decent scientific literature
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:05.680]   to support the fact that it liberates
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.800]   some of the bound testosterone
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:10.540]   and allows more free testosterone to be available.
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.880]   Some of the reported quote-unquote side effects
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.880]   are things like excessive alertness and insomnia
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.660]   if it's taken too late in the day and so forth.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.820]   But I encourage you to explore that further
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.580]   if increasing free testosterone
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:25.440]   is something that you're interested in doing.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.580]   examine.com includes a lot of other things
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.920]   that can increase testosterone.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.260]   One of the things that's been purported
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.920]   to free up testosterone in the blood
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.820]   are things like nettles, stinging nettles.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:40.880]   Although I should point out
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.480]   that the literature points to stinging nettle
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.120]   also having some fairly potent effects
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.280]   on the prostate and on the liver.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.040]   And so it might be a tricky molecule,
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.280]   maybe not an attractive one for people to take.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.440]   So we talked about creatine, we talked about Tonga Ali.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:57.360]   It's clear that boron, which is really interesting,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.200]   believe it or not, I think boron comes from,
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.440]   I think these were like meteors that landed on earth
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.880]   that now they extract boron.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.400]   It's one of these crazy stories that when you look at it,
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.680]   you go, how could that possibly be?
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:11.020]   But there's actually, that's how it works.
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.760]   That boron, there's some scientific support
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.480]   for it freeing up more testosterone.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.720]   And again, freeing up testosterone
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.280]   may be exactly what you want.
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:21.140]   I just don't think that we should demonize
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:23.860]   these carrier proteins like albumin and SHBG.
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:26.640]   In fact, albumin is very important for testosterone
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.280]   to be able to make it into the brain
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.420]   to have some of the proandrogenic effects
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.600]   on the cognitive effects of testosterone.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.200]   Because in both males and females,
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.140]   testosterone can shift these behaviors
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:43.140]   like mate seeking, reductions in anxiety and so forth
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.760]   that we talked about before,
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.200]   only by making it into the brain.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.460]   And there is this thing called the blood brain barrier,
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:51.840]   which is fascinating and deserving of an entire episode also.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:54.840]   And getting molecules across the blood brain barrier,
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.720]   even if they're sex steroid hormones,
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.400]   which are lipophilic and can pass through cell membranes,
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.800]   requires carriers.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.600]   And those carriers often are bound to or include albumin.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.600]   And so it's not the goal to free up all your testosterone,
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.140]   but getting free testosterone into a range
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.580]   that works for your particular goals and needs
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.180]   is an attractive one.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.700]   And that's why we're discussing these particular tools.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.660]   The amounts of boron that people take,
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:24.300]   and you can find this again on PubMed or Examine,
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.400]   but people take a couple of grams of it a day.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.120]   I'm not aware of any specific side effects,
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.240]   but you always, always, always want to examine
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.960]   for the particular side effects.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.580]   And people with different backgrounds and conditions,
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.100]   as we talked about for menopause and estrogen,
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.100]   have to be careful,
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.900]   because when you're starting to modulate hormones,
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:44.020]   you're starting to modulate not just the tissues
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:46.900]   that thrive on binding of those hormones,
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:51.220]   but remember, the reason why there's so much breast cancer,
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.340]   and there's a reason why there's so much testicular cancer
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:57.220]   is that any tissue that undergoes rapid reproduction
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:58.240]   of particular cells,
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.660]   so there's a lot of reproduction of cells
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:01.900]   and shedding of uterine lining
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:04.540]   and the reproduction of cells and eggs in the ovary,
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:06.260]   and in the testes, there's the production
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:09.220]   of Leydig and Sertoli cells,
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:12.660]   and there's this kind of ongoing production of sperm.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:15.460]   That's why those tissues are particularly vulnerable
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:16.640]   to the development of cancers,
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.860]   and many of those cancers are androgen-sensitive.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:21.240]   That's why one of the major treatments
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.740]   for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:26.740]   is to give antiandrogenic drugs, okay?
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:29.780]   It's not just to shut down all things
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:33.020]   related to being androgenized.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.720]   It's really about trying to prevent testosterone
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.660]   from encouraging growth of tumors.
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:41.540]   So I want to really emphasize the caution there,
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:44.900]   because it is easy when thinking about optimizing estrogen
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.480]   and testosterone to just think, oh, more is better.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.940]   More is definitely not better,
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.740]   and it's not just because they can aromatize
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.420]   or convert into other things.
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.920]   It's because cancers or any tissue
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:57.780]   that has a lot of turnover of cells
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.340]   is going to thrive on androgen,
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:01.580]   anything that promotes growth.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.520]   It's going to thrive on estrogen.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.740]   Remember, brain tissue doesn't turn over that much.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:07.660]   There isn't really much production of new neurons.
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:09.580]   Brain cancers happen, but they're kind of rare,
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.900]   and when they do happen, they tend to be glial cells,
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:13.520]   which have a lot of proliferation.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.940]   Glial cells can proliferate.
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.060]   Adult neurons don't create more of themselves.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.420]   They don't create more neurons in general,
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.860]   except in a few places in the brain and body.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:26.860]   So any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers,
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:31.260]   and those tissues thrive on androgens and estrogens
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:32.640]   to create more tumors.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.060]   So you have to be careful
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:35.580]   anytime you're modulating hormones,
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:38.420]   especially androgens and estrogens.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:40.020]   And in my scouring of the literature
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.820]   and looking at kind of what's out there
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:43.860]   and what people are talking about,
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:46.700]   and I also mean in the scientific literature,
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:49.860]   one of the things that is new to me anyway,
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:54.380]   probably not new to a lot of the gym rats out there,
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:56.460]   or the people that spend a lot of time on YouTube videos
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.740]   talking about androgens are these,
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.540]   forgive me for butchering the name again,
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:03.620]   are these ectosteroids.
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:08.360]   So ectosteroids are molecules
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:12.100]   that come from things like spinach, believe it or not,
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:16.420]   that have a lot of similarity to the cholesterol molecule.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.220]   The one that's being discussed a lot out there right now
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.860]   is something called turkisterone.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:23.520]   I wish I knew why it was called turkisterone.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.020]   Someone tell me why it's called turkisterone.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:27.380]   Does it have anything to do with turkeys?
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:30.300]   I don't know why it's called turkisterone.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.300]   Perhaps someone will know.
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:35.020]   In any case, these ectosteroids
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:36.820]   are similar enough to cholesterol.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:39.300]   Remember cholesterol is the precursor
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:42.060]   to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen.
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:45.800]   And it appears that some of these ectosteroids
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.060]   do have bioavailability
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.980]   or their metabolites are bioavailable.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.620]   And this was something that for many years
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.980]   people talked about whether or not
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:56.740]   insect hormones or hormones from other species
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:58.940]   could actually be used by humans
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.320]   or whether or not it would have any effect at all.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.480]   And it's pretty clear based on a study
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.400]   that I was able to find.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.980]   There's a paper that came out in 2019.
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:11.100]   It's a comparative study in the archives of toxicology.
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:15.900]   This is Isenman et al., I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al.,
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.820]   that talks about the ectosteroids
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.960]   and was given in conjunction with strength training
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:22.880]   or no strength training.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.300]   This is a 10-week intervention.
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:27.540]   And their conclusion is that these ectosteroids
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:31.360]   had a fairly significant, above placebo controls,
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.940]   increases in muscle mass, strength, hypertrophy effects,
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:37.020]   all the sorts of things that one would expect
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:39.540]   with increases in androgen.
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:43.540]   Their conclusion of this study is not my conclusion,
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:45.300]   although I may or may not agree with them.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.540]   This isn't about my opinions.
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:47.480]   It's just, I want to be clear.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.940]   These are their words, not mine.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:52.940]   But they say that in their words,
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:55.460]   our results strongly suggest the inclusion of ectosteroid
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:56.920]   in the list of prohibitive substances.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.580]   So they're saying these things are so powerful
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.240]   that they should be on the list of banned substances,
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.340]   which might be upsetting to some,
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:07.400]   or some of you might be thinking, well, who cares?
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:12.400]   The whole issue of augmenting hormones in sport
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.600]   is a very interesting issue.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.900]   In fact, if you just want a little anecdote about that,
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:18.860]   I can't reveal names here, of course,
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.860]   but what I learned recently was very surprising to me,
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:24.860]   which is that many athletes in pro sports
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.020]   are taking testosterone,
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:30.540]   and they are able to do that legally,
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.500]   not just because it's available by prescription,
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:33.860]   but they are allowed to do that
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.860]   under the rules of their sport,
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:38.860]   in the fine print that no one, including me, had ever seen,
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:41.140]   if they've had an injury.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.800]   So if athletes are injured,
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:45.660]   then it opens up the door for certain forms
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.860]   of testosterone augmentation
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:50.460]   and other types of augmentations
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:52.740]   that are not available to them if they're not injured,
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:54.140]   which always makes me wonder now
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:55.180]   when I see them getting injured,
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.660]   whether or not that's an attempt to get some of the support,
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.060]   because there's absolutely no question
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:03.980]   that estrogens and testosterone modulate gene expression,
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:06.380]   modulate strength, modulate the way the brain works,
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:09.660]   modulates our relationship to effort and anxiety, et cetera.
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.820]   And while we're talking about supplementation,
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:15.100]   the effects of supplementation, I would say,
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.100]   in some individuals can be quite dramatic,
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:22.100]   but they're always, always, always, except in extreme cases,
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:27.220]   going to be far subtler, excuse me, far more subtle,
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:29.900]   to use the proper English,
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:32.080]   far more subtle than would be, for instance,
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:36.780]   just injecting testosterone or injecting estrogen, et cetera.
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:40.020]   So I think we should just be honest and upfront about that.
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:44.980]   So thus far, in terms of talking about optimizing hormones
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:47.420]   and in the discussion of supplementation,
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:49.800]   I haven't really talked about things
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:51.720]   that actually affect the brain directly,
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.780]   that increase the pituitary output and things of that sort.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.880]   We've mainly been talking about things
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.700]   that free up testosterone or that increase estrogen
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:00.580]   at the level of the periphery.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.980]   But if you remember way back to the beginning of this episode
[01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:05.120]   hormones are made in different locations in the body,
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.840]   and there are hormones that promote the release
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.380]   and the production of hormones
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:10.460]   from other tissues in the body.
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:14.140]   And one of the main hormones for that is luteinizing hormone.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.340]   Luteinizing hormone, again, comes from the pituitary,
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:18.820]   circulates, and either goes to the ovary
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:23.820]   to promote various aspects of egg maturation,
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:26.660]   as well as production of estrogen,
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:29.100]   and to the testes to promote
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:31.700]   testosterone and sperm production.
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:35.380]   And the prescription version
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:39.100]   of increasing luteinizing hormone is something called HCG,
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:40.740]   or human chorionic gonadotropin,
[01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.900]   which has been synthesized and is now available
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:44.460]   as a prescription drug.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:48.880]   It's taken in various contexts for increasing fertility,
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.020]   both by males and by females.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:54.680]   It can increase for all the reasons that now make sense.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.020]   It can increase sperm production.
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:59.020]   It can produce ovulation frequency.
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:02.180]   It can produce the number of eggs even that are deployed
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:03.620]   in a given ovulation,
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.580]   although that's not always a good thing.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:10.020]   It basically is pro-fertility, pro-testosterone,
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:12.940]   pro-estrogen, depending on your background.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:17.940]   And what's interesting is HCG was initially synthesized,
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:22.220]   collected and synthesized from pregnant women's urine.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:27.020]   And believe it or not, before it was synthetically made
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.720]   and sold as a prescription drug,
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:33.560]   there was actually a black market for pregnant women's urine
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.260]   where people would buy the urine.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:37.840]   I don't know, I'm guessing that they probably
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:40.580]   just consumed it, which is weird.
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:44.200]   But in any case, human chorionic gonadotropin
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.320]   is now available as a prescription drug.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:48.560]   And it's one of the things that many people use
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.160]   to increase testosterone or estrogen
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.800]   for increasing fertility.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.740]   Some cases I think it's used to increase sports performance
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:59.120]   or when people have shut down their gonads
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.960]   for whatever reason because of excessive hormone therapies,
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.980]   or they have some sort of,
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:07.600]   sometimes they're actually lesions to the pituitary,
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.220]   sometimes people will have a tumor in the pituitary.
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.420]   It's actually not common, but among brain tumors
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:15.900]   and neural tumors, it's one of the more common ones.
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:18.340]   And then you get deficiencies in LH and FSH,
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:20.920]   and so people will take HCG to stimulate the gonads.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:21.900]   So there are a variety of reasons
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:23.820]   why these drugs were created.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.400]   But there are certain supplements, not many,
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.980]   that apparently can increase luteinizing hormone
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:31.980]   and thereby can increase testosterone and estrogen.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:34.540]   And one of the more well-documented ones
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:39.120]   is phadogia agrestis, that's F-A-D-O-G-I-A,
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:42.900]   separate word A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:45.920]   which at least according to the literature
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.040]   that I was able to find
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.080]   can increase levels of luteinizing hormone
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:52.440]   and thereby levels of testosterone or levels of estrogen.
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.920]   And again, if an individual were to take phadogia agrestis,
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:57.000]   what they would probably find
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.960]   is that testosterone and estrogen would increase
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.320]   in anyone of any chromosomal or gonadal background.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:05.040]   But remember, it's the ratio of both.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.420]   So both, if someone has low estrogen, high testosterone,
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:10.260]   let's say they have testes just by way of example,
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:13.320]   then both of those would be expected to increase.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.820]   And if someone has high estrogen and low testosterone,
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:17.880]   and let's just say has ovaries,
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:19.540]   then both of those would increase
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:21.960]   by taking phadogia agrestis.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.260]   The side effect profile of phadogia agrestis
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:27.540]   hasn't really been documented, so it's a little unclear.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.340]   I just want to emphasize
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:32.340]   that anytime someone's going to start taking supplements
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:34.900]   that, or modifying sex steroid hormones,
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:38.740]   getting blood work done is extremely important
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:39.660]   for safety reasons,
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:42.100]   and also just to know whether or not things are working.
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.860]   And because all of these things
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.840]   are subject to negative feedback,
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.700]   talked about this previously, previous episode,
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:51.560]   but if testosterone goes high or too high,
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:54.320]   it can feed back and shut down luteinizing hormone,
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.200]   which will then shut down further testosterone production.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.580]   Likewise, if estrogens are going too high
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:02.160]   or they're going too high at various phases of the cycle,
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:05.460]   that can start to throw off various other hormones,
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:09.900]   including FSH, progesterone, LH.
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.140]   The menstrual cycle itself
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:13.820]   is a just absolutely exquisite balance
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:17.500]   of feedback of luteinizing hormone kept low and constant,
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.800]   at least for the first 14 days of the cycle.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.380]   Then mid-cycle, there's a peak,
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:24.180]   and that's typically when ovulation occurs.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:25.940]   That's why pregnancy is most likely
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:28.140]   during the middle of the 28-day cycle.
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:33.120]   FSH kind of goes up and then down across the first 14 days.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.160]   So taking anything or really modifying one's estrogens
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.380]   or testosterone on that background of the menstrual cycle
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:42.800]   is really going to disrupt the way those things interact,
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:45.100]   and it's just such an exquisite feedback loop.
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:48.200]   So I'm not saying don't do that,
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.840]   but you definitely want to be aware of what you're doing,
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.840]   and blood draws are one way to do that.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.780]   Monitoring cycles for ovulating females
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:56.700]   is another way to do that.
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:58.900]   And in males, having a good window
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:00.620]   into what's going on with testosterone,
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:05.620]   DHT, aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera, is just vital.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:09.740]   And it's really part and parcel with the practice
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:12.340]   of thinking about optimizing these incredible things
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.940]   that we call sex steroid hormones,
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:16.340]   estrogen, and testosterone, and their derivatives.
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.580]   The list of supplements and molecules
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:22.220]   that can adjust estrogen and testosterone is vast,
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:23.820]   and I only touched on a few of these.
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:26.000]   I really tried to emphasize the ones
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.280]   for which there are human studies,
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.640]   or that have mostly human studies,
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.300]   or maybe even just one human study.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:36.680]   There are other things out there
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.140]   for which there are scientific data,
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.740]   things like bulbine natalensis,
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:42.940]   which definitely has support for increasing testosterone,
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:45.180]   but all the studies were in rats.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.780]   I think there is some evidence in humans,
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.660]   but the evidence mainly comes in the form
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:50.660]   of what we call sponsored research,
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:52.780]   so companies paying for research,
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.860]   which is different than independent research
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:58.340]   by people who are not biased in terms of the outcome.
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:00.060]   And the reason I didn't throw out things
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:04.080]   like bulbine natalensis is they seem to have liver toxicity
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:08.220]   similar to high levels of anabolic exogenous steroids.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:10.560]   There's some problems associated with them
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.720]   that make them important to think about
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.360]   if you're curious about this area and the endocrinology,
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:21.380]   but also somewhat precarious.
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:23.720]   And that's one category,
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.080]   so stuff that doesn't have a lot of evidence in humans
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.580]   might actually be dangerous.
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:32.760]   The other category of things that has been shown to improve
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:35.060]   or levels of, or increase, I should say,
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.980]   I don't want to say improve 'cause it's up to you
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:37.860]   whether or not you want to increase
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:39.660]   or decrease estrogen and testosterone,
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.800]   that's highly individual, how could I know,
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:43.760]   are the things that are kind of housekeeping
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.800]   for production of estrogen and testosterone,
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:50.080]   things like magnesium, things like D3, things like zinc.
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:53.080]   Those are the things that are going to create
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.200]   an overall milieu of opportunity
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:58.440]   to produce normal endogenous levels
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:01.720]   rather than increasing endogenous levels further.
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:04.220]   And so I really want to highlight that there's a difference
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.260]   between taking something to create a kind of backdrop
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.400]   of general support and taking something
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.740]   that's going to create a big inflection
[01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:14.040]   in the levels of a given hormone.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:17.320]   So once again, we covered a tremendous amount of information.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:20.660]   We covered some basic science of hormones and pheromones,
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:23.340]   estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:26.400]   We talked about supplementation and behaviors,
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.220]   competition and parenting,
[01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:30.280]   and how all these things interact.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.560]   And I hope that you'll come away from this
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.600]   with a deeper mechanistic understanding
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.480]   of how the brain and body are interacting
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:41.120]   to control the output and the ways
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:42.720]   in which these incredible things
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:45.920]   that we call sex steroid hormones work and influence us.
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.600]   I hope you'll also come away with some ideas
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:51.140]   of things that you can do in particular behavioral practices
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:54.100]   that can improve sleep and your relationship to light,
[01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:57.800]   et cetera, because those things really set the foundation,
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:01.560]   not just for healthy steroid hormone output,
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:04.660]   but for all sorts of health effects
[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:07.980]   and for both the psychology and the biology
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:09.940]   of your nervous system.
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.980]   So I'm sure there'll be many questions.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:14.660]   There are many things that I couldn't get to today.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.000]   I do try and limit these episodes to about 90 minutes,
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.800]   which is the optimal ultradian cycle for learning.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:21.760]   It's a lot of information,
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.360]   but we've timestamped everything for you.
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:26.400]   So feel free to look over it in parts
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:29.500]   or circle back where you might want deeper understanding.
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:32.640]   And please put your questions in the comment section below.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.320]   Please put suggestions for future episodes
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.920]   and things that relate to hormones
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.560]   in the comment section below.
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:40.260]   We do look at those and we do use them
[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:43.540]   to inform the content for subsequent episodes.

[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.340]   mentioned at the beginning of each episode.
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:15.180]   And we also have a Patreon.
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:18.820]   That's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:21.000]   At the Patreon, you can help support the podcast
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.040]   at any level that you like.
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.820]   As well, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:29.260]   which is a supplement company.
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:30.540]   The reason we partnered with Thorne
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.580]   is that they have the highest levels of stringency
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:35.580]   in terms of the quality of the supplements that they make
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:37.760]   and the quantity of the individual ingredients,
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:40.100]   something that's not always the case
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.580]   with various supplement companies,
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:43.620]   but Thorne is exquisitely good
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.420]   about the stringency of their products.
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.860]   They partner with the Mayo Clinic
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:48.840]   and all the major sports teams.
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:50.020]   If you want to check out Thorne
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.600]   and see the supplements that I take,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.140]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:58.320]   And if you do that, you can see the supplements I take,
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.940]   but as well, it'll allow you to get 20% off
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:01.940]   any of those supplements
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:04.620]   or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:07.860]   That's thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:11.380]   .com/u/huberman
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:14.140]   to get 20% off any Thorne supplements.
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.500]   In closing, I hope you'll leave today's episode
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:19.240]   with a much richer understanding of the mechanisms
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:21.320]   that control the endocrine and nervous system
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:24.020]   in the context of estrogen and testosterone,
[02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:25.980]   as well as take away various tools
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:28.100]   that you might choose to apply.
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:31.260]   And next week, we'll be back with another episode
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.620]   about the role of hormones
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:35.820]   and its important interactions with the nervous system,
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:38.280]   and that will, of course, include both mechanisms
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.700]   and tools as well.
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:42.500]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
