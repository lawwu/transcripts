[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.240]   Remember our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.180]   for any questions.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.600]   Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Innovator ETFs.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.840]   Innovator rolls out these defined outcome ETFs.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.960]   A lot of the time, we've talked about
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.120]   how they have downside protection.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.320]   A lot of people want that, especially older investors.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.760]   A lot of the questions we get from our audience
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.460]   deals with, I want more upside.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.240]   I'm young, I have a high risk tolerance.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.960]   So Innovator just released this new ETF,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.480]   the Uncapped Accelerated US Equity ETF, XUSP.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   Here's how it works.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.040]   One-to-one downside with the market.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.220]   There's no downside protection here,
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.160]   but some people who have a long time horizon don't need it,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.200]   but it holds four quarterly upside options on the S&P
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.160]   that are staggered throughout the year
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.320]   to provide a little diversification.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.460]   You see, these are the current accelerated returns, right?
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.920]   And there's no upside on these caps.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.800]   So no downside protection, but no upside cap either.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.120]   So what's the catch here?
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120]   'Cause you can see these are the percentages
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.400]   of the S&P that you get.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.160]   The only big caveat here is that the first 5%
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.320]   of your upside is gone,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.760]   'cause that's the cost of the options, right?
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.200]   You have to pay something.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.440]   So up to 5%.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   The thing is, most of the time when the stock market is up,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.800]   it's up a lot.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.400]   So Duncan, one of my stats from this week was,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.920]   going back the last 100 years or so,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.240]   the US stock market is up more than 20% in a year,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.920]   calendar year, more often than it's down in a given year.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.760]   So big returns.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.580]   So that's the thing.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.680]   You have to eat that 5%.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.440]   That's basically your cost of the options.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.000]   But then you get this uncapped upside
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.720]   when the stock market does really well,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.560]   you're gonna do better.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.380]   Pretty interesting.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.120]   If you wanna learn more, innovatoretfs.com.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.520]   All right, Duncan, this week we had a little offsite
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.160]   and someone in the firm asked me,
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.360]   what's the most asked question we get?
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   There are some usuals like,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.240]   what to do with a lump sum is a big one.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   Should I invest in levered ETFs?
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.480]   How much should I be saving?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.000]   How does Ben have such a wonderful Hawaiian shirt collection?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.560]   These types of things, right?
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.480]   But if there's a single subject we get the most,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.080]   it's about taxes.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.240]   And last week we had Bill Arzaronian on and I asked him,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.920]   why do you think we get so many questions about taxes?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   'Cause I mean, it's gotta be 50% of the questions.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380]   And he said, probably rightly or wrongly,
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.840]   most people assume, I'm a good investor.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.660]   I can handle this.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.500]   I follow the markets.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.320]   I know what to invest in.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.300]   I got that part taken care of.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.320]   But a lot of people really are worried
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.400]   about making a mistake with taxes, right?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.440]   And I think a lot of times it's a mistake of omission.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.520]   The tax code is so confusing and hard to understand
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   that people assume that there's maybe a break
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.440]   that they're missing out on,
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.320]   or there's something they're doing
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.440]   that they could be doing.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.360]   And so the other thing is people truly hate paying taxes,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.400]   but we do get a ton and ton of tax questions
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.600]   and it makes a lot of sense
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   that people just don't wanna screw things up.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.560]   And people just really,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.400]   I think that's something we can all agree on,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.960]   that people hate taxes.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.800]   - Yeah, hate them. - Correct?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.520]   - And it's like such a complicated structure
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   that I think no one really fully understands.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.800]   - And having said that, no tax questions this week.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.640]   - Yeah.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.480]   - We did it.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.320]   We got a lot of other good ones, so let's do it.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.080]   - We saved those for the bills.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.920]   - Okay, there you go.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.760]   All right, let's do one.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.180]   - All right, first up, we have a question from Jamie.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.120]   Kind of a bummer to start.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.480]   You know, yesterday was your birthday.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.320]   I mentioned to you, I was like,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.680]   "Are you sure you wanna start out the day
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.960]   on kind of such a bummer after your birthday?"
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.120]   But yeah, happy belated birthday, by the way.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   - All right, thank you.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.800]   - So first up, we have a question from Jamie.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.560]   Both of my parents have passed away,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.380]   with my father passing a little over a year ago.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.360]   He left us $263,000 in a savings account
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.980]   in my childhood home that was paid off.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.800]   We sold the home for $550,000,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.520]   and I paid off my home and all debt
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.820]   with $201,000 of this money.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.680]   I started way too investing, opening a 403B in 2014,
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.520]   that I make small contributions to.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.120]   The 403B account is at $22,000 now,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.020]   and I have a Roth IRA with $5,000 in it.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.840]   I have $92,000 of savings.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.720]   I'm not sure what I should do with it.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.680]   My wife took a year off to be with our baby boy,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   but is returning to work in September.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.880]   I've never had much money before,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000]   and I feel like I need to hoard it in the bank,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.080]   but I know I'm losing money leaving it there.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.540]   Can you help me figure out what I should do?
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.920]   - Yeah, condolences, obviously.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.380]   - Yeah, sorry for your loss. - Sometimes this is reality,
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.220]   right?
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.280]   It's strange to think about,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   but there's gonna be a lot of this in the coming year.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.240]   So John, do a chart on of this population demographic here.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.760]   There's way more older people than ever before,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.720]   and unfortunately, that means there's gonna be
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.280]   a lot of people dying in the years ahead.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.320]   It's kind of morbid to think about, but it's true.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.960]   There's a lot of old people.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.460]   A lot of baby boomers in the years ahead
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.300]   are gonna be retiring,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.540]   and we're gonna have to take care of them,
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.760]   but also there's gonna be a lot of older people
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.080]   kind of passing away, unfortunately.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.920]   So I think this is more of a psychological question
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.720]   than a finance question, right?
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.480]   This is a huge change in your net worth.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.320]   It's gonna change the way you feel about money,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.400]   the way you think about it.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.240]   The good news is,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.600]   it sounds like you've cleared out some debt payments,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.160]   and you're not just blowing through this inheritance.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.120]   So you're off to a good start.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.040]   You're being thoughtful of it.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.680]   And considering you got a late start for retirement,
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.480]   and your balances are still relatively low,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.240]   especially if you compare them to the value of your house
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.060]   that's now paid off,
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.200]   you have a chance to right the ship here.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.560]   So I think it's totally understandable.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.880]   You have some fears about what to do with it.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.720]   It's a lot of money.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.360]   You don't wanna screw it up.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.840]   Plus, there's probably a lot of emotional baggage
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.640]   tied to this, since this money came from your parents.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.080]   Well, here's the first step that's a no-brainer, I think,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.160]   before we even get to the lump sum.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.400]   You can bump up your retirement contributions in a big way.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.160]   If you paid off your house, your credit card, and your car,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.880]   we're probably talking thousands of dollars a month
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.040]   that you've freed up in cashflow, right?
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.760]   Now, you can take some of that disposable income.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040]   My rule of thumb is,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.720]   you should try to save at least half of every raise.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.080]   And I consider debt repayment,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.680]   when you pay your debt off, that's a raise.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.660]   Student loans get paid off, that's a raise, right?
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.960]   But save at least half of it.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.200]   So that way, you give yourself a little bump
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.340]   in the standard of living,
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.180]   but then you're also saving,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.080]   and you don't see that money hit your checking account ever,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.960]   and it just goes straight to it.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.000]   So figure out how much you're saving each month
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.080]   from those debt payments that are not going out anymore,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.280]   and save at least half of that.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.520]   That's a huge win right there.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.200]   And that's dollar cost averaging into the market,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.680]   so that can maybe, you know,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.440]   assuage your fears a little bit about being worried
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.760]   about what's gonna happen in the market.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.600]   So that should help supercharge things,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.520]   especially since you're slowly averaging into the market,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.200]   and you have some relatively smaller retirement balances.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.240]   Step two is you have that $92,000 in a lump sum.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.720]   Now, here's the thing, you're house rich.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.600]   So you probably could level off
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   your retirement savings a little bit,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.140]   and kind of play catch up a little bit.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.800]   The first thing I think you should do, though,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.020]   carve out a piece of that money,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.840]   whatever it is, a percentage or an amount,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.080]   and enjoy yourself.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.240]   Go on a vacation, go for a really nice meal
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.720]   at your parents' old favorite restaurant.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.000]   Buy something you normally wouldn't do
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.080]   with disposable income.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.800]   Like, treat yourself a little bit, splurge on yourself.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.000]   I'm guessing it'll make your parents happy
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.440]   to know that you took that money
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.040]   and did something enjoyable with it.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.000]   You could also pre-fund some future goals, right?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.760]   Maybe daycare, since your wife is going back to work,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.080]   you have a new baby.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.500]   Maybe it's a future family vacation.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.320]   Maybe it's a 529 plan for your son.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.040]   Maybe you wanna shore up your emergency fund.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.900]   Yeah, some of that money should probably go
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.440]   into your retirement account,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.320]   because you have to make up for some lost time
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.160]   since you started late,
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.440]   and you said that your balances are relatively low.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.160]   So you come up with some sort of allocation,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.640]   emergency fund, 529, family vacation,
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.620]   splurge, and then retirement.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.960]   Break it up how you want,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.980]   and then slowly put it to work.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.460]   You don't have to do it all at once, right?
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.360]   But don't leave it all in the bank either.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.380]   Like, you should do something
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.720]   because you have a chance to sort of right the ship here,
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.280]   and using that lump sum can help.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.920]   But I think the biggest thing really is
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.560]   you paid off those debts, that's good.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.680]   Now take that income that you freed up
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.840]   and increase your savings rate,
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.540]   and then you're helping yourself for the future
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.740]   'cause you're saving more and more each month.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.040]   Thoughts? - Yeah, I feel like,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.400]   for fun, you could even do that grand tour
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.000]   of the whole world, Viking cruise thing.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.840]   I don't know if you've seen that,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.840]   but it's literally, it's like 40 days or something.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.680]   I think you could do that for that.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.760]   - I thought the pandemic kinda canceled cruises, no?
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.600]   - Oh, no. - People are still
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.420]   doing that? (Duncan laughs)
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.000]   - No, I think they're roaring back, but yeah.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.840]   Just kidding, though. - Yeah, try a little bit.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   - I think that would use up the full amount of savings.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.680]   So just kidding, don't do that.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.360]   - Okay, that should've been your honeymoon, Duncan.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.260]   All right, let's do the next one.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.560]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Don.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.360]   I'm in my early 50s with a net worth
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.520]   of around $2 million and a nice salary.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.980]   My expenditures are very low,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.240]   no mortgage or other large outlays.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   My 24-year-old son has a disability,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.220]   but limits his income potential.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.880]   I like working and don't plan on retiring early.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.020]   Does it make sense to think about my investment horizon
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.280]   from my son's perspective rather than mine?
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.040]   In other words, instead of rebalancing
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.560]   into a more conservative portfolio as I age,
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.900]   should I stay invested in riskier assets
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.840]   so that he and his trust may reap the benefits
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.880]   long after I'm gone?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.800]   - He's certainly thinking about this in the right way.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.880]   This is the right way to think about it.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.760]   Like, does your time horizon change?
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.180]   I think everyone has different time horizons and goals.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.720]   And even if retirement is one of the biggest ones
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.040]   for most people, you still have to balance out
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.800]   your short-term needs with your long-term desires
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.400]   to keep up with your standard of living.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.560]   It's one pool of money, so this is essentially
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.240]   a form of mental accounting, but I think it can help
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.560]   to break this up into different buckets.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.680]   I've talked about this before.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.200]   But your glide path might be differently.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.240]   So you're 50 years old with $2 million now, right?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   Let's say you work until you're 65.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.120]   If you save nothing else and just manage
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.720]   to grow your net worth at 5% a year,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.200]   we're talking $4 million by age 65.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.920]   So you're in a pretty good spot.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.320]   But you have to build your son's needs
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.640]   into your financial plan, it sounds like.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.240]   So are you investing the money for when he retires someday?
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.960]   Are you investing the money for when you pass away someday?
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.400]   Is he gonna need some more money to live on?
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.060]   Are his insurance needs being met now?
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.120]   And would that change if and when you do pass away?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.460]   So I think thinking through this
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.040]   can help answer this question.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.600]   And it depends on kind of when you need that money.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.720]   But I think everyone's time horizon risk profile
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.800]   is different depending on their goal.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.600]   So I think you can have different streams
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.760]   in your portfolio that you're using for different goals.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.840]   It's just one big bucket.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.560]   But I think if you break it up like that
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.400]   and you set a pool of capital aside
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.860]   that's gonna be for your son
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.560]   and invest it based on his goals and his time horizon,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.400]   that makes sense.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.700]   Again, it's mental accounting.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.900]   It's a way of bucketing within your one big pool of assets.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.940]   But I think that, yeah, that makes sense
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.600]   that part of that capital is gonna be invested way longer.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.800]   It's just like people who say I have enough money for myself
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.200]   and the next few generations
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.880]   I'm investing for the grandkids.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.720]   Yeah, then you leave that money
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.600]   in the stock market longer probably
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.880]   'cause you have more decades to invest.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.800]   But it depends.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.080]   It always depends on when your son
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.920]   is gonna need that money
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.320]   and when are you gonna need that money.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.480]   - Yeah, it seems like such a kind of freeing idea
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.320]   in a way, right?
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.200]   Because it's, yeah, the time horizon
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.080]   is pretty much limitless
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.200]   instead of constantly being concerned with, yeah.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.040]   - But that can take away some of the worries though
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.080]   'cause that's one of the worries
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.500]   for a lot of people in retirement
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.760]   is I can't have as long a time horizon anymore
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.220]   because I need to spend a lot of this money.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.140]   But yeah, if part of that money,
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.540]   if you can take a certain percentage of it
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.500]   and keep it in the stock market longer for your son,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.460]   yeah, it can be a little freeing
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.840]   so you don't worry about it as much.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.060]   - Right.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.000]   - Let's do another one.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.700]   - Okay, so up next we have,
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.260]   I have a house with the low interest rate of 2.75%
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.900]   that I refinanced a year ago.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.160]   My family has grown, three kids,
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.100]   and it might be time to get a bigger house.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.540]   My problem is that mortgage rates have skyrocketed
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.460]   and now I could probably get a 5.75% rate.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.900]   Is there anything I can do with this low rate asset
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.540]   or am I stuck selling my house at 2.75%
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.780]   and financing at the higher rate?
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.140]   How much would you value that change in rate
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.600]   assuming both houses are $500,000?
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.100]   Is there a way to calculate that?
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.940]   - There is a way to calculate that
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.660]   and I think this is something millions of people
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.660]   may be going through in the years ahead.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.680]   Now I've talked before, it's quite possible
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.700]   rates come back down the next time we go into recession
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.540]   and the Fed lowers rates,
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.360]   that mortgage rates could come down.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.480]   It's also possible that sub-3% mortgages
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.500]   are a thing of the past
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.660]   and that was just this one 18 month window that we had
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.040]   and maybe it's never coming back.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.540]   My wife and I actually went through the same exercise
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.440]   when we had twins.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.980]   We realized immediately
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.620]   that our house was way too small for three kids.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.020]   It just wasn't gonna work.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.820]   And so we actually, side note,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.380]   had our twins in May, I think this was 2017,
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.860]   and we moved into our new house in June.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.500]   So that was a busy month in the household
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.060]   or hectic time in the Carlson household.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.420]   I wish I had better news for this person.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.000]   Unfortunately, you're kind of out of luck
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.500]   when it comes to that mortgage rate.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.460]   Now, right now, here's the thing.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.140]   You're borrowing at a lower rate
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.700]   than the federal government, right?
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.820]   If we look at all the rates,
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.820]   the 12 month T-bill rate is like 3.2%,
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.980]   two year, 3.2%, the five years, 3%,
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.020]   the 10 years, 2.85 and the 30 years, 3.1.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.500]   So your 2.75% mortgage you've refinanced into,
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.460]   you're borrowing at a lower rate
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.380]   than the federal government,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.240]   which is going to be very hard to get rid of.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.960]   So let's assume you have a five,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.940]   you said $5,000 house, right?
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.040]   At a 20% down payment, 2.75% mortgage rate,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.480]   we're talking about like a little over $1,600 a month
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.920]   that you're paying, no taxes or anything on there.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.800]   If we bump that same level up to 5.75%,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.760]   now we're talking about over $2,300.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   So we're talking $700 a month in higher payments.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.300]   What's that, $8,400 a year?
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.380]   It's tough.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.160]   So here's the options as I see them.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.440]   You just suck it up and buy a bigger house.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.240]   It's probably gonna make you happier.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   It stinks, but what are you gonna do?
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.960]   Would you rather stay in the old house and save some money?
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.640]   You can't live in a spreadsheet, right?
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.200]   So, and again, it's possibly gonna be able to refinance
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.380]   in the years ahead as rates come down.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.400]   You could always take some money out of your current home.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.200]   You probably have some good equity in it.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.560]   Renovate your current home.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.960]   I don't know, add another bedroom somewhere.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.440]   Maybe do a Mike Seaver above the garage.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.280]   Is that one too old?
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.300]   Growing pains?
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.140]   Duncan, is that over your head?
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.640]   - Yeah, that was over my head.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.480]   I didn't watch that one.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.300]   - Okay.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.760]   You could look at some other forms of financing.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.420]   I mean, maybe, I was gonna say an adjustable rate mortgage,
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.920]   but I looked at them this morning.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.580]   A five-year arm is 5.7.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.000]   It's higher than the 30-year fixed, which is 5.5 right now.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.580]   So that's out the window.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.040]   Maybe a higher down payment because of your current equity.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.480]   Maybe a 15-year mortgage.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.680]   The problem is all of these options
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.240]   are gonna cost you one way or another.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   So the only thing that matters is,
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   is it worth it to find a new house for your family?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.520]   So these are the kind of problems that are solved
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.360]   qualitatively, not quantitatively, unfortunately.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.200]   And it's gonna be really, really painful
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.900]   to let go of a sub-3% mortgage.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.720]   I can say, there's no way I can sugarcoat that.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.620]   But if you have to move, sometimes you just have to move.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.360]   - Right, yeah.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.920]   This is about more than just the money, right?
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.120]   If it's a growing family, that's kind of--
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.960]   - Unfortunately, and again,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.240]   I think there's gonna be a lot of people
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.960]   that are gonna be making this,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.580]   having this debate in the coming years.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.960]   It's going to be tough.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.040]   Hey, see, someone in the Slack,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.920]   someone in the comments got my Kirk Cameron reference there.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.160]   He lived in the apartment above the garage
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.840]   on growing pains, which was also--
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.280]   - Oh, so yeah, like the Fonz.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.420]   - Yeah, so also growing pains,
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.420]   possibly the greatest intro song of any 1980s show.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.880]   Look it up sometime, Duncan.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.760]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.800]   - Okay, I'll take your word for it.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.260]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Devin.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.280]   And this one starts out with a nice not to brag.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.720]   I'm a high-income earner, married with no kids,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.400]   30 years old and no debt.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.640]   I live in Manhattan and have been considering purchasing
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   a home in New York City.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.240]   My budget is around $1.2 to $1.6 million
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.840]   for a two or three bedroom.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.240]   This breaks down to an $8,000 to $11,000 mortgage
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.000]   plus fees all in for a monthly payment.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.320]   Wow.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.360]   For each of the buildings,
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.840]   we have been evaluating both co-ops and condos.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.100]   The returns, even over the past 10 to 15 years,
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.960]   appear to be absolute dog excrement, benchmark to S&P.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.000]   Broadly speaking, the units were $950,000 to $1 million
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.080]   in 2010 and now sell for $1.3 million.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.440]   The returns on these units make zero sense
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.240]   when you factor in yearly maintenance fees, et cetera.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   It seems like owning your unit in a high-cost living city
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.320]   is simply paying a premium to have security.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.440]   There's no material gain if investing is commensurate
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.620]   with the mortgage.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.560]   Is this correct?
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   - All right, so the real estate market in New York
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.120]   is frankly foreign to me.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.960]   So let's bring in someone who has lived in New York
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.040]   his whole life, Barry Ritholtz.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.440]   - The blog father. - Barry.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.040]   - Hi, Barry. - All right.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.460]   So Barry, I got this, I got this on my chart.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.240]   John, let's do a chart on real quick.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.820]   So Case Shiller actually has a condominium price index
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.660]   for New York.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.000]   And I looked at this, it goes back to the '90s.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.880]   And we're talking about like a 5% annual gain.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.140]   But that's price only, right?
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.520]   So we're not talking about all the fees and everything.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.040]   What do you think about the returns
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.280]   on a seven-figure Manhattan condo these days?
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.880]   Is it, does it ever make sense
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.380]   or are you just buying convenience by doing that?
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.080]   - So a couple of things.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.640]   First, I don't know where you're getting
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.440]   a three-bedroom apartment in New York City for 1.6.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.320]   That's, you know, I think his data is wildly off.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.840]   So two key things.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.160]   First, you gotta live somewhere.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.760]   You can't live in an ETF.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.680]   You can't live in a mutual fund.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.600]   You have to live in an apartment.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.880]   And there are a lot of non-financial advantages
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.800]   to owning your own space.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.660]   No one's gonna raise the rent on you.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.500]   No one's gonna tell you,
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.100]   "Sorry, not renewing the lease, you gotta go."
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.840]   You can paint colors other than white.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.140]   You can redecorate, buy appliances.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.180]   So there's a lot of trade-offs when you're a renter.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.980]   That said, over the long periods of time,
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.060]   you know, real estate more or less returns
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.700]   zero net of inflation.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.060]   Taxes, maintenance, all these things.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.900]   So the idea that you're thinking about real estate,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.900]   the way the parents of the post-war generation did.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.900]   My parents bought a house for $38,000 and 30 years later,
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.700]   sold it for almost half a million dollars.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.540]   And that house today is probably closer to a million dollars.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.540]   So the baby boom and the post-war generation,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.540]   they had an advantage that you're just not gonna get today.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.060]   There's more people, there's more NIMBY,
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.780]   there's more regulations.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.060]   Real estate isn't as an attractive investment
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.500]   as it once was.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.740]   - Also, I think the last few years,
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.060]   these enormous gains we've seen in the pandemic
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.840]   are gonna screw people's thinking on this
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.380]   in the years ahead, right?
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.220]   - That's right.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.460]   You end up with a baseline that is,
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.660]   you know, suddenly everything is really expensive.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.420]   And if we look at real estate
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.480]   from an investment perspective and say,
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.340]   "Hey, are we buying a growth property or a value property?"
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.940]   Nothing really looks like value properties today.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.180]   And we know what happens if you top-tick growth stocks,
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.100]   you pay a price.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.320]   But the bottom line is you have to live somewhere
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.220]   and the quality of life that you get owning your own
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.940]   property, it might be worth the loss of return.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.780]   - Right.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.900]   So how, explain to me, how egregious are the fees
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.260]   that you pay in some of these condo buildings that you buy?
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.780]   'Cause you have to pay all the upkeep and maintenance fees
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.000]   and it's like, that's part of it
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.580]   that people probably don't think about either, right?
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.340]   - So my wife and I looked at,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.780]   we moved out to the Burbs about 20 years ago.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.820]   I'd lived in the city for a long time.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.220]   And the fantasy was always a pied-a-terre in the city.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.780]   We'll get our own place, we can leave our clothes there.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.940]   We've, you know, I'm stuck at work late at night.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.420]   I could stay at the apartment.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.840]   And the problem is even a modest co-op,
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.520]   you're paying $1,500 a month for co-op fees.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.340]   And that covers the taxes, the maintenance,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.260]   all these different things within the building.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.020]   Well, even expensive New York City real estate,
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.940]   New York City hotels, you go to a decent hotel,
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.260]   it's four, five, $600 a night.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.980]   If I'm paying 1,500 a month every month,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.940]   hey, that's 36 nights in New York City.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.940]   I never spend that much time.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.300]   So the math didn't work.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.840]   If you have to live in the city,
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.380]   well then you're probably gonna have more control
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.180]   and enjoy it more if you own it.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.400]   But it's a cost, it's an expense.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.120]   It's not an investment.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.300]   And the people who got really lucky.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.740]   Now, when I was in grad school,
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.940]   all the co-ops or all the rental buildings
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.740]   were converting to co-ops post '70s.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.420]   So in the '80s and '90s, as interest rates came down,
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.340]   buildings that were once rentals became cooperatives
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.780]   and people started to own it.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.220]   And I know people who bought apartments for 20, 50,
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.220]   $100,000 and sold them for millions.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.060]   That's done, that was a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.600]   And that's not gonna happen again.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.380]   - Aren't A2/A3's essentially like paying rent
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.320]   on top of your mortgage?
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.160]   - You're an owner of the building.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.540]   - 'Cause they can grow up forever, right?
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.700]   - Right, so you're the owner of the building,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.300]   you pay all the salaries, you pay all the maintenance,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.500]   and that's assuming that the elevator didn't die
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.900]   and there's a one-time special assessment
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.600]   that's $4 million divided by 200 residents,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.300]   or the roof needs to be replaced,
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.820]   or the building exterior has to be cleaned,
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.060]   or the windows need to be upgraded.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.460]   You're an owner, the difference with a homeowner
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.180]   is you decide when you replace your windows.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.540]   The board decides when they're gonna do it,
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.700]   and if it's inconvenient to you, too bad.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.420]   - Yeah, and I agree with you that the comparison
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.220]   of an S&P 500 return versus a house,
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.620]   that shouldn't go into this, that's a different story.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.020]   - You gotta build in rent.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.860]   - Exactly, you have to live somewhere.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.620]   - You have to pay in rent and all that other stuff.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.860]   - Right, and I think the average rent in Manhattan right now
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.780]   is $4,000 a month, I think I saw that recently in an article.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.860]   - For a one-bedroom, so I don't know where anyone's
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.300]   buying a three-bedroom for 1.6, that's--
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.660]   Hey, if you find a three, Devin,
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.420]   you can find a nice three-bedroom for 1.6, grab that.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.340]   - Probably should.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.940]   All right, let's do the next one, Duncan.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.220]   - Okay, we have a question from Joshua.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.860]   My grandma is 85 and has about $350,000 to $400,000
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.820]   in an account that an advisor at a big bank manages.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.580]   Ideally, we would take it out and diversify
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.820]   with index funds, as you guys have talked about,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.380]   but I don't think this is an option.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.420]   My grandma does not know anything about the market,
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.660]   and to complicate things, I'm a co-trustee with my aunt
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.700]   over the money and other assets.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.820]   She does not like the advisor we currently have,
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.060]   so I found a highly reputable local wealth management
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.780]   company that is fee-only and charges $3,000 a year
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.460]   to manage a portfolio.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.220]   When I brought it up, she declined and said,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.140]   "Let's just leave it where it's at."
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.420]   She will be visiting in December.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.300]   Any advice on how I can help her see the value
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.900]   in a fee-only service?
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.160]   And can you kind of just briefly describe
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.060]   what this even means for our younger and newer investors?
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.420]   - Yeah, so like fee-only versus,
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.540]   like the old world is brokerage where you're paid
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.100]   based on commissions for selling products,
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.020]   and then fee-only would be, this one sounds like a flat fee,
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.340]   or it could be a percentage of assets,
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.180]   or some people do an hourly fee.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.780]   That's the idea.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.140]   You know, having financial conversations with your family
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.860]   is never easy, but it shouldn't be a taboo subject.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.780]   But Barry, this is a tough one
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.980]   because when my grandma got into her 80s,
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.300]   she was so set in her ways,
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.380]   changing her mind about anything
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.060]   was probably non-existent, it's not gonna happen.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.640]   But with anyone like this in your family,
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.180]   I have these conversations all the time.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.340]   There's some people who just,
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.580]   they know nothing about the financial world, the markets,
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.640]   and maybe they don't want to.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.060]   How do you even start that conversation
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.140]   with someone who just knows nothing?
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.760]   - So first, grandma's 85.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.860]   She has less than half a million dollars in assets.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.500]   She's paying what looks like a 1% fee,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.580]   which normally includes a whole umbrella of services,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.720]   estate planning, tax planning, financial planning.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.700]   I get the sense Joshua's grandma doesn't really need that.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.600]   So she would be, I think she would be better off
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.420]   with a simpler, less expensive approach.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.040]   To answer your question, Ben,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.980]   how do you bring this to someone who's set in their ways?
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.340]   You could say, hey, you know,
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.440]   we could go to self-directed or Vanguard,
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.320]   and you have the Vanguard total market,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.700]   and maybe a Bloomberg Barclays Ag bond fund
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.220]   and an overseas fund,
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.420]   and those three holdings are all you need,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.540]   and we'll save you $3,000 a year.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.980]   You don't have to pay for this.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.380]   So that's one approach.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.780]   I'd rather not see you--
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.500]   - My problem there, though, is that if something goes bad
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.940]   and you say, you know, I'm just gonna take this over for you
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.820]   and put in index funds, when the market goes down,
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.900]   you're getting blamed instead of the advisor.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.180]   And that could make it contentious in the family.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.220]   - Well, you could, you then have to keep a spreadsheet
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.460]   and say, hey, you would have gone down even more
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.820]   if you left it where it was,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.140]   plus we're saving you $3,000 a year.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.340]   So that's absolutely a risk.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.340]   But, you know, I like to get value for what I pay for.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.700]   I don't mind paying my accountant a lot of money
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.200]   if he can, you know, maximize my tax circumstances
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.340]   like you guys were talking about earlier.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.340]   I don't get the sense that she's really getting value
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.460]   for the 3,000 a year.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.140]   Even a robo-advisor, I don't know if that's best
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.780]   for grandma, who probably isn't gonna wanna log in online
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.620]   constantly at 85, but saying,
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.060]   we're just gonna buy the whole market and you're good,
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.900]   and we're saving you three grand a year,
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.360]   I think that's the most persuasive approach with us.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.300]   - Yeah, and the other thing is,
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.820]   if they really want to go into a fee-only service,
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.620]   I think you as a co-trustee, you take that meeting,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.100]   and then you hear it all out, and you lay it out to grandma,
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.420]   here's what you're gonna get,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.540]   and here's what's gonna happen with this money,
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.980]   here's how it could benefit you.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.820]   And I think you lay it out,
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.900]   you kind of give her those two options maybe.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.940]   We could make it easy, we could put you in two index funds
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.620]   and make your life easy and move the cash around for you,
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.180]   or we could have this fee-only service do it
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.300]   for a pretty low fee,
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.900]   and here's all the things they can do as well.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.460]   And just kind of show her what she's not getting right now.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.620]   - The key question is,
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.980]   how much does she need to draw down each month from that?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.540]   And if she doesn't, well, that makes it even easier.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.220]   That's the biggest complication.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.660]   If she says, "Hey, I'm taking 1,000 a month out of this,"
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.100]   or 2,000 a month,
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.460]   well, then it's gonna make it a little more complicated,
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.140]   but you go to Vanguard, you go to Fidelity,
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.260]   you can automate that also.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.820]   So it's really just the initial setup for her.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.100]   - Yeah, so we talked earlier
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.940]   about the most asked questions we get here.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.020]   That's another one that's big for a lot of retirees
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.660]   that listen to the show is,
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.220]   how do I begin to take money out?
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.420]   A lot of people just,
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.660]   accumulation is a lot easier for some people
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.500]   than actually taking it out,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.660]   'cause that's another emotional cost of,
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.100]   well, I'm taking away my life savings.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.900]   How do I spend this down correctly?
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.620]   - That's a tough pivot for people
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.900]   who've spent their whole lives working
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.020]   to turn around and say,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.940]   "Okay, now I'm free to travel, to spend,
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.540]   "to give money away."
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.140]   Emotionally very challenging.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.100]   - Yep, all right, Duncan, last question.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.380]   - Okay, also, Joshua, show your grandma this episode.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.820]   Have her watch some "Portfolio Rescue."
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.300]   And hey, Joshua's grandmother, if you watch this.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.460]   Okay, so last but not least, we have a question from Eric.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.220]   "I'm 50 and have $750,000 in my 401(k)
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.760]   "and $500,000 equity in my house.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.200]   "I was thinking about taking a HELOC out for $250,000
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.640]   "and putting half of it in Google
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.100]   "and the other half in Apple.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.060]   "Does this sound like a feasible plan?"
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.380]   - So my initial thought is no, not a great plan.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.380]   That's the initial thinking.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.220]   But I mean, how do you even think about
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.300]   taking some sort of massive risk like this
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.940]   and position sizing?
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.940]   And I understand the idea of,
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.960]   I have a lot of equity in my home,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.520]   I want to take it out and do something else with it
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.340]   and maybe put it into the market.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.140]   I think maybe the line of thinking here is,
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.400]   if you're investing in some sort of index,
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.620]   if it's a NASDAQ 100,
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.980]   you already got a lot of these names in there.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.100]   Even if it's an S&P 500 index fund,
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.660]   you're probably going to have a lot of exposure
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.740]   to these companies.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.860]   What's the point of making such a huge concentrated bet
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.020]   in two companies like this?
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.140]   - Right, no doubt.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.780]   There's a little survivorship bias there.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.100]   You're looking at the ones that have already done well.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.100]   But it's always a bad idea to leverage yourself up
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.140]   to invest in the stock market.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.560]   Because if the market ends up going down,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.140]   now you're paying a monthly amount on your HELOC
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.440]   for a not especially diversified portfolio.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.580]   If Eric would have said,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.940]   I'm thinking about taking a HELOC and every year,
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.900]   renovating part of my home to make it more valuable
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.520]   and then paying it down.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.860]   And this year I'm replacing the windows
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.160]   and next year I'm replacing the roof,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.100]   like the person in the co-op.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.740]   All right, I could live with that.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.600]   That's a good use of the equity in your home
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.840]   to make that home more valuable if you're managing it.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.580]   But to throw it at two stocks
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.640]   that have already had legendary, spectacular runs,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.880]   it's a bad idea from a leverage perspective.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   But even going into those two stocks is an even worse idea.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.200]   You're just really gambling literally with your home.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.960]   Not quite rent money, but you're gambling with your house.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.440]   And that's rarely a good idea.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.360]   - That's the concentration here is the most,
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   even if you had, let's say,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.500]   take out the HELOC thing out of it.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.160]   You have a lump sum you're investing.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   Putting it into these two stocks.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.680]   I mean, do these two stocks seem like
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.980]   they should be safe bets for the next--
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.180]   - Two, three decades. - So which two stocks
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.060]   would you pick then?
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.140]   (laughing)
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.240]   - Does VTI count?
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.080]   I mean, that's the thing though.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.000]   I mean, in 2000, you probably would have said,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.480]   I'm gonna put all my money in GE
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.040]   'cause they're paying a 4% dividend
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.940]   and this company is so diversified and it can't lose.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.960]   And it's down 80% since then or something.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.480]   - Right, GE and Citi.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.200]   That would have been a great combo bet.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.040]   - Yeah. - Oh boy.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.160]   - And I'm not saying that's going to happen
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   to Apple and Google, but it exists
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.320]   where the stock market can do okay
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.980]   and concentrated positions in stocks like these
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.640]   can do horribly for you.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.980]   So I think the concentration here,
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.560]   I mean, if you really wanna put some money
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.440]   into Apple and Google, make a much smaller bet.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.640]   That's fine, but this is a huge,
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.960]   you're talking about taking potentially 25%
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.680]   of your portfolio into two names.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.440]   That again, you can get a decent amount of exposure
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.840]   in these in an index fund
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.840]   and then you also spread your bets more too.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.360]   - And don't do it with borrowed money.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.800]   If you have to borrow money to invest in the stock market,
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.020]   what you're really saying is you can't afford
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.760]   to make this investment.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.140]   It's one thing you have a 30-year mortgage on a house
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.180]   and you wanna fix it up
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.540]   because it's your single biggest property.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.900]   It's the single biggest asset you have.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.220]   That's one thing.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.300]   But to borrow money to put it into the stock market,
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.220]   that just never works out well in the long run.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.340]   - And you have a higher hurdle rate now
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.820]   because 12 months ago,
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.420]   you're probably talking a 3% HELOC rate.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.820]   Now it's like five and going up
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.920]   as the Fed keeps raising rates.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.240]   It's gonna be a higher hurdle rate too.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.440]   All right, Barry, I have one more question for you.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.840]   - I just have one other thing.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.680]   If Eric did this,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.800]   wouldn't his wife basically become
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.280]   that of a hedge fund manager?
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.480]   Isn't he gonna be tracking this
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.040]   like every minute of every day?
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:52.920]   - That's gonna be an uncomfortable quarterly conference call
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.760]   with the investors each three months.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.200]   - All right, Barry, one more question for you.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.840]   Better form jumping into your pool,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.280]   me or your dog Teddy this week at our pool party?
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.560]   - I gotta give it to Teddy.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.240]   Teddy flies through the air. - Yeah, I think so too.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.080]   That's the right answer.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   - I mean, you did a killer cannonball,
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.340]   but Teddy, who's a Portuguese water dog,
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:17.600]   we open the pool early and keep it open late for him.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.840]   I mean, we open in May and we-
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.600]   - I didn't know he had water dog in his name.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.860]   That was an unfair question.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.020]   - Literally Portuguese water dog.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.460]   I've taken him to the beach in February,
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.600]   throw a stick in the water.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.680]   He's in, he gets it, he brings it out.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.500]   I have some slow-mo videos of him leaping into the pool.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.680]   They're hilarious.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.400]   He's a lot of fun.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.640]   - And he eats watermelon.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.880]   - Yes, he does.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.720]   - That was awesome.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.960]   I fed him some watermelon.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.200]   - He likes watermelon.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   He likes carrots.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.480]   He's a funny little dog.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.920]   - As always, dogs are the best.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.520]   Remember, if you have a question,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.240]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.020]   Thanks again to Barry for his help as always.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.480]   We appreciate it.

[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.180]   - That is right.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.580]   - All right, new one coming.
