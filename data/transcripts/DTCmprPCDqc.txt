[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.560]   Today, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.720]   Dr. Attia is a physician who's focused on nutritional,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.160]   supplementation-based, behavioral, prescription drug,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.640]   and other interventions that promote healthspan
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.020]   and lifespan.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.220]   His expertise spans from exercise physiology
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.680]   to sleep physiology,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.700]   emotional and mental health, and pharmacology.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940]   Today, we talk about all those areas of health,
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.440]   starting with the very basics,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.880]   such as how to evaluate one's own health status
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800]   and how to define one's health trajectory.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.300]   We also talk about the various sorts of interventions
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660]   that one can take in order to optimize vitality
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.080]   while also extending longevity, that is, lifespan.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.300]   Dr. Attia is uniquely qualified
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.320]   to focus on the complete depth and breadth of topics
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.240]   that we cover.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.880]   And indeed, these are the same topics
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.160]   that he works with his patients on in his clinic every day.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.940]   Dr. Attia earned his Bachelor of Science
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.360]   in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.000]   and his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.560]   He then went on to train at Johns Hopkins Hospital
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.480]   in general surgery,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.600]   one of the premier hospitals in the world,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.840]   where he was the recipient of several prestigious awards,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.600]   including resident of the year.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.560]   He's been an author on comprehensive reviews
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.800]   of general surgery.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.620]   He spent two years at the National Institutes of Health
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.560]   as a surgical oncology fellow
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.460]   at the National Cancer Institute,
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.540]   where his work focused on immune-based therapies
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.740]   for melanoma.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.060]   In the fields of science and medicine,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060]   it is well understood that we are much the product
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.760]   of our mentors and the mentoring we receive.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.820]   Dr. Attia has trained with some of the best
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.380]   and most innovative lipidologists, endocrinologists,
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.940]   gynecologists, sleep physiologists,
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.520]   and longevity scientists in the United States and Canada.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.580]   So the expertise that funnels through him
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.420]   and that he shares with us today
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.740]   is really harnessed from the best of the best
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100]   and his extensive training and expertise.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.220]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.180]   you will have answers to important basic questions
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.140]   such as, should you have blood work?
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.040]   How often should you do blood work?
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.940]   What specific things should you be looking for
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.580]   on that blood work that are either counterintuitive
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.300]   or not often discussed,
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.100]   and yet that immediately and in the longterm influence
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.940]   your lifespan and health span?
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.460]   We talk about hormone health and hormone therapies
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.140]   for both men and women.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.780]   We talk about drug therapies that can influence the mind
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.940]   as well as the body.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.100]   And of course, we talk about supplementation, nutrition,
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.840]   exercise, and predictors of lifespan and health span.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.340]   It is an episode rich with information.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.300]   For some of you, you may want to get out a pen and paper
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.580]   in order to take notes.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.820]   For others of you that learn better simply by listening,
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.700]   I just want to remind you
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.500]   that we have timestamped all this information
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   so that you can go back to the specific topics
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.320]   most of interest to you.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.200]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.540]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.740]   We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.460]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.360]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.860]   outside of the United States.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.880]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.420]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.100]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.020]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.660]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.860]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.920]   and that are supplied in dosages
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.900]   that allow you to build a supplementation protocol
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.620]   that's optimized for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.760]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.080]   from your protocol in a way
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.880]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.040]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.360]   that we partner with Momentous on,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.480]   you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.600]   There you'll see those supplements
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.080]   and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.760]   the library of supplements available through Momentous
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.720]   on a regular basis.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.320]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.860]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.620]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.000]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.680]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.400]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.320]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.240]   Thesis makes custom nootropics
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.840]   that are designed for your unique needs.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.100]   And to be honest, I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.460]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.960]   And to be honest, there is no such thing as a smart drug
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.120]   because there's no neural circuit for being smart.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.560]   There are neural circuits rather for being creative
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.700]   or for task switching or for focus.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.840]   And as we all know, different sorts of demands,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.480]   whether or not they are cognitive or physical,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.340]   require different types of cognitive and physical abilities.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.960]   Thesis understands this and has created a kit
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.720]   of custom nootropics that are tailored to your needs.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.860]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.260]   you can go to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.720]   take their three-minute quiz,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.600]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.880]   to try in your first month.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.040]   That's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.960]   and use the code Huberman at checkout to get 10% off
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.320]   your first box of custom nootropics.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.080]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.640]   to help you better understand your body
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.600]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.120]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.220]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.240]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.560]   can only be assessed from a quality blood test.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.300]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.000]   you can also analyze, for instance,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.460]   what your biological age is
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.260]   and compare it to your chronological age.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.760]   And obviously it's your biological age that really matters.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.240]   The challenge with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.320]   however, is that you get information back
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   about metabolic factors, hormones, and so forth,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.680]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   InsideTracker makes it very easy to know what to do
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.580]   with that information to optimize your health.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.240]   They have a personalized platform.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.860]   It's a dashboard that you go to.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.300]   You can click on the level of any hormone, metabolic factor,
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.280]   lipid, et cetera, and it will tell you
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.960]   the various sorts of interventions
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.400]   based on nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   that you can use to bring those numbers
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.520]   into the ranges that are ideal for you.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.920]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.660]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.460]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.360]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.400]   They also have some really unique features
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.900]   because they are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.740]   I've talked over and over again on this podcast
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.600]   and on other podcasts about the fact
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.080]   that sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.660]   physical health, and performance.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.500]   There's just simply no other substitute
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.000]   for a quality night's sleep on a regular basis.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.380]   I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.420]   for well over a year now,
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.340]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.740]   And that's in large part
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.480]   because the mattress was designed for me.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.460]   What you need to know, however,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.020]   is what's the ideal mattress for you?
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.360]   And you can do that by going to Helix's site.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.680]   You can take their brief quiz,
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.580]   which will ask you, do you sleep on your side,
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.140]   your back, your stomach, or maybe you don't know,
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.980]   or maybe all three,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.520]   do you tend to run hot or cold in the night?
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.480]   Maybe you know, maybe you don't.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   At the end of that short quiz,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.180]   they will match you to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.500]   I matched to the DUSK, the D-U-S-K mattress,
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.020]   but again, that's what I need.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.180]   That's not necessarily what you need
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.060]   in order to get your best night's sleep.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.620]   But if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.860]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.100]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.940]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.220]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.400]   and two free pillows.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.280]   They have terrific pillows.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.420]   And you get to try out that mattress
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.620]   for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.580]   They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.780]   but I'm certain you will.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.740]   Again, if you're interested in you,
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.080]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.480]   for up to $200 off your mattress order and two free pillows.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.620]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.220]   Peter, thanks for joining me today.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.180]   - Thanks for having me, man.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.780]   - I'm looking forward to this for a very long time.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.620]   - That's fine.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.260]   - I'm a huge fan of your podcast.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.100]   I know that you went to Stanford
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.340]   and worked with a number of people
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.580]   that are colleagues of mine.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.580]   So for me, this is already a thrill just to be doing this.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.480]   - Yeah, well, likewise.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.980]   - I have a ton of questions,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.300]   but I want to start off with something
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.700]   that I wonder a lot about
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.780]   and that I know many other people wonder about,
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.020]   which is how to assess their current health
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.700]   and their trajectory in terms of health and wellbeing,
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.660]   specifically as it relates to blood work.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.860]   So what are your thoughts on blood work?
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.860]   Is it necessary for the typical person?
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.140]   So this is somebody who's not dealing
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.740]   with some acute syndrome or illness,
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.780]   and at what age would you suggest
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.060]   people start getting blood work?
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.520]   How frequently should they get blood work?
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.580]   How often do you get blood work done, et cetera?
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.420]   - Yeah, there's a lot there.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.940]   I mean, the way I talk about this with patients
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.380]   is first taking everything back to the objective.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.900]   So what's the thing we're trying to optimize?
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.120]   So if a person says,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.000]   "Look, I'm trying to break 10 hours for an Ironman.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.200]   I don't know that blood work is going to be a game-changing
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.280]   aspect of their trajectory and their training."
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.740]   They're going to benefit much more
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.760]   from sort of functional analysis of performance.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.360]   So I'm assuming, based on the question,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.480]   that you're really coming at this through the lens
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.540]   of living longer and living better
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.560]   through the lifespan, healthspan lens?
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.680]   - Yeah, and just, I think most people have some sense
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.940]   of their vitality or lack of vitality,
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.420]   but I think everyone wonders whether or not
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.260]   they could feel better
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.140]   and whether or not blood work will give them a window
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.020]   into how they might go about feeling better.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.920]   - Yeah, I think it does to some extent,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.260]   but I also think that it has a lot of blind spots.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.260]   So I kind of break things down into the two vectors
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.560]   that make up longevity, which are lifespan and healthspan.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.620]   So lifespan is the easiest of those vectors to understand
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.200]   because it's pretty binary, right?
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.460]   You're alive or you're not alive.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.580]   You're respiring or you're not.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.080]   You make ATP or you don't, end of story.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   So what gets in the way of lifespan
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.920]   is essentially the four horsemen of disease, right?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.880]   So atherosclerotic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.120]   and metabolic disease,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.140]   which directly isn't the cause of many deaths,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.000]   but basically creates the foundation
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.600]   to all of those other diseases.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.420]   So if you're a non-smoker, what I just rattled off
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.040]   is about 80% of your death.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   So how does blood work help address those?
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.880]   It varies.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.600]   So on the atherosclerotic standpoint,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   it's a very good predictor of risk
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   if you know what to look for.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.440]   So primarily ApoB would be the single most important
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.200]   lipoprotein that we care about.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.440]   I gotta explain what that means in a second.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.080]   And then also, you know, other markers of inflammation,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.600]   endothelial health and metabolic health.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.040]   When it comes to cancer, you know,
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.480]   blood testing in the sense of biomarkers
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.560]   is not particularly helpful.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.200]   Outside of knowing that the second leading environmental
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.920]   or modifiable cause of cancer
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.720]   is metabolic ill health after smoking.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.880]   So we don't actually know a lot about cancer
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   in the sense of what causes it.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.520]   It's really stochastic and it's a lot of bad luck.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.240]   So we know that smoking drives it.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.680]   And we know that even though epidemiologically,
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.900]   we say obesity drives it,
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.880]   what it really means is metabolic poor health.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.560]   It's probably the hyperinsulinemia
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.740]   that comes with obesity that drives it.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.820]   So biomarkers help with that,
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.880]   but there's still an enormous blind spot to cancer.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.680]   We could talk about liquid biopsies aside
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.560]   'cause those aren't really biomarker studies,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.380]   but put that away.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.520]   On the neurodegenerative side,
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.160]   you know, I don't think we have a lot of insight
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.640]   that comes to understanding Parkinson's disease.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.860]   But when it comes to dementia,
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.160]   particularly the Alzheimer's disease,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.740]   which is the most prevalent form of dementia,
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.940]   I think the biomarkers can be quite helpful.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.500]   They overlap a lot with the atherosclerotic diseases.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.520]   So the same things that, you know,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   drive the risk of heart disease
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.160]   or driving the risk of dementia.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.100]   And then there's some novel stuff as well.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.420]   If you include genetic testing,
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.020]   which you can get out of a blood test,
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.960]   we get a whole suite of genes,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.100]   not just APOE, but far more, you know,
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.740]   nuanced stuff than that that can also play a role.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.920]   So you can stratify risk in that sense.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   So in aggregate, I would say, you know,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.620]   blood testing of biomarkers provides pretty good insight
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.800]   into lifespan.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.840]   When you get into healthspan,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.780]   you have kind of the cognitive, physical, emotional domains.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.460]   I think here the biomarkers are far less helpful.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.260]   And here we kind of rely more on functional testing.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.340]   So when it comes to sort of the cognitive piece, you know,
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.300]   you can do cognitive testing.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.640]   In terms of long-term risk,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.600]   a lot of the things that imply good cognitive health
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.300]   as you age are in line with the same things
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.600]   that you would do to reduce the risk of dementia.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.800]   So all the biomarkers that you would look to improve
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.180]   through dementia risk reduction,
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.740]   you would be improving through cognitive health.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.900]   On the physical side, I mean,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.420]   outside of looking at hormone levels and things,
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.060]   which we look at extensively
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.180]   and understanding how those might aid in
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.500]   or prevent some of the metrics that matter,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.140]   it really is, this is a biomarker aside thing.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.660]   I mean, I'd be much more interested in a person's DEXA,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.700]   CPET testing, VO2 max testing, you know,
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.780]   Zone 2 lactate testing, fat oxidation,
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.060]   those what I would consider more functional tests
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.320]   that give me far more insight into that.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.560]   And then of course the emotional piece,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.900]   which depending on who you are,
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.360]   might be the single most important piece
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.920]   without which none of this other stuff matters, right?
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.940]   If you're a totally miserable human being,
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.800]   your relationships suck.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.460]   I don't think any of this other stuff matters.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.800]   And certainly there's nothing that I'm looking at
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.820]   in biomarkers that's giving me great insight into that.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.480]   - Do you ask about emotional state
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.640]   or do you try and assess emotional state indirectly
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   when you do an intake with one of your patients?
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.420]   - Probably not so much in the intake
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.660]   because I think it takes a while to form a relationship
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.920]   with a patient before that starts to become something
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.420]   that they're necessarily gonna wanna talk with you about.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.340]   But I definitely think of it
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.780]   as an important part of what we do.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.820]   And I think without it,
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.560]   none of this other stuff really matters.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.060]   Again, the irony of thinking about how many years I spent
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.280]   sort of in pursuit of fully optimizing
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.620]   every detail of everything
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.580]   without any attention being paid to that dimension
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.020]   is not lost on me.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.680]   And look, there are some patients who they,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.780]   that's just not something that,
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.260]   that's something that's compartmentalized.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.100]   Maybe they're doing well in that department
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.940]   or maybe they aren't,
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.820]   but they just aren't willing to engage on that yet.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.820]   - In terms of frequency of blood testing,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.220]   if somebody feels pretty good
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.380]   and is taking a number of steps,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.280]   exercise, nutrition, et cetera,
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.980]   to try and extend lifespan and improve healthspan,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.740]   is once a year frequent enough?
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.040]   And should a 20-year-old start getting blood work done
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.740]   just to get a window into what's going on,
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.820]   assuming that they can afford it
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.280]   or their insurance can cover it?
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.120]   - Yeah, I mean, look,
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.580]   I certainly think everybody should be screened early in life
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.580]   because if you look at,
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.040]   like what's the single most prevalent genetic driver
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.540]   of atherosclerosis is Lp little a.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.100]   So unfortunately, most physicians don't know
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.080]   what Lp little a is,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.020]   and yet somewhere between eight and 12% of the population
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:40.880]   has a high enough,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.180]   and depending on who you, you know,
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.660]   I had a recent guest on my podcast
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.740]   who suggested it could be as high as 20%
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.120]   have a high enough Lp little a
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.080]   that it is contributing to atherosclerosis.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.900]   So to not want to know that
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.300]   when it's genetically determined, right?
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.820]   This is something that, you know,
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.680]   you're born with this
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.220]   and you only need to really check it once.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.500]   Why we wouldn't want to know that in a 20-year-old
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.700]   when it can contribute
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.860]   to a lot of the early atherosclerosis we see in people,
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.200]   you know, it just, you know,
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.420]   it's leaving money on the table in my opinion.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.960]   The frequency with which you need to test
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.280]   really comes down to the state of interventions.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.060]   You know, I don't think it makes sense
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.200]   to just do blood tests for the sake of doing blood tests.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.400]   There has to be kind of a reason.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.360]   Is something changing?
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.180]   You know, a blood test is for the most part
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.040]   a static intervention.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.840]   It's a look at a window in time,
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.880]   and there's benefit in having, you know,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.440]   a few of those over the course of a year
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.200]   if you're unsure about a level.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.600]   So if something comes back and it doesn't look great,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.200]   yeah, it might make sense just to recheck it
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.800]   without reacting to it.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.320]   But typically, you know, in patients,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.580]   we might check blood two to four times a year,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.640]   but we're also probably doing things in there
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   to now check like, hey, you know,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.180]   we gave this drug, did it have the desired outcome?
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.640]   You know, you put on three pounds of muscle
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.920]   and lost three pounds of fat,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.520]   did it have the desired outcome?
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.880]   - Speaking of tracking weight
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.240]   and fat lean mass percentages,
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.000]   is that something that you recommend
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.500]   your patients do pretty often?
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.000]   I know people that step on the scale every day,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.960]   I know people like myself that, frankly,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.720]   I might step on the scale three times a year.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.280]   I don't really care.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.640]   I pay attention to other things
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   that are far more subjective.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.960]   Maybe I'm making a huge mistake.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.200]   What are your thoughts about quantitative measurements
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   of weight BMI for the typical person?
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.760]   - I think they're pretty crude.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.960]   I think a DEXA, I'd rather take a DEXA annually
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.400]   and then maybe follow weight a little bit more closely
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   to get a sense of it.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.920]   And so with a DEXA, you're getting,
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.460]   at least the way we look at the data,
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.520]   four pieces of information.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.520]   Now, most people, when they do a DEXA,
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.800]   should I explain what that is?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.080]   - Yeah, I think some people might not know what DEXA is.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.660]   In fact, I confess I have a crude understanding
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.500]   of what it is.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.800]   Tell me where I'm wrong
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.040]   and hopefully where I'm at least partially right.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.760]   My understanding is that there are a number of different ways
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.080]   to measure lean mass to non-lean mass ratio.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.520]   And there's one where they put you underwater.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.360]   There's one where they put you
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.920]   into some sort of non-underwater chamber.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.380]   There's calipering.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.680]   And then there's the looking in the mirror
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.400]   and pinching and changing the lighting.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.440]   - It's funny, if you've done it enough,
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.720]   I can sort of tell my body fat by my abs, right?
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.440]   So I can sort of tell by how good the six pack
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.620]   or how bad the six pack is, what the leanness is.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.480]   And that's actually not a terrible way to do it.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.880]   There are, a bodybuilder, for example,
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.480]   which I've never been, can tell you the difference
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   between being 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%,
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   just based on the degree of visibility within the abs.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.720]   But basically a DEXA scan is an X-ray.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   So it's the same principle as just getting a chest X-ray
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.560]   where ionizing radiation is passed through the body
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.080]   and there's a plate behind the body
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.820]   that collects what comes through.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.720]   And the denser the medium
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.420]   that the electrons are trying to go through,
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.840]   the less of them that are collected.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.020]   So when you look at an X-ray, as everybody's probably seen,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.800]   an X-ray, that which is white is most dense.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.280]   So if you had a piece of metal in your pocket,
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.760]   it would show up as a bright white thing.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.560]   That's why ribs and bones show up as white.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.960]   And the things that are the least dense,
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.320]   like the lungs where it's just air, are the blackest.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.600]   And everything is a shade of gray in between.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.560]   So a DEXA is just doing that effectively,
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.800]   but it's a moving X-ray.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.840]   So you lay down on a bed and it takes maybe 10 minutes
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.320]   and this little, very low power X-ray
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.120]   kind of goes over your body.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.400]   And the plate beneath it is collecting information
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.880]   that is basically allowing it to differentiate
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.880]   between three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.400]   And the other is quantified as lean body mass.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.540]   So that's organs, muscles, everything else.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.640]   So when most people do a DEXA, they get the report back,
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.720]   and the reports are horrible.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.640]   I've yet to see one company that can do this
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.760]   in a way that isn't abjectly horrible.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.240]   We've created our own templates.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.940]   So we have our own dashboard for how we do this
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.340]   'cause we've just given up on trying to use theirs.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.520]   But the first thing most people look at
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.760]   is what's my body fat?
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.960]   And this is the gold standard outside of like MRI
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.000]   or something that's only used for research purposes.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   So a DEXA is going to produce a far better estimate
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.460]   of body fat than calipers or buoyancy testing
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.760]   or things like that, provided the machinery
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.720]   is well calibrated and the operator knows how to use it.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.200]   I've heard some people argue that in the hands
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.600]   of the guy who's been doing calipers his whole life,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.460]   it could probably be comparable with calipers.
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.760]   But nevertheless, for an off-the-shelf tech,
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.680]   DEXA is amazing.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.560]   Of the four things that get spit out of the DEXA,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.380]   we think that the body fat is the least interesting.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.120]   And so I would rank that as fourth on the list
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.020]   of what's germane to your health.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.920]   The other three things that you get spit out
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.960]   are bone mineral density, visceral fat,
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   and then the metrics that allow you to basically compute
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.220]   what's called appendicular lean mass index
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.940]   and fat-free mass index.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.120]   And so those three metrics are significantly more important
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.480]   than body fat.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.720]   And the reason is as follows.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.380]   So bone mineral density basically speaks
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.800]   to your risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.220]   And that doesn't sound very sexy to people our age.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.780]   50-year-old guy is listening to this.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.760]   It's like, yeah, big deal.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.840]   But for a 50-year-old woman, this is a huge deal, right?
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.680]   A woman who's just about to go through menopause
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.780]   or has just gone through menopause is at an enormous risk
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.940]   for osteopenia and then ultimately osteoporosis
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.180]   because estrogen is the single most important hormone
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.100]   in regulating bone mineral density.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.000]   And we can come back and talk about why that's the case,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.120]   but it's very interesting how the biomechanics
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   of bones work and why estrogen specifically is so important.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.480]   And this is a huge cause of morbidity, right?
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.840]   So if you're over the age of 65 and you fall
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.800]   and break your hip, your one-year morbidity
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.760]   is about 30 to 40%.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.800]   Which again, just to put that in English,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.120]   if you're 65 or older, you fall and break your hip,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.440]   there's a 30 to 40% chance you're dead in a year.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.020]   - Wow. - Bones matter.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.940]   So we want to really get a sense of where you stack up
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.440]   for your age, for your sex, and if you're anywhere
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.920]   off the pace, we have to ramp up our strategy
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.480]   and be super aggressive about how to increase that
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.400]   or at a minimum, prevent any further decay.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.060]   - And are there age-related charts for these sorts of things?
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.160]   - Yeah, this all gets spit out into what's called a z-score.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.480]   So when you're looking at your BMD,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.600]   it's gonna give you a z-score.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.200]   So a z-score of zero means, and you understand this,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.800]   but it's z-score referring to a probability distribution
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.720]   in a standard mode.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.460]   So z-score of zero means you're at the 50th percentile
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.460]   for your age and sex.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.200]   A z-score of plus one, you're one standard deviation above,
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.300]   minus one below, et cetera.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.800]   There's also a t-score, which is doing the same thing,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.600]   but comparing you to a young person.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.200]   And so the t-score is technically used to make the diagnosis
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.800]   of osteopenia or osteoporosis.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.180]   We tend to look more at the z-score and basically say,
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.560]   look, if your z-score right now is minus one in four years,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.120]   I want your z-score to be zero.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.460]   Not necessarily because you've increased that entire way,
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.160]   but maybe you've increased slightly
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.980]   while it's expected that you would have declined.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.820]   - I see.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.220]   What are some things that we can do
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.900]   to improve bone mineral density at any age?
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.420]   - So it turns out there's a real critical window
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.100]   in which we are malleable.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.580]   So depending on the age at which someone's listening to us
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.400]   discuss this, if you're under 20, 25,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.780]   you are still in that time of your life
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.560]   when you are able to reach your potential.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.060]   So it turns out that strength training is probably
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.340]   the single best thing you can do.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.660]   And this was a surprise to me 'cause we did an AMA
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.420]   on this topic a little while ago,
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.780]   and that's when I got really deep on this with our analysts.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.300]   My assumption was running must be the best.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.940]   Some sort of impact must be the best thing you can do.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.680]   I assumed running would be better than swimming and cycling,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.180]   but it turned out that powerlifting
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.820]   was probably the best thing you could do.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.220]   And I think once you understand how bones work,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.500]   it became more clear, which is,
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.460]   powerlifting is really putting more of a shear force
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.120]   from the muscle via the tendon onto the bone.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.040]   And that's what the bones are really sensing.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.780]   They're sensing that shear force that's being applied
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.720]   through the bone in a compressive way,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.420]   depending on the bone, of course.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.320]   And that's what's basically activating the osteoblasts,
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.320]   which are the cells that are allowing bone to be built.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.980]   So this turns out to be probably more important for females.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.280]   Because how high you can get
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.740]   during that period of development,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.580]   say till you're 20 or 25,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.660]   basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your life.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.260]   So where we get into real trouble
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.780]   is with patients who, for example,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.220]   used large amounts of inhaled steroids
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.100]   during that period of their life,
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.340]   'cause let's say they had really bad asthma.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.220]   Or patients who needed large amounts of corticosteroids
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.260]   for some other immune-related condition.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.140]   So during their critical window of development,
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.660]   they were taking a drug that was impairing this process.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.940]   So we have some patients like that in our practice,
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.220]   and that's just an enormous liability
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.840]   that we're working really hard to overcome,
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.900]   with nutrition, with hormones, with drugs, with training.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:41.020]   And it's just something you have to be aware of.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.660]   - I wasn't aware that inhalants for asthma
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.460]   and things of that sort can impair bone mineral density.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.060]   - Yeah, they're steroid-based.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.780]   Some of them, of course, are just beta agonists,
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.620]   and they're fine.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.780]   - So anything corticosterone-like?
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.700]   - Yep. - Interesting.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.420]   And then I always get asked this question,
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.140]   and I always reflexively want to say no,
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.780]   but I don't really know the answer, so I don't reply.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.540]   What about topical corticosterone?
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.740]   People will put cortisone cream.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.540]   To me, it seems almost inconceivable
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.900]   that it would have a systemic effect,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.180]   but then again, what do I know?
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.340]   - It's all dosing and time-related.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.980]   So if you're talking about,
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.900]   I've got a little rash under my skin,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.400]   I'm going to put corticosteroids on, probably not.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.580]   But certainly with enough of it put on,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.880]   I mean, it is absorbed, so it could be an issue.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.060]   But that's not typically what we're concerned with.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.520]   I mean, we're mostly concerned with people
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.420]   that are taking even modest amounts of prednisone
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.080]   for months, years at a time,
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.860]   or like I said, kids that are using steroid inhalers
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.500]   for years and years and years.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.080]   Again, I'm not suggesting that if your kid's
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.580]   on a steroid inhaler, they shouldn't be.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.620]   You have to solve the most important problem,
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.740]   and if asthma is the most important problem, so be it.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.620]   I think you just want to turn that into,
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.740]   okay, well, how much more imperative is it
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.740]   that our kid is doing things
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.880]   that are putting a high amount of stress on their bones
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.680]   and via their muscles to make sure
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.940]   that they're in that maximal capacity to build?
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.180]   - Do you think that somebody in their 30s or 40s or 50s
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.900]   could still benefit from strength training
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.220]   in terms of bone mineral density and longevity
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.720]   as it relates to bone mineral density,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.260]   given that there was this key window earlier,
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.100]   or they might've missed that window?
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.060]   - Oh yeah, no, no, this is essential for the rest of life
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.300]   because you're now trying to prevent the fall off.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.680]   So basically the way it works is you're sort of,
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.820]   from birth to say 20, you're in growth.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.180]   From 20 to 50, you plateau.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.740]   At 50, men start to decline, but it's really small.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.860]   Women start to decline, and it's precipitous.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.720]   - And it's related to the drop in estrogen
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.820]   associated with menopause or pre-menopause.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.660]   - Correct.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.120]   - And can we get into any of the broad contours
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.860]   of what that strength training looks like?
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.740]   We had Dr. Andy Galpin on the show.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.300]   He talked a lot about ways to build strength
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.620]   versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.340]   I think there's pretty good agreement
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.780]   across the fields of physiotherapy, et cetera,
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.460]   of physiology and medicine in terms of how to do that.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.620]   But my understanding is fairly low repetition ranges.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.680]   So this is anywhere from one to six repetitions,
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.940]   typically not aiming for a pump hypertrophy,
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.640]   that sort of thing, but heavy loads that are hard to move,
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.020]   80% of one repetition maximum or more
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.620]   done with long rest periods,
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.980]   two to three times a week type thing.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.820]   Is that about right?
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.740]   - Yeah, if you look at the literature on this,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.080]   it's going to tell you,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.440]   it's going to differentiate powerlifting from weightlifting.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.380]   In other words, yeah, you do need to be kind of moving
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.480]   against a very heavy load.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.820]   Now, again, that can look very different
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.840]   depending on your level of experience.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.280]   Like, I really like deadlifting.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.300]   Now, I mean, I can count the number of days left in my life
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.300]   when I'm going to want to do sets over 400 pounds,
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.280]   but I'll pick and choose the days that I do.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.000]   But I grew up doing those things.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.580]   I'm comfortable with those movements.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   If I had a 60-year-old woman
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.260]   who's never lifted weights in her life
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.880]   who we now have to get lifting,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.700]   I mean, we could get her to deadlift,
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.780]   but I think I wouldn't make perfect the enemy of good.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.780]   I'd be happy to put her on a leg press machine
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.200]   and just get her doing that.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.120]   You know, it's not as pure a movement as a deadlift,
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.020]   but who cares, right?
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.600]   We can still put her at a heavy load for her
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.060]   and do so safely.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.700]   So, now, that said, I mean,
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.860]   there was a study that was done in Australia,
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.640]   and hopefully we can find a link to it.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.180]   There's a video on YouTube that actually kind of has the PI
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.540]   sort of walking through the results.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.380]   I could send it to you after, and it's just amazing.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.060]   They took a group of older women.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.620]   They looked like they were in their 60s or 70s
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.340]   who had never lifted weights in their life,
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.900]   who had osteopenia, and some probably already
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.100]   had osteoporosis, and they basically just put them
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.680]   on a strength training protocol.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.740]   And it is remarkable to watch these women.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.980]   They're doing good mornings.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.820]   They're doing deadlifts.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.940]   They're picking heavy things up off the ground.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.660]   I think one woman was picking up,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.560]   God, I wanna say she was like picking like 50,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.860]   60 kilos up off the ground.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.560]   I mean, just staggering sums of weight
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.620]   for these women who have never done anything,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.340]   and their bone health is improving at this age.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.340]   So the goal, frankly, is to just never get to the point
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.200]   where you have to do this for the first time.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.700]   Strength training is such an essential part
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.420]   of our existence that it's never too late to start,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.540]   but you should never stop.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.380]   - Love that advice.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.460]   Is it a systemic effect or a local effect?
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.660]   So for instance, let's say that,
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.820]   well, my mother's in her late 70s.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.780]   She actually used to be really strong when we were kids.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.740]   She could move this fish tank that was in my room
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.620]   long before I could move it, and she's really strong.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.920]   Over the years, I wouldn't call her frail by any means,
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.780]   but I certainly think she could benefit
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.940]   from some strength training.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.200]   Let's say she were to start doing some leg presses
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.760]   or start even with air squats
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.060]   and maybe work up to some pushups.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.060]   Are the effects all local?
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.340]   Meaning if she were to just train her legs
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.940]   or just do pushups, would it only be the loads applied
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.060]   to the limbs and muscles and tissues that were involved?
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.420]   - I think that's where the bulk of it is, yeah.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.260]   - Okay.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.180]   So you need to train the whole body, essentially.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.300]   - Yeah, now keep in mind,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.020]   the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.700]   is based on only three locations,
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.220]   the left hip, the right hip, and the lumbar spine.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.020]   So that's just the convention
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.300]   by which we make the diagnosis.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.920]   And I think part of that has to do with
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.020]   that's where the majority of the insults occur.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.420]   Now, not all of the insults.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.500]   I've seen people that have,
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.180]   because of horrible bone density,
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.820]   they're fracturing ankles and tibia, fibula,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.000]   like they're having low tib fib fractures just walking.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.340]   So clearly bone density outside of those regions
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.220]   does matter, but much of it is really focused on,
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.020]   and by the way, you know, you fall, you break a wrist.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.060]   So this is a systemic issue,
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.200]   but the majority of the response is a local response
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.220]   'cause it really comes down to
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.080]   putting a load directly on that bone
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.140]   and then having that bone in kind respond
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.140]   by laying down more bone.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.380]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.460]   I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.660]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.940]   Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.380]   is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.440]   that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.180]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.600]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.220]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.160]   and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.060]   is that it supplies total foundational coverage
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.460]   of my vitamin mineral needs,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.380]   and it supplies important nutrients that I need
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.940]   to support my gut microbiome.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.680]   The gut microbiome, as many of you know,
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.780]   supports the immune system.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.820]   It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.180]   which is vital for mood, for energy levels,
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.460]   for regulating focus,
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.280]   and many other features of our mental health
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.600]   and physical health that impact our daily performance
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.240]   and high performance in any endeavors
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.620]   we might be involved in.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.020]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.700]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.300]   and claim a special offer.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.960]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.800]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.040]   And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.120]   for all sorts of things like hormone health
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.520]   and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.720]   and calcium regulation.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.920]   Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.640]   to claim that special offer.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   - You mentioned falling and the problems with falling
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.780]   and breaking things and mortality related to that.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.080]   I wonder whether or not there are also health-related
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.920]   effects of just having weak bones
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.480]   that are not just about falling and breaking a bone
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.480]   and dying a year later, even though that's obviously
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.000]   very severe, because I think when people hear about that,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.360]   some people might think, well, I'll just be more careful.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.300]   I'll just move more slowly.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.880]   I'll sit in a wheelchair if I need to,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.280]   even though I might be able to walk
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.440]   if it keeps me from falling.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.560]   Some people I think adopt that mentality.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.040]   What are some of the benefits of having
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.800]   high bone mineral density for men and women
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.840]   that are perhaps independent of risk of injury?
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.160]   - Well, I think it's actually the inverse
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.200]   of what you just said, right?
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.280]   It's sort of like, you have to sort of be able
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.700]   to articulate what it is you want in your marginal decade.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.380]   So we use this thing in our practice
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.760]   called the marginal decade.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.840]   Marginal decade is the last decade of your life.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.780]   So everyone will have a marginal decade.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.960]   That's the only thing I can tell you
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.400]   with absolute certainty, right?
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.240]   - I believe you.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.720]   - There's no immortality, there's no hidden elixir
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.160]   that's gonna help us live to be, you know, whatever.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.420]   I mean, we're all gonna be in our last decade at some point.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.240]   And outside of people who die suddenly
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.280]   or through an accident, most of us know
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.960]   when we're in that marginal decade.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.480]   You might not know the day you enter it,
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.800]   but most people, you know, who are old enough,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.780]   if you tell them, are you in the last decade of your life,
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.920]   they probably have a sense that they are.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   So I think the exercise that we like to go through
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.600]   with our patients very early on is have them
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.280]   in exquisite detail, more detail than they've ever considered
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.980]   so we have to prompt them with like 50 questions,
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.580]   lay out what their marginal decade should look like.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.680]   - Wow, that's a serious exercise.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.180]   - It's a very serious exercise, right?
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.800]   Like what, tell me everything that is going to happen
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.640]   in your marginal decade.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.720]   I don't know when it's gonna be, Andrew.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.400]   It could be '87 to '97 if we're doing well, right?
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.840]   It might be '79 to '89, I don't know.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.840]   But it would really be a very nuanced exploration
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.620]   of that topic.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.480]   And I think until you do that, all of this other stuff
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.640]   is just abstract and kind of nonsense.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.640]   You know, until a person can tell you what it is
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.720]   that they want to be doing in that last decade,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.900]   you can't design a program to get them there.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.960]   I mean, think about it.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.760]   You know, someone wants to do an Ironman.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.840]   We take it for granted that we know what the objective is.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.480]   I have to be able to swim two and a half miles.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.440]   I have to be able to get out, take my wetsuit off,
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.740]   hop on my bike, ride 112 miles, get off my bike,
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.500]   take the bike shoes off, put the run shoes on,
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.100]   run 26.2 miles, like we get it.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.420]   We know what the objective is.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.940]   And only by knowing that can you train.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.420]   Can you imagine if I said to you,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.580]   Andrew, I'm going to have you do an athletic event
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.540]   in a year, start training.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.420]   I'm not gonna tell you what it is, just do it.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.400]   It could be playing basketball.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.820]   You know, it could be swimming to Catalina Island.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.140]   It could be running a hundred miles.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.260]   You wouldn't be able to do it.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.760]   So similarly, if we don't know what our marginal decade
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.200]   is meant to be, there's no way to train for it.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.520]   - Do you think this is a good exercise
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.000]   for anyone and everyone to do on their own
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.840]   regardless of age?
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.600]   Here I'm hearing this and I'm thinking,
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.320]   I need to think about when my last decade might be
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.120]   and what I want that to look like.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.940]   I mean, when I say we do it with our patients,
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.620]   that's only because that's the population I work with,
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.360]   but there's simply no reason everybody
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.120]   shouldn't be going through this exercise.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.060]   - And then you sort of back script from there,
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.200]   figure out what people should be doing
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.560]   given their current health status.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.400]   - That's exactly right.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.300]   We call it back casting.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.620]   So the first step we do is once we've really delineated
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.780]   what the objective function looks like,
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.260]   we then say, okay, how do you break down that
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.220]   into metrics that we can measure?
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.620]   So, you know, you described doing a whole bunch of things.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.700]   Okay, just to let you know, to do that,
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.620]   we'll require a VO2 max of 30 milliliters
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.180]   of oxygen per minute per kilogram.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.120]   And the person will say, okay, what does that mean?
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.700]   We'll say, well, that's a measure of your maximal uptake
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.700]   of oxygen, and that declines at about 8% to 10% per decade.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.680]   So if you have to be at 30, and let's just assume
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.700]   you're gonna be doing that at 90,
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.020]   so what do you need to be at 80, 70, 60, 50?
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.220]   Okay, here's what it would need to be at 50.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.540]   Okay, what are you now?
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.060]   Ah, there's a big gap.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.320]   You're below where you need to be now.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.720]   So you're obviously higher than 30 now,
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.940]   but if you're only at 42 now,
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.940]   and you need to be at 30 and 40 years,
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.140]   you're not gonna cut it.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.700]   You have to be a lot fitter.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.660]   Okay, now let's do the same exercise
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.920]   around strength and stability.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.860]   And without exception, most people,
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.500]   when they do this exercise, will find out
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.900]   they're well below where they need to be.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.900]   So the gravity of aging is more vicious than people realize,
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.400]   and therefore the height of your glider
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.900]   needs to be much higher than you think it is
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.640]   when you're our age.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.040]   If you wanna be able to do the things we probably
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.140]   wanna be able to do when we're 90.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.160]   - I absolutely love this approach.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.760]   I've never done it in terms of my health.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.240]   I've always thought about what I wanna accomplish
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.480]   in the next three to six months or next year or so.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.980]   - And by the way, that's a great approach.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.920]   That's forecasting.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.200]   Forecasting is fantastic.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.300]   Forecasting is really good at short-term things.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.380]   It doesn't work for long-term things.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.860]   Long-term, you have to do backcasting.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.760]   - This backcasting approach really appeals to me
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.960]   because in my career, well, I never anticipated,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.280]   excuse me, I never anticipated I'd be podcasting,
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.560]   but that's what I did.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.440]   At some point as an undergraduate, I looked,
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.440]   professors, I think that looks like a pretty good life.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.260]   They seem pretty happy.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.360]   I talked to a few of them and then I figured out
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.560]   what I need to do at each stage
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.760]   in order to get to that next rung on the ladder
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.240]   and just kind of figured it out
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   in a backcasting kind of way as you refer to it.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.920]   I think this is incredibly useful
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.340]   because it puts all the questions about blood work
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.440]   and how often to get blood work
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.080]   and what to measure in a really nice context
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.680]   that's highly individualized.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.960]   I've never heard of this before, so.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.740]   - And I should give a nod to Annie Duke.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.800]   I used to always refer to this as reverse engineering,
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.200]   but in Annie Duke's book,
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.760]   she wrote about this exact thing and called it backcasting.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.320]   And I was like, I like the term backcasting better.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.480]   I think it's more intuitive than reverse engineering.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.960]   - Yeah, there's a real genius to it.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.000]   And I think it, 'cause it sets so many things
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.800]   into the appropriate bins and trajectories.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.940]   I've heard you talk before about some of the prime movers
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:38.420]   for longevity and all risk mortality.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.260]   And I'd love for you to review a little bit of that for us.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.060]   I think we all know that we shouldn't smoke
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.540]   because it's very likely that we'll die earlier
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.500]   if we smoke nicotine.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.980]   I'm neither a marijuana nor a nicotine smoker,
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.920]   so I feel unstable ground there.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.780]   But anytime we see smoking nowadays,
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.400]   people really want to distinguish
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.880]   between cannabis and nicotine.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.900]   So I am curious about any differences there
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.220]   in terms of impact on longevity.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.400]   But in that context,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.960]   what are the things that anyone and everyone can do,
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.800]   should do to live longer, basically?
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.760]   - How long you got?
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.960]   - Well, you tell me.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.160]   (laughing)
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.560]   You tell me.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.660]   I'd like to live to be,
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.400]   I'd like my final decade to be between 90 and 100.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.120]   - Oh no, I meant how long do you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.960]   - I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.460]   - And will we spend from now until you're 90
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.300]   talking about this?
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.240]   - Well, there's a risk of that.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.960]   But top contour is fine.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.440]   I know you've done a lot of content on this
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.760]   and we will give people links
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.640]   to some of that more in-depth content.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.360]   But let's say we were on a short flight
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.240]   from here to San Diego.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.260]   We're in Los Angeles now.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.940]   And we got takeoff and landing
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.640]   and we don't want to kink our neck too much
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.480]   by doing this thing.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.960]   So if I just said, hey,
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.340]   give me the extended version of the three by five card.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.540]   What does that look like?
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.840]   - So let's start with a couple of the things
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.680]   that you've already highlighted.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.460]   So smoking, how much does smoking increase your risk
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.840]   of all-cause mortality?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.180]   And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.480]   or all-cause mortality is it's really agnostic
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.820]   to how you die.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.700]   And that doesn't always make sense.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.040]   I mean, if you're talking about a very specific intervention
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.800]   like a anti-cancer therapeutic,
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   you really care about cancer specific mortality
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.880]   or heart specific mortality.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.460]   But when we talk about these sort of broad things,
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.840]   we like to talk about ACM.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.520]   So using smoking, smoking is approximately a 40% increase
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.280]   in the risk of ACM.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.540]   - What does that translate to?
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.040]   And that means I'm shortening my life by 40%.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.680]   - No, it means at any point in time,
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.720]   there's a 40% greater risk that you're gonna die
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.040]   relative to a non-smoker and a never smoker.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.440]   Yeah, so it's important to distinguish.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.120]   It doesn't mean your lifespan is gonna be 40% less.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.720]   It means at any point in time standing there,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.560]   your risk of death is 40% higher.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.340]   And by the way, that'll catch up with you, right?
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.720]   At some point that catches up.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.040]   High blood pressure, it's about a 20 to 25% increase
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.180]   in all cause mortality.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.460]   You take something really extreme
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.220]   like end stage kidney disease.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.520]   So these are patients that are on dialysis
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.220]   waiting for an organ.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.420]   And again, there's a confounder there
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.780]   because what's the underlying condition
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.620]   that leads you to that?
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.780]   It's profound hypertension,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.840]   significant type two diabetes that's been uncontrolled.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.680]   That's enormous.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.060]   That's about 175% increase in ACM.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.560]   So the hazard ratio is like 2.75.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.480]   Type two diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.280]   So a 25% increase.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.720]   So now the question is like, how do you improve?
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.700]   So what are the things that improve those?
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.820]   So now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.660]   and other metrics.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.540]   So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass,
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.840]   what is the improvement?
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.620]   And it's pretty significant, it's about three X.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.560]   So if you compare low muscle mass people
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.800]   to high muscle mass people as they age,
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.120]   the low muscle mass people have about a three X hazard ratio
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.180]   or a 200% increase in all cause mortality.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.320]   Now, if you look at the data more carefully,
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.640]   you realize that it's probably less the muscle mass
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.320]   fully doing that,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.240]   and it's more the high association with strength.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.380]   And when you start to tease out strength,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.300]   you can realize that strength could be
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.660]   probably three and a half X as a hazard ratio,
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:24.220]   meaning about 250% greater risk
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.740]   if you have low strength to high strength.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.240]   - High strength is the ability to move loads
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.440]   at 80 to 90% of one repetition.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.940]   - It's all defined by given studies.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.740]   So the most common things that are used are actually,
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.300]   they're used for the purposes of experiments
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.400]   that make it easy to do.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.160]   I don't even think they're the best metrics.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.360]   So they're usually using like grip strength,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.360]   leg extensions, and like wall sits, squats, things like that.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.020]   So how long can you sit in a squatted position
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.640]   at 90 degrees without support
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.860]   would be a great demonstration of quad strength,
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.080]   a leg extension,
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.900]   how much weight can you hold for how long
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.340]   relative to body weight, things like that.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.980]   We have a whole strength program
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.180]   that we do with our patients.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.260]   We have something called the SMA.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.860]   So it's the strength metrics assessment.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:13.860]   And we put them through 11 tests that are really difficult,
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.980]   like a dead hang is one of them.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.660]   Like how long can you dead hang your body weight,
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.660]   stuff like that.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.860]   So we're trying to be more granular in that insight,
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.340]   but tie it back to these principles.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.340]   If you look at cardio respiratory fitness,
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.900]   it's even more profound.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.660]   So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25%
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.620]   for their age and sex in terms of VO2 max,
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.240]   and you compare them to the people
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.660]   that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile,
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.020]   you're talking about a 2X difference roughly
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.900]   in the risk of ACM.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.060]   If you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%,
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.140]   so you're talking about bottom quarter to the elite
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.820]   for a given age, you're talking about 5X,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.220]   400% difference in all-cause mortality.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.740]   That's probably the single strongest association I've seen
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.900]   for any modifiable behavior.
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.940]   - Incredible, so when you say elite,
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.140]   these are people that are running marathons
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.220]   at a pretty rapid clip?
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.420]   - Not necessarily, it's just like what the VO2 max is
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.820]   for that, like my VO2 max would be in the elite
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.420]   for my age group, my VO2 max.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.580]   But again, I'm training very deliberately
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.660]   to make sure that it's in that.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.840]   So I wouldn't consider myself elite at anything anymore,
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.500]   but I still maintain a VO2 max that is elite for my age.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.280]   - I consider you an elite physician
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.540]   and podcast and guy all around.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:38.540]   But true, but in terms of, okay, so--
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.980]   - But the point is you don't have to be
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.940]   a world-class athlete to be elite here, yeah.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.540]   - Got it, so maybe we could talk a little bit
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.340]   about the specifics around the training
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.740]   to get into the top two tiers there,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.700]   because it seems that those are enormous positive effects
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.580]   of cardiovascular exercise,
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.280]   far greater than the sorts of numbers that I see around,
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.220]   let's just say supplement A or supplement B.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.560]   - Well, and that's, you know,
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.900]   like this is my whole pet peeve in life, right?
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.660]   It's like, I just can't get enough of the machinating
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.400]   and arguing about this supplement versus that supplement.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.260]   And I feel like you shouldn't be having those arguments
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.460]   until you have your exercise house in order.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.020]   You know, you shouldn't be arguing about your,
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.020]   this nuance of your carnivore diet
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.940]   versus this nuance of your paleo diet
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.380]   versus this nuance of your vegan diet,
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.820]   like until you can deadlift your body weight for 10 reps.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.660]   Like then you can come and talk about those things
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.240]   or something like, let's just go up with some metrics.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.700]   Like until your VO2 max is at least at the 75th percentile
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.260]   and you're able to dead hang for at least a minute
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.120]   and you're able to wall sit for at least two,
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.260]   like we could rattle off a bunch
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.720]   of relatively low hanging fruit.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.800]   I wish there was a rule that said
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.460]   like you couldn't talk about anything else, health related.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.820]   - We can make that rule.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.820]   - No one will listen to it.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.660]   - I don't know about that.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.780]   We can make whatever rules we want.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.580]   We can call it Atiyah's rule.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.120]   One thing I've done before in this podcast
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.980]   and on social media is just borrowing
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.220]   from the tradition in science,
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.060]   which is it's inappropriate to name something
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.780]   after yourself unless you were a scientist before 1950.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.300]   But it's totally appropriate to name things
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.140]   after other people's.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.460]   I'm going to call it Atiyah's rule
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.320]   until you can do the following things.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.160]   Don't talk about supplements.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.620]   - Please refrain from talking about supplements
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.460]   and nutrition.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.280]   - There it is.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.980]   Hereafter, thought of, referred to,
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.300]   and referenced as Atiyah's rule.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.600]   I coined the phrase, not him.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.980]   So there's no ego involved, but it is now Atiyah's rule.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.120]   Watch out, hashtag Atiyah's rule.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.320]   - Oh God.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.340]   - Wikipedia entered Atiyah's rule.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.240]   In all seriousness, and I am serious about that,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.820]   dead hang for about a minute.
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.420]   Seems like a really good goal for a lot of people,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.260]   at least.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.080]   - That's our goal.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.860]   I think we have a minute and a half is the goal
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.980]   for a 40-year-old woman.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.780]   Two minutes is the goal for a 40-year-old man.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:51.420]   So we adjust them up and down based on age and gender.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.260]   - Great.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.820]   And then the wall sit, what are some numbers?
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.660]   - We don't use a wall sit.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.780]   We do just a straight squat, air squat, at 90 degrees.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.020]   And I believe two minutes is the standard
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.620]   for both men and women at 40.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.460]   - Great.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.100]   And then, because for some people,
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.340]   thinking in terms of EO2 max is a little more complicated.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.740]   They might not have access to the equipment
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.540]   or to measure it, et cetera.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.520]   What can we think about in terms of cardiovascular?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.160]   So run a mile at seven minutes or less,
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.000]   eight minutes or less?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.840]   - That's a good question.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.620]   So there are really good VO2 max estimators online,
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.160]   and you can plug in your activity du jour,
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.300]   so be it a bike, run, or rowing machine,
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.400]   and it can give you a sense of that.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.420]   And I used to know all of those,
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.260]   but now that I just actually do the testing,
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:37.620]   I don't recall them.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.360]   But it's exactly that line of thinking,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.240]   like, can you run a mile in this time if you can?
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.160]   Your VO2 max is approximately this.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.000]   - Great.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.400]   - And I think somewhere in my podcast realm,
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.700]   I've got all those charts posted of like,
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.160]   this is by age, by sex.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.960]   This is what the VO2 max is in each of those buckets.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.040]   - Terrific. We'll provide links to those.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.840]   We'll have our people find those links.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.640]   And then you mentioned deadlifting body weight 10 times.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.880]   - I just made that one up.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.280]   That's not one that we include, but something else.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.960]   Something like that.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.420]   - We use farmer carries.
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.200]   So we'll say for a male,
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.480]   you should be able to farmer carry your body weight for,
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.280]   I think we have two minutes.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.920]   So that's half your body weight in each hand.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.860]   You should be able to walk with that for two minutes.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.240]   For women, I think we're doing 75% of body weight
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.440]   or something like that, yeah.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.500]   - Great. I love it.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.880]   As indirect measures of how healthy we are
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.920]   and how long we're going to live.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.380]   - It's basically grip strength, it's mobility.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.080]   I mean, again, walking with that much weight
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.280]   for some people initially is really hard.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.960]   We use different things like vertical jump,
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   ground contact time.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.640]   If you're jumping off a box, things like that.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.820]   So it's really trying to capture,
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.040]   and it's an evolution, right?
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.160]   I think the test is going to get only more and more involved
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.840]   as we get involved.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.440]   'Cause it took us about a year.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.720]   Beth Lewis did the majority of the work to develop this.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.920]   Beth runs our strength and stability program
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   in the practice.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.680]   And basically I just tasked her with like,
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.140]   hey, go out to the literature and come up with
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.520]   all of the best movements that we think are proxies
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.820]   for what you need to be like the most kick-ass,
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.540]   you know, what we call centenarian decathlete,
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.460]   which is the person living in their marginal decade
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.640]   at the best.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.120]   - Well, what I'm about to say is certainly
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.080]   a mechanistic leap, but if you look at the literature
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.280]   on exercise-related neurogenesis in mice
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.880]   or brain atrophy or brain hypertrophy, et cetera,
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.340]   in animal models, it's very clear that the best way
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.220]   to get a nervous system to atrophy,
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.200]   to lose neurons, shrink neurons or lose connections
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.080]   between neurons is to stop that animal from moving
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.600]   or to de-enrich its environment,
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.480]   deprive it of some sensory input or multiple sensory inputs.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.920]   And the best way to enhance the size of neurons,
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.120]   the number of connections between neurons,
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.400]   and maybe even the number of neurons
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.240]   is to enrich its environment and get it moving
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.840]   while enriching that environment.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.200]   - You know, Andrew, I think it's very difficult for me
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.880]   to say that the same is not true in humans.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.160]   And so the first time this became clear to me was in 2014.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.460]   I had an analyst, Dan Pelichar, and I said,
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.340]   "Dan, I'm gonna give you a project
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.180]   "that is vexing me to no end, which is,
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:17.580]   "I want you to look at all of the literature that we have,
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.180]   "both mechanistic and clinical trial data
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:24.460]   "that talks about Alzheimer's prevention.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.940]   "And I wanna know every single type of input,
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.380]   "and I wanna have a clear sense of via what mechanism
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.860]   "does it offer, what mode of protection?"
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.980]   And it took Dan, and this was obviously,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.380]   we iterated a lot on this together,
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:42.940]   and he came back with kind of an amazing presentation
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.900]   that took, I don't know, nine months to a year of work.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.540]   And what amazed me was when he came back to it,
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.800]   he said, "The single greatest efficacy
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.940]   "we can point to is exercise."
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.460]   And I was like, "Dan, that's gotta be nonsense, dude.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.220]   "There's no way exercise is the single best thing
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.240]   "you can do for the brain.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.400]   "There has to be some drug you've missed.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.380]   "There has to be some other thing that you've missed."
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.920]   And he's like, "No, this is hands down the best thing,
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.580]   "'cause it's not just what it's doing to BDNF,
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.980]   "it's not just what it's doing to vascular endothelium,
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.640]   "it's not just what it's doing to glucose disposal
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.120]   "and insulin signaling, all these things.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:22.240]   "It's just touching every aspect of the brain."
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.500]   And I was very skeptical for about six months,
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.800]   kind of really pushed on him, and I was like,
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.060]   "I think you're missing something, Dan,
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.320]   "I think you're missing something."
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.480]   And then finally in the end, looped in Richard Isaacson,
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.360]   who's a neurologist that we work with really closely
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.100]   on Alzheimer's prevention, and ultimately it turned
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:40.120]   into a paper that we wrote, basically, about this topic,
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.380]   and a few others, 'cause again, I thought,
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.520]   "Oh, are you sure it's not EPA and DHA?
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.000]   "That's gotta have a bigger impact."
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.020]   And again, there are a lot of things that I think do matter,
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.780]   and there's a whole host of things that we do
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.480]   for Alzheimer's prevention,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.980]   but I think you're absolutely right.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.980]   There's not one thing that I'll tell patients
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.240]   is more important than exercising.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.920]   And by the way, it's not the sort of pathetic
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.400]   recommendations that are made.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.200]   You have to exercise a lot more
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.720]   if you wanna get this maximum benefit.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.400]   You will get, the maximum benefit comes
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.120]   going from nothing to something.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.800]   So if you go from being completely sedentary
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.000]   to doing 15 met hours per week,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.440]   you'll get probably a 50% reduction in risk.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.160]   So a met hour, a met, just for people who don't know,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.560]   is a metabolic equivalent.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.920]   So we're exerting about 1.3 mets sitting here talking.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.180]   If we were sitting here being quiet,
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.080]   it would be about one met.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.840]   You know, walking really briskly would be about five mets.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.720]   So 15 met hours per week would be three
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.520]   one-hour really brisk walks.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.440]   That's not a lot of work.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.600]   But just going from doing nothing to doing that
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.320]   would give you 50% of the benefit
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.040]   that you would get from going all the way.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.920]   Now again, I think, I'm personally a little skeptical
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.380]   of how much that's, I think it's probably
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.220]   a bit less than that.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.720]   I think there's more upside than people appreciate.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.160]   But the studies I don't think can truly capture that.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.260]   But look, you know, there's no reason
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.160]   to not be exercising more than that
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.760]   and capture more benefit, even though the rate
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.600]   at which you accrue it is less.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.760]   And it also speaks to the healthspan side of this,
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.840]   which is not necessarily captured in those data.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.600]   The healthspan gets back to the functional piece
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.880]   we opened with, which is what do you want to be doing
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.920]   in your marginal decade?
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.840]   Do you want to be able to pick up a great-grandkid
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.160]   if they come running at you?
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.880]   Do you want to be able to get up off the floor?
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.520]   Do you want to be able to play on the floor with a kid
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.780]   and then get up on your own?
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.200]   - Yeah, and I think most people are thinking
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.480]   final years of life, they're trying to think,
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.080]   how can they take themselves to the bathroom?
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.040]   They're thinking how can they sit up off the toilet?
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.880]   I mean, you've got really basic,
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.760]   vegetative-type functions, right, at some level.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.280]   I love this, again, this idea of marginal decade
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.680]   and using that as a way to backcast
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   to actual methods and behaviors and protocols
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.200]   that one should be doing on a daily basis.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:05.160]   I'll use ANIC data, as it's now called,
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.280]   to cite just, I know, three Nobel Prize winners,
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.520]   which doesn't mean anything
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.800]   except that they did beautiful work,
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.880]   but the point is that they're all in their 90s,
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.800]   so I'll name them 'cause I'm complimenting them
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.640]   for what they've done, not just their work,
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.620]   but what I'm about to describe.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.300]   So Eric Kandel at Columbia.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.380]   Nobel Prize-winning for work on memory.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.380]   Torrance and Wiesel, who work on neuroplasticity,
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.620]   and then Richard Axel, who's also at Columbia,
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:30.420]   Nobel Prize-winning work for molecular biology
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.420]   of smell and molecular biology generally.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.780]   All three of them still alive.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.140]   Richard's younger compared to the other two.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.500]   All three of them either swim, jog, or play tennis,
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.780]   or racquetball, I think is Richard's thing,
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.140]   multiple times per week.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:48.860]   Eric was, they're all cognitively still extremely sharp,
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.860]   still interested in the arts, doing science,
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.740]   curious about science, running laboratories,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.240]   writing books, going on podcasts.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.420]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.860]   Again, that's anecdotal, but I was kind of surprised
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.940]   to learn that colleagues that were so intellectually strong
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.980]   were also so obsessed with exercise.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.500]   I mean, they really are obsessed
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.500]   with their exercise routine,
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.960]   and early on linked that to their,
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.780]   some of their intellectual vigor over time.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.700]   I want to just also use it as a jumping off point
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.980]   to ask about one kind of niche thing, but it comes up.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.380]   I don't think I'm going to out which one of those
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.980]   told me this, but one of those three individuals
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.860]   choose an excessive amount of Nicorette.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.340]   Used to be a smoker and I asked him why.
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.060]   And he said, because in his estimation,
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.500]   it's protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:38.500]   or at least the nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.280]   of nicotine, because nicotine is an acetylcholine receptor,
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.440]   obviously, is known to create a state of focus
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.060]   and neural enhancement.
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.720]   What are your thoughts about not smoking?
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.060]   Let's just, I want to be really clear.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.860]   People don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine,
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.680]   it's going to shorten your life.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.840]   Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, in my opinion.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.540]   But what are your thoughts about augmenting acetylcholine
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.780]   through the use of nicotine in order to keep the brain
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.080]   healthy and focused?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.780]   Again, this is one Nobel Prize winner,
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.900]   so it's truly N of one, but he's so convinced
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.900]   that this matches up with the mechanistic data
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.380]   on acetylcholine and cognition
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.220]   that I'd love to get your thoughts on it.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.300]   - So I can't speak to the AD prevention component of it.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.940]   I'd have to run that by a couple of my colleagues
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.240]   who I collaborate with on that.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.420]   But I can definitely speak to the cognitive enhancement
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.380]   piece of it, and I actually did an AMA on this
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.620]   probably a year ago, where I went into all of the gory
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:37.100]   details of it and talked about my own use of nicotine,
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.680]   which I'll cycle on and off.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.380]   I've been doing it for the last 10 years.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.940]   - What form do you take it in?
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.300]   - I used to use the gum.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.320]   I don't like the gum anymore,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:48.140]   so now I like these little lozenges that,
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:51.180]   and I'll tell you a funny story about this.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.460]   So our mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair,
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.700]   mentioned a company to me a year ago.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.120]   He's like, "Hey, have you heard of this company?"
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.440]   And I forget the name of the company,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.920]   but he gave me some name.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.100]   So I go online, and it's like this company
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.020]   selling nicotine, and I'm like,
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.460]   "I wonder why he's asking me to do this."
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.820]   Well, I'll just order a bunch, and then we'll figure out why
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.840]   because we were, you know, there was some reason
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.220]   we were doing this potentially through investment.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.780]   So I get up, literally ordered a lifetime supply
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.600]   of this stuff, and it's pretty good.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.140]   It's actually, it's a really nice little patch,
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.600]   'cause the thing I didn't like about the gum
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.100]   was I hated just the taste of it.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.820]   So then the next week, I'm talking to David,
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.040]   and I'm like, "By the way, I ordered all that
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.400]   "nicotine stuff you told me about."
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.880]   He's like, "What?"
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.860]   And he goes, "Oh, oh, the company's name was something else.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.700]   "It was totally unrelated."
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.380]   I was like, "Oh, God."
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:47.480]   So the short answer is I think this stuff
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:52.140]   is absolutely a concentration-enhancing substance.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.040]   It is addictive, and people need to be wary of that.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.440]   Now, it's not addictive to everybody.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.600]   I personally experience no addiction to it whatsoever.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.280]   So I could do it every day for 30 days
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.420]   and stop and experience no withdrawal.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.420]   I could forget about it.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:09.020]   It doesn't really seem to matter.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.460]   You have to be careful with the dose, truthfully.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.620]   I mean, remember, one cigarette is about
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:18.900]   one milligram of nicotine, and a lot of these lozenges
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:23.420]   will plow four to eight milligrams into you in one shot.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   And for someone who is naive to that like I am,
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.420]   four milligrams is a lot of nicotine in one bolus.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.420]   So you just have to be very mindful of it.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   I got a lot of flak when I did this AMA for obvious reasons,
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.500]   but people were like, how can you, as a doctor,
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.860]   encourage people to use nicotine?
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.920]   And I was like, first of all,
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.160]   I'm not encouraging anybody to use it.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.740]   I just wanna be able to talk about the biochemistry of it.
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.300]   And if disclosing that I use it from time to time
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.820]   is an endorsement, then I apologize for that.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.260]   But on the list of things that you can do
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.100]   to make your brain a little more focused,
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.300]   I would consider this infinitely safer
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.540]   than what a lot of people are doing,
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.340]   which is using stimulants.
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:10.420]   I mean, to me, I just tell patients outright,
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.540]   we are under no circumstance prescribing stimulants.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:16.420]   I mean, we're not giving anybody Adderall.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.020]   We're not giving anybody Vyvanse or any of these things.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.020]   Not to say they don't have an appropriate clinical use,
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.360]   but they should be prescribed into the care
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.380]   of somebody who's really monitoring the use case for it.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.500]   And using that as a tool to enhance concentration
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.340]   and cognitive performance
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.780]   is not something we're comfortable doing.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.460]   - Yeah, it's rampant on college campuses.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:37.780]   - I can only imagine.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:38.980]   - R-modafinil, modafinil,
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.940]   which are slightly different, of course.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.580]   So non-clinical use, not prescribed for ADHD,
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.020]   but just it's rampant.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.380]   Recreational use, study-based use.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.460]   - But the data I've seen on modafinil
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.540]   suggests that it only really provides a nootropic benefit
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.440]   in someone who is deprived of sleep.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:59.340]   Is there data that in a totally well-rested person,
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.420]   there is a nootropic benefit of modafinil?
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.260]   - I don't know.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.020]   I had one experience with R-modafinil
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.220]   where I took half a recommended dose.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.400]   This was prescribed by a doctor.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.820]   I went to give a talk, this is in Hawaii,
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.140]   and four hours into the talk,
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.940]   my co-speaker came up to me and just said,
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:16.780]   "Well, first of all,
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.760]   you got a little bit of a spit in the corner of your mouth,
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.820]   and second of all, you haven't blinked in three minutes."
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.900]   And third, there's only two people left in the audience.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.820]   I was so lasered in that I kind of forgot the context.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.340]   I'm a little bit of a kind of a tunnel vision OCD type.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.580]   Anyway, but that was all it took.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.120]   I never took any more of it.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.220]   It was a powerful stimulant.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.340]   I take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC now and again
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.860]   before some cognitive work, sometimes before workouts.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:47.260]   And I do subjectively feel that it narrows my focus
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.100]   in a nice way,
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.540]   but I don't take it more than once or twice a day
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.140]   and more than once or twice a week.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.880]   - So this is an example of where,
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.300]   you know how we're talking about exercise
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.020]   versus sort of nutrition and supplements for longevity?
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.580]   - I think there may be a whole bunch of things
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.620]   that are kind of interesting around focus,
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.200]   but nothing would compare to changing our environment.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.540]   Like I think that if I compare my focus today
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.700]   to my focus when I was in college, there's no comparison.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.120]   Like in college, I was truly a robot,
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.400]   but I think a large part of it was there was no distraction.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.900]   There was no email, there was no social media,
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:22.860]   there was no internet.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.800]   I mean, I was in college when Mosaic launched
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.880]   in the early '90s, and you had to walk like a mile
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.580]   to get to the computer lab on a big sun workstation
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:36.380]   to do anything in some computer code language.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.940]   So when you're sitting in your room studying,
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.300]   there was no distraction.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.720]   And I think that's a far greater component
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.500]   of what it means to be focused
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.600]   than the challenges we have today.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.400]   So my thoughts on this would be,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.140]   if we really wanted to return to a state of focus,
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.560]   we're gonna have to individually do something
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.200]   about our environment.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.620]   And I don't know what the answer is.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:00.960]   I've tried every little trick I can think of,
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.600]   like closing my browsers when I'm writing and stuff,
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.720]   but I'm just not strong enough willed.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.040]   Like I'll pick up my phone every 20 minutes
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.800]   to look and see if I miss the text message
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.880]   or something stupid.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.100]   - That's pretty infrequent.
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.600]   I did a episode on habits and looking at the data.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.040]   It seems that people are getting interrupted
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.580]   or interrupting themselves about once every three minutes
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.240]   in the typical workplace, now that typical has changed
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.100]   with a lot more people working at home.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.040]   - I do put my phone away when I try and work,
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.680]   that nothing focuses me like a deadline,
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.160]   a little bit of a fear-based urgency.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.840]   That's it, grant deadlines, drop deadlines, as I call them,
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.720]   or podcasts we're gonna record today,
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.940]   that nothing works quite like it, but such is life.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.000]   Well, thanks for that offshoot about nicotine.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.440]   Again, you're not recommending it.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.400]   I'm not recommending it,
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.320]   but it's clear that augmenting the acetylcholine system,
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.100]   which is what nicotine does in its various forms
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.760]   and some related type pharmacology,
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.800]   does enhance focus and pretty potently.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.260]   So I think it's gonna be an interesting area
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.320]   for real clinical trials and things of that sort.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.920]   Love to chat about hormone therapies and hormones generally.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.980]   When Robert Sapolsky came on the podcast,
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.020]   we talked a little bit about menopause
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.040]   and the data around menopause.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.600]   He's very interested in these findings that,
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.140]   I think I'm gonna get this right,
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.920]   that whether or not women benefit from estrogen therapy
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.620]   to offset menopause really depends
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.900]   on when that therapy is initiated.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.240]   I don't know if you're aware of those data,
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.680]   but he claimed that if they begin estrogen therapy
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.040]   in the middle to tail end of menopause,
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.040]   the outcomes can be quite bad,
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.740]   whereas if they initiate those estrogen therapies
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.600]   as they enter menopause or even before menopause,
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   then the outcomes can be quite good.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.580]   I don't know what percentage of the patients you treat
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.780]   are male versus female
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.860]   and what ages those patients are, of course,
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.560]   but what are your thoughts about estrogen therapy
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.600]   for women, menopause, and hormone therapies
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.520]   generally for women, maybe even testosterone therapy.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.560]   You hear about that these days.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.860]   And then we'll talk about men.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:10.760]   - So our practice is probably 70, 30 male, female.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.480]   So we have lots of women,
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.160]   and this is a very important topic.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.280]   It's also probably, let me think.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.920]   I just want to make sure I'm not being hyperbolic
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.820]   when I say this.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.060]   Yeah, I don't think I am.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.280]   It's hands down the biggest screw up
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.380]   of the entire medical field in the last 25 years.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.200]   Now again, it's possible in the next hour,
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.840]   I'll think of, there's a bigger screw up.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.680]   - Another giant screw up.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.360]   - Yeah, but I don't think I will.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.240]   I'm pretty confident that I won't be able to think
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   of a bigger act of incompetence
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.560]   than what happened with the Women's Health Initiative
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.880]   in the late '90s and early 2000s,
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.800]   which is effectively the study
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.240]   that turned the entire medical field
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.880]   off hormone replacement therapy for women.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.300]   So it's important, I think,
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.360]   to explain what the study looked at.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.080]   So this was a study that was conducted in response
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.080]   to the widely held belief in the '70s and '80s
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.000]   that women should be placed on hormones
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.560]   as they're going through menopause, right?
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.480]   Menopause is, I guess maybe I'll even take a step back.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.840]   I don't know how much your audience is familiar
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.360]   with how estrogen progesterone work.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.840]   Is it worth going into that stuff?
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.680]   - Yeah, probably worth mentioning
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.080]   a bit of the top contour.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.400]   Some of them might be familiar with it.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.120]   We've done episodes on estrogen, testosterone,
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.080]   but frankly, as I think back to those,
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.360]   we didn't really go into the biology
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.180]   of estrogen, testosterone, you know.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.360]   - Yeah, so, I mean, actually an interesting aside
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.800]   that I always tell my female patients
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.200]   who get a kick out of this.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.800]   When you look at a woman's labs,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.240]   you'll see her estrogen, her progesterone,
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.900]   her FSH, her LH, her testosterone,
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.840]   her sex hormone binding globulin, all these things.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.320]   But based on the units they're reported in,
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.440]   it's a very distorting picture
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.920]   of what the most common androgen is in her body.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.960]   If you actually convert them to the same units,
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.760]   she has much more testosterone in her body than estrogen.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.840]   - Interesting. - Yeah.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.000]   - I did not know that.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.480]   Then again, I've never been a woman
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.080]   getting my hormone profile done.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.900]   - Yeah, so even though a woman's testosterone
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.680]   is much less than a man's level,
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.800]   it's still more than she has estrogen in her body.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.280]   So phenotypically, right,
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.600]   estrogen is the hormone that's dominating.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.320]   She has much higher estrogen than a man
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.280]   and much lower testosterone than a man,
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.800]   but in absolute amounts,
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.400]   she has more testosterone than estrogen.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.440]   Just worth pointing that out.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.280]   - Incredible.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.520]   - So, you know, what's happening to a woman
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.080]   from the age she starts menstruating
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.840]   until she goes through menopause,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.220]   outside of pregnancy and birth control and stuff like that,
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.760]   is she has this cycle, you know,
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.000]   roughly every 28 days, but it can vary,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.160]   where at the beginning of her period,
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.600]   we call that day zero,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.040]   her estrogen and progesterone are very low.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.460]   You can't measure them.
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.960]   And then what happens is the estrogen level starts to rise
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.240]   and it rises in response to a hormone
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.840]   called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH,
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.560]   that is getting her ready to ovulate.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.680]   And she ovulates at about the midpoint of her cycle.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.440]   So if we're just gonna make the math easy,
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.080]   on day 14, she's going to release a follicle
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.880]   from one of her ovaries.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.960]   And the estrogen level is sort of rising, rising, rising.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.180]   We love to measure hormones on day five,
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.300]   because I wanna have a standardized way
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.940]   in which I measure her hormones.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.840]   So our women know if we're in the business
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.120]   of trying to understand her hormones,
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.380]   the day her period starts,
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.740]   even if it's just a day of spotting,
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:35.940]   that becomes our benchmark.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.280]   And then day five, I wanna see every hormone on that day.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.060]   And if everything is going well,
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.860]   they know what her FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.380]   should be on that day.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.220]   So the estrogen rises, starts to come down a little bit
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.580]   as she ovulates, and then the luteinizing hormone kicks on
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.740]   because it's now going to prepare her uterus
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:59.180]   for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.460]   So now you start to see estradiol go back,
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.300]   but now for the first time, progesterone goes up.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.420]   So progesterone has been doing nothing for 14 days,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.700]   and now it starts to rise.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.300]   And actually progesterone is the hormone
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.060]   that's dominating the second half,
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.300]   which is called her luteal cycle.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.600]   So the first 14 days is the follicular cycle,
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.540]   second is the luteal cycle.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.060]   So once you get to about the halfway point of that,
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.060]   which is now, just to do the math, 21 days in,
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.380]   the body has figured out if she's pregnant or not.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.780]   And again, most of the time she's not gonna be pregnant,
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.980]   so the body says, oh, I don't need this lining
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:32.260]   that I've been preparing, I'm going to shed it.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:35.860]   So now progesterone and estrogen start crashing,
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.580]   and the lining is what is being shed,
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.740]   and that is the menses.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.620]   By the way, it's that last seven days of that cycle
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.260]   that in a susceptible woman
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:47.260]   is what creates those PMS symptoms.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.700]   So it's the, actually this is something
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:49.580]   that you would probably have
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.340]   a better understanding of than me.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.780]   There is something about this in a susceptible woman
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.080]   where the enormous reduction of progesterone so quickly
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.860]   is probably impacting something in her brain.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.020]   So I think this is a legitimate thing, right?
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.960]   I mean, it's not like, oh, she's crazy
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.320]   because she's having all these PMS symptoms, no.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.440]   We know that that's the case
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.240]   because if you put women on progesterone
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.680]   for those seven days, those symptoms go away.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.640]   So if you can stabilize their progesterone
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.640]   during the last half of their luteal phase,
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.680]   and sometimes we would just do it
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.840]   for the entire luteal phase,
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.100]   just put them on a low dose of progesterone,
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.460]   all PMS symptoms vanish.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.300]   - Very interesting.
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.700]   I'll have to look up where the progesterone receptors
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.540]   are located in the brain.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.240]   The Allen Brain Institute now has beautiful data
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.520]   of in situ hyperization,
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.600]   which for folks that don't understand is looking at RNA
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.680]   and sort of where genes and proteins ought to be expressed
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.040]   in the human brain by using actual human brain tissue
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.320]   sections as opposed to just mice.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.140]   So I'll take a look.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.160]   I think some insight into what that
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.320]   progesterone emotionality link might be
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.920]   and where it might exist neural circuit wise.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.480]   - So then when the estrogen and progesterone
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.500]   reach their nadir again, that starts the cycle.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.100]   So that cycle is happening over and over and over again.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.620]   - Okay, so it became well known in the '50s
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.460]   that okay, a woman's gonna stop menstruating at some point.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.540]   Her estrogen goes down.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.540]   Why don't we just give her estrogen?
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.940]   'Cause that's clearly gonna help
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.460]   with some of the symptoms of menopause.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.100]   So what do women experience when they go through menopause?
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.460]   The first symptoms are what are called vasomotor symptoms.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:25.460]   So this is usually in the form of night sweats, hot flashes.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:26.980]   So, and depending on the woman,
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.680]   this can be really significant, right?
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.740]   These are women who can have a hard time sleeping.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.540]   They can be having hot flashes during the middle of the day.
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.980]   They can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:40.660]   Those tend to pass after a couple of years
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.120]   and then they get into sort of the more
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.300]   long-term complications of menopause.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.680]   So what we call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness,
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.780]   and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago,
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.140]   which is the osteopenia, osteoporosis.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.700]   A lot of women will complain of brain fog.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.780]   So, I mean, clearly this was an issue
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.720]   and it was recognized 70 years ago.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.780]   Why don't we give women estrogen back
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.840]   to replace that hormone?
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.220]   And so that went on for a couple of decades,
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.380]   maybe less, maybe a decade, and then it was realized,
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.920]   wait a minute, we were driving up the risk of uterine cancer.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.420]   And the reason for that is if you just give estrogen
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.700]   with no progesterone to antagonize it,
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.980]   you will thicken the endometrium endlessly
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.220]   and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia.
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.140]   Well, you'll definitely undergo hyperplasia
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.580]   and then ultimately dysplasia.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.740]   Dysplasia is precancerous and ultimately we were seeing that.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.120]   So people figured out, well, actually,
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.420]   if you want to give estrogen to a woman
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.460]   who still has her uterus,
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.520]   you have to give her progesterone as well.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.340]   You have to be able to have a hormone
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.900]   to oppose the estrogen.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:53.580]   And then that became effectively in the 19,
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.860]   call it the 1970s-ish, the standard for HRT.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:04.540]   So in the early 1990s, the NIH said,
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.820]   look, we haven't really studied this.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.400]   We have a ton of epidemiology that says
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.100]   giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.700]   They feel better, so all their symptoms go away.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.140]   They seem to have lower risk of heart disease,
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.720]   lower risk of cardiovascular disease,
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.460]   lower risk of bone fractures.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.360]   Everything seems to get better, lower risk of diabetes.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.560]   But we haven't tested this
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.540]   in a randomized prospective trial, so let's do this.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.500]   So that became the WHI.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.180]   And it randomized, it had two parallel arms.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:44.180]   So it had a group for women who did not have a uterus.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.140]   So these are women that had undergone hysterectomy
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.060]   for some other reason.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.500]   And then it had a group for women
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.060]   that did have their uterus.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:53.220]   In the first group, there was a placebo arm,
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.200]   and then an estrogen-only arm.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.220]   And in the other group, there was a progesterone
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.620]   plus estrogen versus a placebo.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:04.460]   Everything about the way this study was done
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.380]   is a bit wonky.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.860]   Some of it is justifiable,
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.820]   but it's important to understand.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:13.380]   First, the women were all way outside of menopause.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.460]   So none of these women were started
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.420]   when you would normally start HRT.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.040]   And there were probably several reasons for that,
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.860]   but one of them is, and I think this is a legitimate reason,
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.900]   they wanted hard outcomes.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.160]   They wanted to know death rates.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.860]   And if you're doing this on women in their 50s,
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.500]   you just weren't gonna get it, right?
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.760]   You couldn't-- - You gotta wait too long.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.600]   - Yeah, you gotta wait too long.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.300]   And this was only gonna be like a seven to 10-year study.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.200]   So they had to do this on women who were much older.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.100]   They also disproportionately took much sicker women.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.140]   I believe the prevalence, and again,
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.280]   I'm gonna get some of these numbers wrong
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.780]   and people are gonna get all phosphorylated,
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.420]   but I'm in the ballpark, right?
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.260]   Something like 30, 40% of these women were smokers.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.520]   The prevalence of obesity, diabetes was enormous.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.780]   So they really disproportionately picked
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.620]   the most unhealthy population they could
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.420]   that was pretty advanced in age.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.240]   And again, I think part of that was to say,
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.460]   look, we wanna make sure that after seven years,
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.200]   we really know if there's a difference
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.580]   in these causes of death.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:18.920]   The other thing is, this is kinda weird,
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.360]   although again, I understand their rationale for it,
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.100]   but this is a great example of be very careful
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.340]   when you look at a clinical trial
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.420]   that it remotely represents the patients
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.940]   you're interested in treating.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.820]   So they also treated no patients who were symptomatic.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:38.260]   The rationale being, if we include in the study
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.780]   patients who are symptomatic,
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.100]   those who are randomized to placebo will drop out.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:47.460]   - Okay, it makes sense in terms of study design,
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.300]   it makes no sense if the study design
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.160]   is intended to mimic the real world.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.000]   - That's right.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.520]   So now let's just keep track of the three issues.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.200]   We have a disproportionately unhealthy patient population
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.980]   who are not symptomatic, and we're starting them
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.860]   more than 10 years after menopause.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.960]   The next thing that they did,
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.440]   which again, I understand why they did it,
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.640]   but it's now the fourth strike against this study is,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.100]   and I've spoken with the PI of the study
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.740]   and asked this question point blank,
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.540]   I'm actually going to have her on my podcast
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.620]   at some point soon to go over this in more detail,
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.940]   is why did you use conjugated equine estrogen and MPA,
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.300]   which is a synthetic form of progesterone?
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.980]   - Horse estrogen?
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.340]   - It's horse urine, they collect horse urine,
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.660]   so they're getting--
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.000]   - Horses do urinate a lot, or at least when they urinate,
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.580]   it seems like a large volume of urine
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.100]   from what I've observed.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.380]   - You have a lot of experience with this?
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.460]   - No, but my sister rode horses for a little while.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.320]   My high school girlfriend had a horse,
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.520]   and that thing, I mean, the peas were legendary.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.860]   It's a male horse.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.100]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.740]   - So yeah, so the conjugated equine estrogen
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.280]   is the estrogen that's collected from female horses,
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.240]   and then it's a synthetic progesterone.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.900]   And I said to the person, I said,
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.180]   well, why didn't you use what we use today,
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.500]   which is bioidentical estrogen and progesterone?
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.060]   Like today, when we put women on estrogen,
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:18.020]   we use, it's an FDA product called the Vivel Dot,
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.900]   so it's a patch that you just put on,
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.500]   and it's estradiol, but it's bioidentical estradiol,
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.380]   and we use what's called micronized progesterone,
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.580]   so bioidentical progesterone.
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.440]   And she said, well, at the time,
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.580]   we just wanted to test what was currently being used.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.960]   I said, totally makes sense.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.700]   But again, now you have four considerations
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.620]   that you have to keep in mind.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.260]   Okay, so despite those four considerations,
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.460]   and I'm gonna make a case for you
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:45.860]   why I think the MPA created a real problem in that study,
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.900]   the synthetic progesterone.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.900]   When the preliminary results were first made available,
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.740]   but not yet peer reviewed and not yet published,
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:00.740]   there was a huge fiasco, huge press announcement about it,
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.740]   suggesting that the women receiving the CEE plus MPA
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:11.700]   in the group with the uterus had a higher incidence
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.180]   of breast cancer.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.500]   And that basically became the headline that never went away,
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.060]   though it turned out not to be true.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.580]   Let's talk about the numbers.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.780]   What was the increase in the risk of breast cancer
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.620]   in that group, which gets to my, one of my,
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.500]   if you've ever listened to me on the podcast,
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.600]   rail on something.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.020]   - Listen, I have about 3,800 pet peeves and counting.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:35.440]   My laboratory staff know these, know a good number of them,
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.460]   so you do not have to apologize
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.840]   for having many pet peeves,
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.300]   because as long as they have experience and data
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.980]   to support them, it provides a better life.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.540]   - So one of my biggest pet peeves is,
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.020]   and my team knows this,
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.340]   'cause sometimes they'll occasionally, they'll do this
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.620]   and I'll have to remind them.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.860]   You never talk about a relative risk change
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.540]   without an absolute risk accommodating it, right?
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.780]   So what does that look like?
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.320]   So the relative risk increase of breast cancer
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.380]   in the estrogen plus MPA group versus the placebo
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:09.380]   was 25, 27%, and that became the only headline.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:15.400]   HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 27%.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.860]   Now, I don't think that's true at all today,
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.280]   but let's even look at the data.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.960]   What was the ARR?
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.760]   What was the absolute risk increase?
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.500]   It was a difference between five cases per thousand
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.120]   and four cases per thousand.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:36.980]   So the ARR was 0.1%, one case in a thousand.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:41.540]   And it's true, going from four in a thousand
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.620]   to five in a thousand is a 25% increase,
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.340]   but it's a completely inappropriate context.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.900]   - I agree, and I feel like headlines of that sort,
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:52.900]   which have come up recently
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.660]   around various dietary interventions,
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.900]   we won't go there, at least not for the time being,
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.380]   are nothing short of criminal
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.980]   because they really distort people's thinking,
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.180]   but also they steer the course of science and medicine
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.740]   for, as you pointed out, for decades, if not longer,
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.140]   and they can really take us off our health track
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.700]   in serious ways.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.740]   - So I'll bring this meandering to a close,
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.460]   which is to say, even though I could spend the next hour
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.940]   talking about all of the ways
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.800]   in which this study was flawed
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.980]   and all of the very unethical things
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:26.100]   that were done by a number of the investigators
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:30.260]   who went out of their way to mask the truth of this study
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:33.380]   from the world, I'll tell a woman today,
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.980]   we're gonna start you on this
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.420]   when you're going through menopause,
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.500]   we're using bioidentical hormones,
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.900]   and if your upper bound risk of breast cancer
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.580]   is one case in a thousand,
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.900]   you should at least weigh that
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:51.960]   against all of the other benefits, which I'll talk about.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.420]   Now, there's something else I wanna say
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.720]   because a moment ago I alluded to the fact
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.340]   that I think the MPA might have been
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.940]   the biggest issue in that study.
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:01.420]   So there were two findings in that study that were negative.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.920]   One was the small increase in the risk of heart disease
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.740]   and the small increase in the risk of breast cancer.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.860]   But consider the other group.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.600]   We forgot about the group that didn't have a uterus.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.240]   'Cause remember, those women got estrogen only
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.000]   versus placebo.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.780]   What was the difference in breast cancer there?
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.620]   Well, this is interesting
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.100]   'cause it didn't reach statistical significance,
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:27.040]   but its P value was 0.06 or 0.07.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.260]   So it came very close, but it was in the opposite direction.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:35.880]   It was a 24% risk reduction, about one in a thousand as well.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.560]   So when you had estrogen plus MPA,
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.360]   you had a barely statistically significant,
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.860]   the P value was 0.05.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.860]   So it just hit statistical significance,
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.020]   one in a thousand cases for breast cancer.
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.720]   And then you had one in a thousand cases,
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:56.440]   but P value of 0.07 for reduction of risk of breast cancer,
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.280]   which to me suggests that the MPA,
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.880]   the synthetic progesterone,
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.760]   was playing more of a role than anything else.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.120]   The second thing I point out is oral estrogen,
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.520]   which we no longer use, does increase coagulability.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.840]   It does increase the ability of the blood
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.120]   to clot a little bit.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.800]   And when we look at the more recent data on HRT
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.960]   using topical estrogen or patches of estrogen,
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.880]   we don't see that at all.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.020]   In fact, we see the opposite now.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.320]   So now we see the risk of heart disease
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.720]   going down in women with estradiol.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.040]   - And some women will be arriving to those treatments
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.560]   with mutations and things like Factor V Leiden
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.360]   and other clotting factors.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.480]   Is it appropriate to say that everyone,
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.360]   both male and female, should know whether or not
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.920]   they have mutant forms of Factor V Leiden?
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.360]   - You know, we don't typically test people for Factor V.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.060]   My wife actually has it, but we didn't learn it
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.740]   until she had Help Syndrome,
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.320]   giving birth to our first daughter.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.260]   But we kind of look for more family history reason
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.040]   to be testing things like that.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.400]   We take a pretty detailed family history,
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.880]   so we'll kind of look for clotting issues there.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   - What about, so your reflex nowadays is to put women
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.800]   on these topical estrogen therapies?
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.720]   - Well, it's to basically have the discussion, right?
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.720]   So here's where we still struggle, right?
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.500]   Is, you know, we, if it were up to me, I'd prefer
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.820]   for a woman's HRT to be provided by her GYN.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.660]   Because we want to be able to work in partnership
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:24.580]   with the GYN, who we would like to see
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.500]   an endometrial ultrasound done every year.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.380]   That's, you know, some would argue that's overkill,
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.300]   but you know, we think she'd be shoving a pap smear
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.460]   every year as well.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.020]   So if we're looking at the cervix,
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.100]   we want to look at the endometrium,
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.100]   we want to make sure the lining isn't too thick.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.360]   The other thing I should say, Andrew, is today,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.060]   we now realize that not all women can tolerate,
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.780]   pardon me, progesterone.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:45.800]   So you have to be careful.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.580]   So assuming, again, a woman still has her uterus,
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:51.160]   the estrogen solves most of the problems,
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.320]   but then you have to decide,
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.340]   can she tolerate the progesterone?
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.340]   And it needs to be, if given systemically,
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.500]   like 100 to 200 milligrams.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.180]   And for some women, that is a life-saving intervention.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.540]   I mean, they start sleeping better,
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.700]   their hair gets thicker, they feel better.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:07.500]   But for some women, it literally drives them crazy.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.980]   It's probably the reciprocal of what we were seeing
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.060]   in the case of women with PMS.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.260]   So in those situations, we say, great,
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.760]   we're done with oral progesterone.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.320]   We just use a progesterone-coated IUD.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.760]   So then you get the local progesterone in the uterus
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.000]   for protection in the systemic estrogen.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.880]   - Fascinating.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.700]   What about oral contraception in women?
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:36.380]   So the use of estrogen chronically through people's
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.720]   college years or 20s, 30s, maybe even teens, who knows?
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:44.380]   What's known about the long-term effects, if any?
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.220]   - I gotta be honest with you.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.100]   I don't think I know enough to comment on it.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.820]   It's not something that really impacts
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.260]   my patient population.
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:55.300]   At least in what I see, more women are using IUDs
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.340]   for contraception than OCs.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:03.340]   I mean, we use OCs sometimes in women who are premenopausal
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.160]   for symptomatic control, but we'll typically use
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.380]   like a low, low estrogen, so a very low synthetic estrogen,
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.140]   which I don't like using these very much,
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.100]   but if it's the only thing that we can get
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.440]   to control certain symptoms,
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.660]   and we'll use it like half per cycle.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:23.300]   But it's typically not something we're that experienced with.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.660]   - What about testosterone?
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.660]   Because you mentioned that nanogram per mil,
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.060]   when you set everything to the same,
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.860]   I guess it's nanogram per deciliter,
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.060]   is it would be to kind of normalize everything?
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:37.980]   - First picogram per mole, yeah.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.380]   - Right, yeah, and so what Peter was pointing out before
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.640]   is that you look at your charts,
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.980]   and they're all in these different measures,
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.180]   and so when you normalized,
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.660]   testosterone is actually higher than estrogen in women.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.860]   That's a surprise to me.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:53.500]   Do you prescribe testosterone therapy to women ever?
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.700]   - We do sometimes, but I do it with much more caution
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.600]   because I don't have the data, right?
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.300]   So where I'll, what we'll say is,
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.780]   look, I mean, we're now really outside of an area
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:06.620]   where I can point to a lot of data.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.360]   When it comes to estrogen and progesterone,
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.860]   I'll happily go toe-to-toe with anybody
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.180]   who wants to make the case that it's dangerous.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.760]   Similarly, when it comes to using testosterone in men,
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.140]   I'll spend all day, and I can go through that literature
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.860]   until the other person cries
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.300]   and wants to just call uncle, right?
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:25.140]   - When it comes to--
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.020]   - And then you prescribe them testosterone.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.660]   - When it comes to estrogen in,
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:30.500]   oh, testosterone in women, don't have that data.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.820]   And I'd love to see that trial done.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.600]   So what's the sweet spot?
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.140]   How do we reconcile that?
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.860]   So it's not something I consider standard.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.740]   And basically, if a woman is,
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.980]   if her testosterone, first of all, is staggeringly low,
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.700]   and again, even though her testosterone's low
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.780]   compared to a male, we still have a range.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.740]   So if it's really at the bottom of that range,
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.120]   she's really having difficulty putting on muscle mass
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.540]   and really complaining of low libido,
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:56.940]   I think in that situation,
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:59.140]   we'll go ahead and use topical testosterone.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.360]   And replace her to a level
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.860]   that is still physiologically normal.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.100]   - Yeah, that's key, because when people hear HRT,
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.360]   they think about super physiological,
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.260]   seems to be the term.
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:14.120]   - Yeah, like I've never seen a single symptom
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.200]   in a single woman that I've put testosterone on
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.500]   in terms of acne, body hair, things like that.
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.940]   Those are real symptoms that you have to be aware of.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:24.740]   But clitoral enlargement and things like that,
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:28.080]   that doesn't happen under physiologic normal conditions.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:30.360]   - I'd love to talk a little bit
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.040]   about hormone replacement therapy in men.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.260]   When one looks on social media and the internet,
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:40.280]   there seems to be a younger and younger cohort of guys,
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.140]   people in their teens and 20s, showing up to the table,
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.860]   thinking that injecting testosterone,
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.100]   cipunate, or taking Anavar, or whatever it is,
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.580]   is going to be the right idea.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.720]   They mainly seem to be focused on cosmetic effects.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:55.120]   I'm not a physician, so I can't say whether or not
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.860]   they were actually hypogonadal, et cetera,
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:00.000]   but it seems to me, again, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.600]   but it seems to me that similar to the Atiyah's rule,
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.300]   as it relates to longevity,
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:08.460]   that we could come up with a broad contour rule
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:12.500]   in which if a male of any age is not trying
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.620]   to get decent sleep, exercise appropriately,
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.940]   appropriate nutrition, minding their social connections,
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.100]   et cetera, et cetera,
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.980]   the idea of going straight to testosterone
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.420]   seems like a bad idea.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.180]   That said, just like with depression and antidepressants,
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.860]   there is a kind of a cliff
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.020]   after which low enough testosterone
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:35.960]   or low enough serotonin prevents people
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.420]   from sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera.
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.940]   So I do want to acknowledge that.
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:41.700]   But with that in mind,
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:45.620]   how do you think about and perhaps occasionally prescribe
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.740]   and direct your patients
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:50.420]   in terms of hormone replacement therapy in men,
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.060]   person in their 30s, person in their 40s,
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.680]   who's doing almost all the other things correctly?
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.980]   What sorts of levels do you think are meaningful?
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.420]   Because the range is tremendous in terms of blood tests,
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.060]   300 nanograms per deciliter,
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.420]   I think on the low end now in the US,
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.980]   all the way up to 900 or 1200.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.840]   That's an enormous range.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.740]   What are some of the other hormones you like to look at?
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.580]   Estrogen, DHT, and so on.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:15.740]   - So, a lot to unpack there.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.420]   So let's start with the ranges, right?
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:23.420]   So the ranges you gave are for total testosterone, of course.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.920]   And we don't spend a lot of time looking at that.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:31.840]   I used to spend more time looking at total and free
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.980]   when I used more tricks to modulate it.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:37.260]   So I'm actually far more simple
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.080]   in my manipulation of testosterone today
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.180]   than I was six or seven years ago.
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.580]   Six or seven years ago, I mean,
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:48.580]   we would use a micro dose of Anavar to lower SHBG
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:51.020]   in a person who had normal testosterone,
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.460]   but low free testosterone.
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.620]   - What was a low dose of Anavar in that context?
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:00.100]   - 10 milligrams, subling, two to three times a week.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.100]   - Anavar basically being DHT.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.700]   Oxandrolone, oxantrol, and again,
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:06.660]   we're not recommending this.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:08.380]   It's actually, if you're playing a competitive sport,
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:09.940]   can get you banned from that sport.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.100]   It can also get you banned from having children
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.060]   if you do it incorrectly.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:18.180]   - Yeah, so a micro dose of this has to be small enough
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.260]   that it doesn't impair your body's ability
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:24.380]   to make testosterone, but Anavar has such a high affinity
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:28.280]   for SHBG that it basically distracts your SHBG
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.100]   from binding your testosterone.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.100]   - Freeing up testosterone.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:31.940]   - That's exactly right.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.620]   So the goal was how do I just give you more free testosterone?
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.500]   So if a patient shows up and they've got
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.000]   a total testosterone of 900 nanograms per deciliter,
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.580]   which would place them at,
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:42.820]   depending on the scale you look at,
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:46.980]   that would place you at about the 70th percentile,
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.260]   but your free testosterone is, you know,
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.420]   eight nanograms per deciliter.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.260]   So that's pretty bad.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:55.980]   That means you're less than 1% free.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:58.960]   A guy should be about 2% free T.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.840]   So that dude should be closer
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.600]   to 16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter.
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.540]   So in that situation that I just gave you,
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.340]   his SHBG is really high.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.860]   His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.700]   - That's very high.
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:15.220]   'Cause I think the upper range is somewhere around 55, 56.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.540]   - Exactly.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:21.020]   So we would first back stall for what's driving his SHBG.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.700]   So there's basically three hormones.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.340]   So genetics plays a huge role in this.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.340]   There's no question that just out of the box,
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:30.420]   people have a different like set point for SHBG.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.660]   Mine is incredibly low.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.740]   My SHBG is like kind of in the 30s, 20s to 30s.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.320]   But from a hormone perspective,
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.400]   there's basically three hormones that run it.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.920]   So estradiol being probably the most important,
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.620]   insulin and thyroxine.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.400]   So we're gonna look at all of those
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.280]   and decide if any of those are playing a role.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.900]   So insulin suppresses it.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:53.360]   So this is actually the great irony
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.400]   of helping a person get metabolically healthy
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.880]   is in the short run you can actually lower
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.300]   their free testosterone, all things equal.
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.440]   Because as insulin comes down, SHBG goes up.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.160]   And if testosterone hasn't gone up with it,
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.960]   you're lowering free testosterone.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.020]   So somebody who goes on a very low carbohydrate diet
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:12.700]   in an attempt to drop some water and drop some weight
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.440]   is going to increase their SHBG.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.280]   - Yeah, if their insulin goes down-
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.620]   - Bind up testosterone, less free testosterone.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.640]   I can tell the carnivore diet people
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:24.020]   are going to be coming after me with bone marrow in hand.
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.920]   But then again, after this discussion
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.760]   extends a little further,
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.360]   I'm sure the vegans will be coming after me
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.320]   with celery stalks.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.160]   So it's-
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.320]   - So then the same as with estradiol.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.560]   So except in the opposite direction.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.760]   So higher estradiol is higher SHBG.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.600]   So again, occasionally you'll see a guy
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.520]   with normal testosterone,
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.760]   but he's a very high aromatase activity person.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.400]   So he has a lot of the enzyme
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.920]   that converts testosterone into estradiol.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.880]   You can lower estradiol a bit with an aromatase inhibitor,
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.260]   and that can bring down SHBG.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:57.140]   Now again, these things individually
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.840]   are rarely enough to move the needle.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.120]   The last is thyroxine.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.380]   So if you have a person whose thyroid is out of whack,
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.360]   you have to fix that before you,
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.640]   if their T4 is out of whack,
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.160]   you're going to interfere with SHBG.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.220]   There are also some supplements,
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.700]   which I think you've probably talked about these
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.540]   on the podcast.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.060]   I feel like I've heard you talk about these on the podcast.
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.680]   - Yeah, there are a few that will adjust.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.900]   You know, there is this idea.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.640]   Now there's a much better review that just came out.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.480]   I'll send it to you.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.300]   I'd love your thoughts on it.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:24.020]   And I've been perusing it line by line,
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.760]   but I love input from experts like you
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:31.520]   on the use of Tonga Ali for reducing SHBG.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.960]   In my experience, it does free up some testosterone
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.560]   by which mechanism it isn't exactly clear.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.760]   And the effects aren't that dramatic, right?
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.460]   There are probably multiple effects.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.380]   For all we know, it increases libido,
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.660]   and it does generally by way of increasing estrogen slightly
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.700]   which can also increase libido in some individuals.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:51.060]   So we don't know the exact mode of action.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:51.920]   So we've talked about a few.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.120]   The one that a few years back people were claiming
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:58.700]   could reduce SHBG was stinging nettle.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:02.480]   Stinging nettle, well, urinating seems to be coming up
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:05.560]   multiple times on this podcast for whatever reason.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.580]   Stinging nettle extract,
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:09.360]   I took the most pronounced effect of that
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.960]   was you could basically urinate over a car
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.000]   when taking SHBG.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.560]   What the underlying mechanism of that was, I do not know.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.520]   I took it for a short while.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.320]   It didn't drop my SHBG very much,
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.360]   but it did drop by DHT sufficiently
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.040]   so that I stopped taking it.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.060]   I do not like anything that impedes DHT.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.260]   I don't care if my hairline retreats.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.560]   I don't care about any of that.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:36.560]   DHT to me is something to be coveted and held onto
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.460]   because you feel so much better
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.720]   when your DHT is in the appropriate range.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.560]   And I'd love your thoughts on that at some point too.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.520]   - Yeah, again, it really depends on the guy
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.840]   and it depends on what risk you're trying to manage, right?
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.000]   So prostate size starts to become
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.600]   one of the issues with DHT.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.320]   - Luckily, my prostate spastic antigen is low.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.920]   And DHT, the things that I know can reduce it
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.880]   are things like finasteride, Propecia, things like that,
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.600]   right, things that people take to try and avoid hair loss
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.560]   can dramatically reduce DHT
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.060]   and leads to all sorts of terrible sexual side effects,
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.840]   mood-based side effects, et cetera.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.080]   But yeah, so I'm not aware of anything
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.600]   that can be taken in supplement form
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.640]   that can really profoundly drop SHBG.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.920]   - We don't spend much attention on it anymore.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:19.840]   Basically, I used to have a much more complicated
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.640]   differential diagnosis eight years ago.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.440]   Like, I mean, I would drive patients nuts
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.460]   with the whiteboard diagrams I would draw for them
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.640]   and in the end, I think they were just like,
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.900]   "Dude, just what do I need to take?"
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.340]   Today, we take a much more simple approach.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.760]   So the first question is, should you or should you
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.280]   have your free testosterone being higher?
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.780]   That's the metric I care about,
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.880]   is free testosterone is the first most important,
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.440]   the second most important is estradiol.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.800]   - And sorry to interrupt, but you said,
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.280]   if you look at your total testosterone,
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:45.340]   you want the free T to be about 2% of your total.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.180]   - Well, it should be, right?
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:48.360]   Now, I might not change that anymore.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.720]   So in other words, if a guy's at 1%,
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.440]   then I know I have to really boost his total testosterone.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.440]   If he's only gonna get one to one and a half percent
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.840]   of it converted to free, I need to boost him.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.800]   And that's why I don't care if he's outside the range.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.320]   Like, I'll have a guy who's free T,
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.780]   I might have to get a guy's total T up to 1,500
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:06.600]   to get his free T to 18.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.000]   - I see, so free T is the target.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.360]   I like this approach. - Free T is what we treat.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.000]   - And do you still use Anavarix?
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.040]   - I don't use Anavarix. - Los Angeles, sorry,
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.360]   to try and lower SHBG. - I don't, no.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.720]   - Because it's too potent?
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.240]   - No, because it's just too complicated for patients.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.420]   You know, it's a drug that can't be taken orally,
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.840]   so you have to take it under the tongue, right?
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.860]   - Like a troche or something.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.120]   - Right, but I had one patient once who,
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.960]   even though we told him about 87 times that,
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.360]   he was like swallowing the anavars and his liver function,
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.020]   and he was like, we're talking 10 milligrams
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.520]   three times a week is a tiny dose.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.320]   And three months of him, or whatever,
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.640]   two months of him swallowing that every time
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.000]   tripled his liver function test.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.680]   So it's like, I was like, you know what,
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:47.200]   it's just not worth the hassle of doing this
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.240]   for perfection.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.840]   In reality, we can fix this another way.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.320]   So the first order question is,
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.240]   do we believe clinically you will benefit
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.760]   from normalizing your free testosterone,
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.600]   or taking it to a level that's call it
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.340]   80th to 90th percentile?
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:09.240]   So upper normal limit of physiologic ranges.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.040]   That's the first order question.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.640]   And that's going to come down to symptoms,
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.840]   and that's going to come down to some biomarkers.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.320]   I think there's two years ago, was it two years ago,
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.620]   or maybe a year ago, a very good study came out
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:23.960]   that looked at prediabetic men,
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.560]   you've probably talked about this study,
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:29.520]   and looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.720]   with and without testosterone.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.140]   And the evidence was overwhelmingly clear.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:36.600]   Testosterone improves glycemic control.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.960]   Testosterone improves insulin signaling.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.740]   This shouldn't be surprising, by the way,
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.440]   given the role muscles play as a glucose reservoir
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.720]   and a glucose sink.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.700]   So now I include that as one of the things
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:49.300]   that we will consider as a factor for using testosterone.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:50.800]   Now, again, it's not the only one,
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.780]   so you can accomplish that with exercise,
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:53.880]   you can accomplish that with these other things,
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.760]   but then you get into a little bit of the vicious cycle
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.240]   of will having a normalized testosterone
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.800]   facilitate you doing those things better?
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.700]   So let's just assume we come to the decision
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.880]   that this person is a good candidate
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.200]   for testosterone replacement therapy.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.200]   The next question is what's the method
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.020]   we're going to do it?
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:15.460]   Are we going to do it indirectly or directly?
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:19.620]   Now, we used to use a lot of Clomid in our practice.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:22.360]   And have you talked about Clomid on the podcast?
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.740]   - I haven't talked too much about it.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:26.140]   - No, we've talked a little bit about the fact
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.400]   that some people taking things like anastrozole
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.480]   to reduce aromatase activity can potentially run
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.100]   into trouble because they think, oh, well,
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.700]   more testosterone good, lower estrogen bad,
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:40.060]   and then they end up with issues like joint pain,
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:42.840]   memory issues, and severe drops in libido,
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.680]   and I think a lot of the reason why.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.400]   - And even fat accumulation.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.120]   So if estrogen is too low, you can develop adiposity
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.200]   in a way that you wouldn't otherwise.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.200]   There's a great New England Journal paper,
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.320]   it's probably 10 years old now,
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.900]   that looked at, I believe it was five different doses
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:58.000]   of testosterone siponate.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.620]   So these men were chemically castrated
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.160]   and divided into 10 groups.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.240]   It's pretty remarkable.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.440]   - Somebody signed up for this study.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.040]   - Yeah, so you were with and without anastrozole
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.040]   and five doses of testosterone.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.420]   So now you basically had five testosterone levels,
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.360]   plus or minus high or low estradiol.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.100]   And the results were really clear
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.260]   that the higher your testosterone
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:22.880]   and the more your estradiol was in kind of that 30 to 50
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.240]   range, the better you were.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.040]   So if estrogen was too low,
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.120]   even in the presence of high testosterone,
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.760]   the outcomes were less significant.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.880]   - And this is 30 to 50 nanograms per deciliter,
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.700]   not 30 to 50% of one's testosterone.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.540]   Okay, great.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:38.600]   - Okay, so- - But we haven't talked,
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:41.000]   but Clomid is, no, we have not talked a lot about Clomid.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.560]   I'd love to get your thoughts on Clomid.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.160]   - So Clomiphene is a fertility drug.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.720]   It's a synthetic hormone.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.920]   It's actually two drugs, M-Clomiphene
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.860]   and I forget the other one.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:55.860]   And it tells the pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:04.060]   And so the advantage of Clomid is it's oral
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:06.120]   and it's meant to be taken orally.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.580]   So a typical starting dose would be like 50 milligrams
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:10.540]   three times a week.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:15.240]   And if you do that, you'll notice in most men,
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.720]   especially young men, FSH, LH goes up.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.540]   In any man, the FSH and LH go up.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.760]   But if a man still has testicular reserve,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.360]   he'll make lots of testosterone in response to that.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.580]   'Cause that's the first order question
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.140]   we're trying to answer is do you,
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:34.080]   is your failure to make testosterone central or peripheral?
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.160]   - Yeah, and I think just one point out,
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.100]   again, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.560]   but my understanding is that a lot of the drugs
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.480]   that we're talking about, the synthetic compounds,
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.760]   testosterone, estrogen,
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.400]   things related to growth hormone, et cetera,
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:50.180]   were discovered and designed in order to treat and,
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.700]   excuse me, in order to isolate
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.460]   and treat exactly these kinds of syndromes,
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.140]   whether or not it was the hypothalamus, the pituitary,
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:59.700]   or the target tissue, the ovaries, or the testes, correct?
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:00.520]   - Correct, yeah.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.400]   I mean, I think the easiest way to go about doing this
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.620]   is just give the hormone that's missing
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.660]   without attention to where the deficiency is.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:12.220]   Why this becomes relevant is if you have a 35-year-old guy
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.540]   whose testosterone is low,
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.600]   but you can demonstrate that it's low
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.500]   because he's not getting enough of a signal
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.820]   from the pituitary,
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.040]   why would you bother giving him more testosterone
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.100]   when he has the, he has the Leydig cells
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:25.780]   and the Sertuli cells to make testosterone.
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:27.020]   He just needs the signal.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.780]   Sometimes, though not always,
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:32.820]   just a course of Clomid can wake him up,
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:35.180]   and he's back to making normal testosterone.
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:36.780]   - So he'll do this three times a week,
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.980]   50 milligrams three times a week for a short course,
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:40.820]   and then-- - Yeah, we would do that
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:43.100]   for eight to 12 weeks, and then we reevaluate.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.780]   And estrogen and testosterone will increase in parallel.
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:49.060]   - Yes, and again, it depends.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:50.740]   Aromatase activity is dependent
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.240]   on how much body fat you have and genetics.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.100]   And if estradiol gets too high,
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:58.660]   we think if it gets over about 55, 60,
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.420]   we will give microdoses of an astrozole.
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.180]   But it has to be real microdoses.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:05.660]   I mean, you cannot pound people with an astrozole.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:10.540]   To give you perspective, the sort of on-label use,
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:13.020]   like if you just go to a pharmacy and order an astrozole,
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.180]   you're going to get one milligram tablets.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.860]   Like we can't give anybody a milligram.
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:18.180]   - They'll feel like garbage.
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:21.060]   - We have to have it compounded at 0.1 milligrams,
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.100]   and we might give a patient 0.1 two to three times a week.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.720]   That would be a big dose of an astrozole.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.140]   - Yeah, I think that the typical TRT clinic out there
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:34.160]   is giving 200 milligrams per mil, one mil,
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:36.280]   200 milligrams of testosterone once every two weeks,
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.780]   and then hitting people with multiple milligrams
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.300]   of an astrozole, and they're all over the place.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.700]   I've never really understood.
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.340]   I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised,
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.820]   but it kind of blows my mind that these TRT clinics
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.580]   are up all over the place, given how bad.
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.820]   I mean, I see the results,
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:53.440]   'cause I have patients that come from them,
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.300]   and I don't understand like why they're so incompetent.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:57.800]   - I actually think it's worse than that.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.220]   I think that they simply don't understand and don't care,
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.860]   because it's a pill mill and it's a money mill.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:07.180]   I think that nowadays it seems almost everybody
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:09.820]   who's doing TRT is taking lower doses more frequently
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.260]   every other day or twice a week, dividing the dose,
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:13.620]   and being very, very careful
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:16.100]   with these estrogen or aromatase blockers.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:20.180]   - Most of our patients do not take aromatase inhibitors.
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:21.020]   It's not needed.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.740]   It's really only the high aromatizers that need it.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:27.260]   And so, yeah, when we'll talk about testosterone,
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:28.860]   we'll talk about dosing there, 'cause I agree,
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.580]   the more frequently you can take it, the better.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.860]   And frankly, you don't need to go more frequently
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.380]   than twice a week.
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.660]   - Because it's so slow-acting.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.260]   - Yeah, the half-life of the drug is,
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.540]   I think it's about three and a half days,
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.900]   is the plasma half-life or something like that.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.260]   It could be off a little bit,
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.980]   but twice-week dosing is really nice.
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:49.340]   So if you go to a testosterone clinic
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:51.460]   that's giving you 200 every two weeks,
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:54.480]   50 twice a week is the same total dose,
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.200]   which, by the way, is a physiologic dose.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.620]   That's not going to give somebody
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:42:59.940]   any of the side effects you would see.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.520]   You're not gonna get acne with that.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.540]   You're not gonna get gynecomastia.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:04.460]   You're not gonna get any things.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.180]   The only real side effect you get from that
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.300]   is you will get testicular atrophy.
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.740]   That is enough to suppress.
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.080]   - Yeah, to maintain fertility,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.580]   what do you typically do for--
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:14.740]   - Well, so this is where,
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.300]   so I'll finish the story on Clomid,
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.140]   'cause we currently do not use Clomid,
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:22.420]   and that's due to a really interesting observation
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:25.820]   that we made that I don't think has been reported
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:27.260]   in the literature yet,
[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:31.420]   which is that Clomid was increasing levels of a sterol
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.500]   that we also happen to measure called desmosterol.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.000]   - I'm not familiar with that.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.540]   - So in the way that cholesterol is made,
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:43.340]   it's made by, there's two pathways that make cholesterol.
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:46.420]   So it starts with two carbon subunits, like acetyl-CoA,
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:49.120]   and it kind of marches down a pathway, bifurcates,
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.540]   and cholesterol is the finished product of both,
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.700]   but in one of those pathways,
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:58.420]   the molecule right before cholesterol is called desmosterol,
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:00.660]   and the other pathway, it's called lathosterol.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:04.740]   So we constantly measure lathosterol and desmosterol
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.740]   because we want to know how much cholesterol
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.540]   is being synthesized in the body,
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.780]   not just what your cholesterol is.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:13.760]   We want to know how much cholesterol you reabsorb,
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.600]   and those markers are really important to us
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.140]   when we're looking at cardiovascular disease risk.
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:22.300]   So when we gave patients Clomid,
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.840]   we were noticing a almost universal rise
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.760]   in their desmosterol levels.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.840]   Now, the most obvious explanation for that,
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.740]   though the last time I looked,
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.980]   I couldn't find clear explanation for this
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:38.580]   in any of the clinical trials
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:40.240]   that led to the approval of Clomid,
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.700]   so I don't know if it was described.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.340]   In fact, maybe it wasn't known.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.100]   I suspect it is inhibiting the enzyme,
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:48.520]   which I think is called Delta-24 desaturase
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:51.500]   that turns desmosterol into cholesterol.
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.180]   Makes sense if you inhibit that enzyme,
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:55.560]   you're gonna see a rise in desmosterol.
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.420]   This wouldn't have been a concern to me
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:00.160]   if not for the fact that Tom Dayspring,
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.420]   who's one of the physicians we work with,
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:02.880]   who's one of the world's experts in lipids,
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.240]   pointed out a very obscure story,
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.760]   which was that the very first drug ever approved
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.560]   to treat cardiovascular disease,
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.840]   at least to treat hypercholesterolemia,
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.460]   was a drug that attacked the same enzyme.
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:21.740]   So this was in the early 1960s, I believe,
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:22.580]   maybe the mid-60s.
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:26.520]   This drug was approved and it lowered cholesterol,
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.800]   and it was approved on the basis of lowering cholesterol.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:32.140]   Now, today, no drug for ASCVD is approved
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:34.140]   on the basis of it lowering cholesterol.
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:35.420]   That's not a high enough bar.
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.980]   You have to reduce events.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:37.820]   They actually have to show
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.740]   that you're preventing heart attacks and death.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:41.660]   But at the time, it was like,
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.700]   "Hey, it lowers cholesterol, it's gotta be good."
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.860]   Well, in the late 60s, it was pulled from the market
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.860]   because events were going up.
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:50.780]   So cholesterol was coming down, events were going up.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.460]   How could that be?
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:53.600]   We don't know.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.180]   What we are suspecting is that desmosterol,
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.280]   which is still a sterol,
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.900]   was potentially more damaging
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.940]   and created more oxidative stress in the endothelium,
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.580]   in the sub-endothelial space, than cholesterol,
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.840]   which would at least suggest to us,
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:13.020]   and again, we're taking a lot of leaps here,
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:15.140]   that maybe having high desmosterol,
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.440]   very high desmosterol, is not a good thing.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.980]   And so once we kind of pieced all that together
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:22.360]   a few years ago, we were like,
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.820]   "Yeah, we're just not gonna prescribe Clomid anymore."
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:30.720]   And we then switched to HCG,
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:33.320]   which we used to use sometimes instead of Clomid,
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.100]   but it's more cumbersome to work with.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.280]   It needs to be refrigerated.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.120]   It's a much more fragile molecule.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.320]   - Yeah, I think we talked about this once.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:42.240]   It's almost like if you accidentally knock over
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.800]   the little bottle, it's basically gone bad.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.280]   Travel with it is very challenging.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.840]   - Can't travel with it.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.320]   It's a needle, it's an injection, sub-Q,
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:52.540]   so easy to administer.
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:53.960]   It's not IM or anything like that,
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.800]   but it's just more of a hassle factor.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:00.120]   But that said, it has the benefit that Clomid does,
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.520]   which is it preserves testicular function,
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.160]   it preserves testicular volume.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.640]   So bodybuilders will often use this
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.500]   in their post-cycle therapy
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.780]   as a way to kind of recover function.
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:15.160]   And we would just use it now as ongoing therapy
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.920]   for a guy who still has testicular reserve.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.680]   - So on its own, no testosterone,
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.520]   no aromatase inhibitor, nothing,
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.880]   just a way to crank out a bit more testosterone
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:26.300]   from the testes, maybe some additional estrogen also.
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:28.140]   - And HCG is a different model.
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.880]   HCG is just an analog of luteinizing hormone.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.280]   So it's basically like giving them luteinizing hormone.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.000]   - So it's going to crush endogenous
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.360]   luteinizing hormone levels, right?
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.200]   Because it's-
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.520]   - Actually, yeah, and you don't really see
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.960]   much of an impact on LH,
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.400]   but you do see endogenous testosterone production go down.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:46.360]   Actually, no, I correct that.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.940]   Both FSH and LH will go down on a high enough dose, yep.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:52.480]   - Just as a mention, and here I'm not making recommendations,
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.560]   but one supplement I've talked a lot about publicly
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.680]   is Fidogia agrestis, which is this weird Nigerian shrub
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.380]   that does- - You talked about this
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.220]   on Tim's podcast.
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.120]   - On Tim's podcast and Joe's podcast.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.600]   And, you know, there was a bit of a backlash
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.960]   because it does turn out that at high doses
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:12.340]   in rodent studies, it can cause some toxicity to the testes.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:14.520]   But at lower doses,
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.600]   it does seem to increase luteinizing hormone.
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:17.520]   And after talking about this,
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.400]   a number of people went out there,
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.640]   did pre and post blood work.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.960]   And the consistent effect seems to be an increase
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.060]   in luteinizing hormone.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:26.680]   There's a noticeable effect on testicular size and volume.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:27.840]   So a lot of people will take this and be like,
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.740]   oh, you know, their balls are getting bigger.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:32.720]   And so they get all excited that something good is happening.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.520]   But we don't know the long-term safety and efficacy
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.680]   of something like Fidogia,
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.880]   whether or not it needs to be cycled.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.040]   - Yeah, this is why I'm also very leery
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.560]   of the supplements in this space,
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:46.080]   because at least when we're using HCG or testosterone,
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.560]   like we have so many years of data.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.080]   You have to remember how many women are using this stuff
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.040]   for reproductive medicine.
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.240]   So, you know, I think the FDA has a lot of faults.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.480]   I think I have an entire podcast devoted
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.280]   to the corruption of the FDA and all of the mistakes
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.720]   that have been made with respect to their oversight
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.740]   in especially generic drugs.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:11.640]   But it's way more regulated than the wild, wild west
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.280]   of nutty supplement land.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.240]   I think that the reason for talking about things
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.140]   like Tonga and Fidogia was to provide
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:21.280]   some intermediate discussion between doing
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.420]   all the correct things, but no supplementation
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.940]   or hormone therapy, and then going straight
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:25.780]   to hormone therapy.
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:28.700]   It's sort of like the leap from I can't focus very well
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:33.320]   to Ritalin, right, without a real diagnosis of ADHD,
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.820]   to, oh, well, maybe some things like alpha-GPC low doses
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:38.020]   of nicotine, right?
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:39.740]   But I agree entirely.
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:41.440]   I mean, the sourcing is important.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:45.680]   The dosages are worked out empirically on an individual basis
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.820]   and there aren't randomized control trials.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:49.260]   There just aren't.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:54.260]   - Yeah, and have kind of like a seven,
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.360]   this is another Peter principle, right?
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.560]   So I've got a lot of patients that come into the practice
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:01.920]   and during our intake, we go through what drugs
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.360]   and supplements are you taking right now?
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360]   And a lot of people come in, I'm not taking anything,
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.320]   Peter, I just, you're in charge now,
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.800]   like, tell me what you think.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:09.980]   And then you get a lot of people that come in
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:12.640]   and they're like, we're gonna need an extra few pages
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:13.480]   for this part of the documentation.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.120]   - Right, the people who travel with a suitcase
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.680]   that you can hear as they walk through the airport
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.380]   from all the pills battling.
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:20.520]   - So I give these patients a little homework exercise,
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.680]   which is you have to answer these seven questions
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.940]   for every supplement you take.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:26.100]   And here's the spreadsheet and let's talk about it.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:28.140]   And it basically just runs through,
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:31.260]   like, you know, it's basically walking you through
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:34.340]   the logic of why do you take this molecule?
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:38.740]   And I think for many people, when they do that,
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:40.340]   it's very sobering, right?
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.220]   They kind of, a lot of them will come back and be like,
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:45.800]   you know what, I don't think I can come up with any reason
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:47.940]   along this really rigorous line of thinking
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.440]   as to why I'm taking 80% of this stuff.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.280]   - Well, I know people,
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.320]   and actually we know some of the same people,
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.860]   were fanatic about like red light on the testes,
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:59.680]   sunning their testes, putting ice packs on their testes.
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.960]   It's kind of all over the place.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.480]   The number of things that people are trying and doing
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.800]   in order to increase testosterone output
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:07.340]   from their testes is pretty remarkable.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:10.280]   And that said, among some of the women I know,
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.320]   the number of things that they're doing
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.600]   to try and promote longevity and fertility,
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.800]   and in particular skin health, hair health, and nail health,
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.640]   is also kind of outrageous.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.800]   Everything from collagen to red light therapies,
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:24.000]   which may actually have some efficacy in certain cases,
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.960]   but there's a hunger there, right?
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:27.880]   - Oh, for sure.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.780]   One of the things that I hope gets a lot more attention
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:33.160]   is the use of rapamycin for preserving ovarian health.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.600]   So the animal literature on this is pretty impressive, right?
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.600]   So in mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.200]   And so it makes sense, right?
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.480]   I mean, it totally makes sense why the most potent
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.180]   giroprotective molecule we have would also preserve
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:52.720]   and extend ovarian life, at least in mice.
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:57.660]   So I'd love to see the clinical trials done in women
[01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:59.280]   to test this hypothesis.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.500]   - I definitely want to come back to this
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:01.640]   'cause it's a key thing.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.720]   I know that a lot of people are interested
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:05.240]   in female fertility out there,
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.320]   including their male partners.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.000]   So going back to, so now I understand
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.180]   why you don't prescribe clomiphene
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:16.180]   because of this potential dysmosterol link.
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:19.100]   What about testosterone therapy?
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.560]   So less frequent, lower doses,
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:25.840]   less or no estrogen inhibition or aromatase inhibition?
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.600]   - Again, we're only using an aromatase blocker,
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.560]   and we use Aromatex when we do.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:34.560]   It's just to get that estradiol into the range we want.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.800]   I like to see it between 30 and 50.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:37.940]   That's the sweet spot.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:41.360]   And I don't know, I would say like a third,
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.360]   maybe a, not even a third,
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.200]   I'd say probably 20% of men require a microdose
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.800]   of an estrozole to get into that range.
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.620]   Most do not.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:53.080]   And I'd rather err on the side
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:54.920]   of being a little high than a little low.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.880]   So I never really want to be below 25.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:00.960]   If, unless, sometimes it's just below 25 and it is.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.960]   It is what it is, that's fine.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:04.460]   But if we're suppressing it to below 25,
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.860]   I never want to be in that zone.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:09.520]   And then yes, so TRT is ultimately,
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:12.640]   giving testosterone, cipunate is usually what we use.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.040]   - Injectable, so as opposed to cream or pellet.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.480]   - Correct.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.600]   I used to use pellets with women
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:23.880]   for some who were really adamant
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.720]   about the convenience of it.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.120]   But for a bunch of reasons, I just,
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.240]   I'm mostly not doing that.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.620]   And I've never been a fan of pellets in men.
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.100]   - You can't control the dosage once it's in, right?
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:37.940]   - Well, even if you know the dose,
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:38.780]   yeah, that's obviously a problem.
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:40.700]   But I don't think, there's a big difference
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:42.100]   between putting a pellet into a man and a woman.
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.220]   So when you're putting a estrogen pellet into a woman,
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:47.400]   it's like, it's that big.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.820]   When you're putting enough pellets into a man
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:51.540]   for six months of testosterone,
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.780]   it's two sums of pellets that are longer than my finger.
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:56.660]   So you're putting like a V-shape,
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.780]   you're putting it into the gluteal fat.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:01.660]   So it's just a more morbid procedure.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:02.820]   And I don't think it's necessary.
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:05.140]   I think if you know how to manage it
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.980]   through sort of the injections and now--
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:07.820]   - Injections are no big deal.
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:09.560]   - Yeah, well, especially now if you're doing,
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.620]   we're having them do sub-Q injections anyway.
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:14.780]   So it's not IM, they're using a 5/8 inch
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:16.820]   to a one inch, 25 gauge needle,
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.740]   which is about the smallest needle
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:21.420]   you can push the oil through once to twice a week,
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:23.500]   depending on, and by the way, if they're real needlephobes,
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.300]   we use Xyosted, which is a preloaded pen.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:29.820]   - And are you having all men take HCG
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:31.260]   to maintain fertility and testicular size?
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.300]   - Only if they want to.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.140]   - Got it.
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:36.260]   - And by the way, we do not like to use TRT in men who,
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:37.860]   we don't like to use testosterone specifically
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:39.900]   in men who still want to maintain fertility.
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.060]   We just steer them away from that.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.580]   - Because total sperm count goes down.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.500]   - Yeah, we just say, why risk it?
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.080]   Like we'd rather use HCG.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.760]   - Just on its own.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.580]   - Yeah, just wait, just wait until you're done reproducing.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.600]   Bank sperm, wait till you're done reproducing
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.100]   before we go to testosterone.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:54.920]   - What are some of the benefits
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.700]   and what are some of the cautionary notes
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:01.820]   with appropriate TRT, meaning of the kind of contour
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:03.260]   that we're talking about here?
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:08.180]   A lower dose with the yes or no low estrogen control.
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:13.180]   People, what generally people report, how do they feel?
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:14.460]   What does it allow them to do
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.700]   that they couldn't do or feel before?
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:19.860]   And then in terms of what are the markers to look for?
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:24.020]   Is it LDL, blood pressure, water retention, acne,
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:24.840]   those kinds of things?
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.680]   Are there some other things as well?
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.660]   - Yeah, it depends on the doses, right?
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:29.060]   I mean, again, we're using these in really low doses.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.140]   So it's pretty rare that we'd have a patient
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:34.320]   on more than a hundred milligrams a week of testosterone.
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:37.980]   I think for comparison, like a bodybuilder
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:41.900]   could easily take 500 to 1,000 during a high growth phase.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.980]   - I know some of these guys, they go ballistic
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.420]   or they're doing moderate levels of testosterone sibonate,
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:50.700]   but they're also taking dianabolix, andralone,
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:54.500]   SARMs and a bunch of other things.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.180]   I mean, their stacks are kind of ridiculous.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.340]   I mean, no disrespect to that sport,
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:01.460]   but I mean, people are dying like crazy in that sport
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:02.300]   right now. - It's outside
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.380]   of physiology. - Yeah, and I think
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:06.660]   for 99% of people listening, they hear bodybuilder
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:09.660]   and they just go, "Why would somebody do that anyway?"
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:10.980]   I think that's the typical response.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:14.160]   - So the point is, but we owe those guys
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:15.420]   a great deal of gratitude
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:17.100]   'cause they've shown us the boundaries.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.140]   - Including the women.
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:19.780]   - That's right, yeah.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:23.740]   And so those bodybuilders have taught us a lot
[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:26.140]   about what happens.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:31.140]   And so, yeah, the bloating, the water retention, acne,
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:34.020]   hair loss, hair growth, all of those things,
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:36.020]   we understand the truth of it is,
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:39.100]   we just don't see those things in our patients.
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.900]   - But 100 milligrams per week is a very low output.
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:43.240]   My understanding is-- - But it's a physiologic dose.
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:44.940]   I mean, the reality of it is it's enough for most people.
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:47.060]   I mean, probably the highest we've ever had to go
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:49.500]   is maybe 70 twice a week.
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.780]   - What's the youngest patient you've ever had to put on TRT?
[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:54.100]   - Actual testosterone.
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:57:00.060]   Probably, that's a good question, I'm thinking about maybe 40.
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:03.300]   - I think that's great for people to hear
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:04.960]   'cause I know that a lot of guys in their 20s
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.180]   are thinking TRT is the way to go, and I would argue,
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.580]   unless you're doing everything else right
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:11.060]   and you're still hypogonadal and you're really struggling,
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:14.020]   put that time off because also the fertility issue,
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:14.940]   you want to delay the delay.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:17.100]   - Well, again, it depends if when we say TRT,
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.720]   if you're in your 20s and there's no other way,
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:22.560]   I would hope you would be steered toward HCG
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.360]   to at least preserve testicular function.
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:27.840]   Now, again, we don't actually know if after being on HCG
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.540]   for 10 years, your pituitary will still work.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.240]   - Right, you won't be able to make your own luteinizing.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.260]   - Exactly, so it might be the case
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:37.640]   that you're gonna need something upstream of that,
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:39.620]   like Clomid to kickstart it.
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:42.500]   But again, I don't want anybody who's listening to this
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.360]   who's using Clomid for fertility
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.240]   to think that there's anything wrong with it.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.940]   My concern over this became like,
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:50.680]   if you're gonna be on this for 10 years, is it problematic?
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.860]   Not if you're using this for a course of IVF
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:54.120]   or something like that.
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:57.400]   So again, if we felt that someone's pituitary
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.800]   was not working, I would be happy to put three months
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.480]   of Clomid on them to kind of try to see
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.840]   if we could blast it back.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:05.640]   - Do you have men cycle on and off testosterone
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:06.680]   at these low dosages?
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:08.720]   Are they taking a month vacation from it every once in a while?
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:09.560]   - Yeah, it totally depends.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:10.880]   You know, I was talking to a patient yesterday
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:13.680]   where we're gonna do, we just decided to change the cycle,
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.720]   eight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG,
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:17.400]   eight weeks on, then eight weeks on HCG.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.520]   So that's gonna be a cycle
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.520]   that maintains his testosterone level,
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.800]   but fluctuates between endogenous, exogenous,
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:23.940]   endogenous, exogenous.
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.600]   Sometimes we'll just do testosterone on, off, on, off.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:30.680]   And there it's like, how much can he replenish naturally,
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.320]   but understanding his T will dip during those off cycles.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:37.200]   - Seems to me there's a tremendous incentive
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.760]   for somebody to develop a molecule
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:43.440]   that can directly target SHBG,
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.360]   besides oxyandrel and Anivar, right?
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:49.960]   If one could just drop SHBG just the tiniest bit,
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.000]   it seems like one could adjust the free T
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.680]   in a way that would be great.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:56.640]   I don't know why that molecule is so hard to target,
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.760]   but somebody ought to do it.
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.920]   The chemistry can't be that hard.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.100]   - I talked with Patrick Arnold about this
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:02.800]   many, many years ago.
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.840]   I wish I could remember what his ID,
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:09.560]   he had a comment about this that at the time made sense.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.560]   And I don't remember what it was.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:13.160]   'Cause I had that thought too, like, man,
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:15.800]   especially for that subset of guys
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:17.600]   who have normal testosterone,
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.640]   but they're just overbinding it.
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.360]   I'm really glad that you brought up this issue
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:23.080]   of total testosterone versus free T.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:25.500]   And the reason is ever since going on podcasts
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.560]   and talking about this stuff
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.540]   and talking about it on this podcast,
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:30.080]   people will send me their numbers,
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.400]   they'll send me their charts,
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:33.020]   and then they'll send photos of themselves.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.840]   And I can tell you, while I'm not a clinician
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.220]   and I haven't done fancy statistics on it,
[01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:38.600]   there's very little correlation
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:40.680]   between someone's absolute testosterone
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.000]   and how they appear.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.040]   I mean, some of these guys look really lean, really strong,
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:49.360]   and they'll say, oh, total testosterone is 550.
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:50.640]   480, right?
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.920]   And then other people, you know, testosterone is 860,
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:55.540]   but they, you look at them and you think,
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.800]   oh, they kind of have a kind of a doughy look to them.
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:00.320]   And so it's gotta be this free testosterone thing
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.540]   plus estrogen, et cetera.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:04.080]   - Well, but also training and nutrition too, right?
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:08.240]   I mean, I just think, I think for all this talk
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.400]   about testosterone, which I enjoy talking about,
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.240]   and I enjoy talking about the data
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:15.040]   on long-term health consequences of testosterone,
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.460]   'cause it's another controversial topic,
[02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:20.020]   I also think people kind of overstate its importance.
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:20.860]   - I agree.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.580]   - And I think there's a group of people who think,
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:24.940]   if I could just fix my testosterone,
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:25.880]   everything will be better.
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:29.660]   And it's sort of like, no, actually that's not true at all.
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:32.620]   Really, the only purpose in my mind of fixing testosterone
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:36.260]   is to give you the capacity to work harder.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:38.640]   It's really going to help you recover more
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:39.580]   from your workouts.
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:41.980]   This should just give you a greater ability
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:45.020]   to experience muscle protein synthesis.
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:47.340]   So, you know, if I just give you a bunch of testosterone
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.500]   and you sit on the couch and your nutrition doesn't change
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:50.580]   and you're not exercising anymore,
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:53.580]   you're not gonna experience any benefits of this thing.
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.880]   I mean, my testosterone level has fluctuated quite a bit
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.060]   throughout my life.
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:59.460]   And when I think about as an adult,
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:01.420]   not sort of including when I was sort of
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.980]   a fanatical teenager, but as an adult,
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:08.100]   when was I at my absolute most insane physique,
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:11.300]   like my best performance on a DEXA scan?
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:16.060]   Would have been 30, I was 38 years old.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.260]   By DEXA, I was 7% body fat.
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:21.500]   My fat-free mass index was like 23.2,
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:24.780]   23.3 kilograms per meter squared.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:29.780]   I mean, I was huge, strong, and totally ripped.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:32.160]   My testosterone was in the toilet.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.740]   I was over-training like crazy.
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:38.860]   I was exercising probably 26 hours a week,
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:41.420]   killing it in the gym, swimming like a banshee,
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:43.660]   cycling like my life depended on it,
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:46.580]   grossly over-trained, low T,
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:51.500]   but I mean, physically looked like twice the guy I am today.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.340]   Today, my T is probably twice as high as it was then.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:57.140]   So now, you could say, well, Peter,
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.700]   what if you took T back then?
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.820]   How much better could you have been?
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.100]   Sure.
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.820]   But again, I think the take-home is
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:06.740]   just giving somebody T doesn't do much of anything.
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:08.980]   It probably helps on the insulin resistance front
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:12.580]   without any other thing, but to me, that's a waste.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:15.260]   That's squandering the gift that it is giving you,
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:17.900]   which is the ability to do more work
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.200]   and capture the benefit of it via muscle protein synthesis.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.040]   - I agree.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.780]   And I think that the psychological effect of testosterone,
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:27.820]   whether or not it's exogenous or endogenous,
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:30.600]   is it makes effort feel good.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:31.440]   - Yeah.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.760]   - At some level, it really seems to do that.
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.900]   And Sapolsky tells me the main reason,
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.520]   or mechanistically, the main reason that it can do that
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.060]   is by adjusting levels of activity in the amygdala.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:41.900]   - Interesting.
[02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:43.980]   There's some interesting imaging there.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:47.480]   I'd love to chat more about the cholesterol pathway.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.480]   And I know this is a huge landscape as well,
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.000]   but I think we're doing a good job of diving in deep,
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.980]   but not getting stuck in the underlying currents at all.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:03:02.060]   There's tremendous debate about whether or not
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:05.380]   dietary cholesterol directly relates to,
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:09.860]   or does not relate to serum cholesterol, LDL and HDL.
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:11.260]   Here's my- - Is there?
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.340]   - I think, well, let me put it this way.
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:16.320]   There are people that argue,
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.500]   I'm certainly not arguing that,
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:20.560]   there are people that argue that
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.620]   if one eats a ton of saturated fat,
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:27.580]   that LDL goes up and HDL goes down.
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:29.660]   - Okay, but that's not dietary cholesterol per se.
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:31.160]   - No, not dietary cholesterol per se.
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:35.500]   But, and then there are people that argue that, you know,
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:38.960]   any increase in saturated fat intake is going to be bad,
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.780]   that you already synthesize enough cholesterol
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.620]   for hormone production, et cetera.
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:44.220]   I'd like to talk about this in terms of
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:45.860]   how one should read their charts.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:49.700]   My LDL is in what I'm told is healthy range.
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:52.340]   My HDL is in what I'm told is healthy range.
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:55.700]   I do try and not overeat things like butter, cheese,
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:58.020]   and red meat, but I do eat some of those things
[02:03:58.020 --> 02:03:59.420]   and I feel pretty good.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:04.420]   But most people are operating under the assumption
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:08.300]   that eating saturated fat is bad and you only do it
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.940]   insofar as you want to taste it.
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:13.120]   And then, of course, there's a small group of people
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.580]   that love to eat organs and meats
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:19.060]   and really pack cholesterol and would argue
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:21.940]   that it doesn't matter if your LDL is 870,
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:24.420]   it's not going to impact your health.
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:29.080]   What's the reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol,
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:31.800]   saturated fat, at least in your view?
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.700]   - So first, let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat,
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:38.940]   just for the listener, 'cause we use them,
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:40.080]   I don't want to make sure people understand.
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:43.620]   So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule.
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.600]   So it's a ringed molecule.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:49.180]   God, I used to know exactly what its structure was,
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:53.020]   but it could have 36 carbons for all I remember.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:56.700]   It is a lipid, so it is a hydrophobic molecule
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:05:00.980]   that is synthesized by every cell in the human body.
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:04.020]   It is so important that without it,
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:07.740]   if you look at sort of genetic conditions
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:10.580]   that impair cholesterol synthesis,
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:14.300]   depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero.
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.780]   So in other words, anything that really interferes
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:19.380]   with our ability to produce cholesterol
[02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:23.020]   is a threat to us as a species.
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:26.440]   And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:29.460]   the cell membrane of every cell in our body.
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:33.020]   So as you know, but maybe the listeners don't,
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:35.180]   even though a cell is a spherical thing,
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:36.900]   it has to be fluid, right?
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:41.340]   It's not just a rigid sphere, like a blow up ball, right?
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.940]   It's gotta be able to kind of move in this way
[02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:47.380]   to mesh with other cells.
[02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:50.620]   It also has to accommodate having porous structures
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:54.340]   that traverse its membrane to allow ions
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.700]   and things like that to go across.
[02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:59.420]   And it's cholesterol that gives the fluidity
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:01.140]   to that membrane.
[02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:02.900]   It's also, as you're alluding to,
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:06.220]   the backbone of some of the most important hormones
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:09.260]   in our body, estrogen, progesterone,
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:11.460]   testosterone, cortisol.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:14.580]   So we have this thing, super important.
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:17.940]   Okay, then let's talk about, does cholesterol,
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:20.220]   can you get cholesterol in your diet?
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.380]   Yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol.
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:29.820]   What was known in 1960, but somehow escaped
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.640]   everybody's imagination until finally,
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:34.540]   the American Heart Association acknowledged this
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:37.980]   a few years ago, is that the cholesterol you eat
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:40.260]   does not really make it into your body.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:42.700]   And the reason for that is it's hysterified.
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:45.080]   So we have, and not to get too nerdy,
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:47.500]   but I think people, I really think it's important
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.740]   people understand how this thing works.
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:51.820]   So we have cells in our gut, enterocytes,
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:54.420]   they're the endothelial cells of our gut.
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:57.540]   They have, each one of them has basically
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:58.740]   two transporters on them.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:03.040]   So the first is called the Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter.
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:07.040]   The second is called the ATP-Binding cassette G5-G8.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:11.460]   Okay, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.840]   will bring in any sterile, cholesterol,
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.520]   zosterol, phytosterol, any sterile
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.520]   that fits through the door will come in.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:25.240]   Virtually all of that is the cholesterol we produce
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:27.480]   that gets taken back to the liver,
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:30.960]   that the liver packages in bile and secretes.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.800]   So that's what aids in our digestion,
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:34.420]   which is another thing I should have mentioned earlier.
[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:36.780]   In addition to using cholesterol
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:38.780]   for cell membranes and hormones,
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:41.200]   we wouldn't be able to digest our food without cholesterol
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:44.080]   because it's what makes up the bile salts.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:47.200]   So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.880]   in a pool throughout our body,
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:51.580]   and this is the way it gets back into the body.
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:54.720]   It's through this Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter.
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.640]   When it gets in there, the body,
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:58.560]   this is the checkpoint of regulation.
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:07:59.460]   This is where the body says,
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:02.340]   "Do you have enough cholesterol in the body, yes or no?"
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:05.160]   If yes, I will let that cholesterol
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.360]   make its way into the circulation.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.060]   So it'll go off the basolateral side of the cell,
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:12.080]   not the luminal side, into the body.
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:13.600]   Alternatively, the body says,
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.100]   "You know what, we have enough cholesterol.
[02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:17.440]   I'm gonna let you poop this out."
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:20.040]   And now the ATP binding cassette will shoot it out.
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.740]   It'll go back into the luminal side, and away it goes.
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:27.900]   So all of the cholesterol in our body is not esterified,
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.140]   meaning it doesn't have that big,
[02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:31.840]   bulky side chain attached to it.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.460]   The cholesterol you eat is esterified,
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:37.180]   and an esterified cholesterol molecule
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:38.940]   simply can't physically pass
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:41.200]   through that Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 transporter.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.200]   Now, we probably manage to deesterify
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.260]   10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol.
[02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:52.340]   So in other words, there are small amounts
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.880]   of dietary cholesterol that do make their way
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:59.780]   into our circulation, but it represents a small fraction
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:02.160]   of our total body's pool of cholesterol.
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.420]   Again, this was known even by Ancel Keys,
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:08.560]   the guy who turned fat into the biggest boogeyman
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:09.580]   of all time.
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:12.760]   Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:16.040]   Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:19.120]   Again, it took the American Heart Association
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.380]   another 60 years to figure that out,
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:23.560]   but even now they acknowledge that.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.500]   Dietary cholesterol has no bearing.
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:29.980]   - So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies,
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:32.960]   or at least people who are highly credentialed
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.620]   from good institutions, claiming that eating
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:38.380]   saturated fat, cheese, and-- - Saturated fat's different.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:40.560]   - Saturated fat, red meat, things that are rich
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.760]   in cholesterol, to be more specific,
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:47.940]   is bad for us in terms of our eventual LDL.
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:49.140]   - So this is two different things.
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:52.660]   So saturated fat consumption in many people
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:54.900]   will raise LDL cholesterol.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:57.740]   So it's important to differentiate between the,
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:09:58.940]   what is saturated fat?
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.880]   So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid,
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.060]   just so people understand, totally different molecule
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:03.900]   from cholesterol.
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:06.000]   Cholesterol is this very complicated ring structure,
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.140]   multiple rings stuck together.
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:11.360]   SFA, saturated fat, is just a long chain fatty acid
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:14.200]   that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds,
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:16.920]   and it can exist in isolation, it can exist
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:19.560]   in a triglyceride, triacylglyceride,
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:23.180]   or a phospholipid, or all sorts of things like that.
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:27.780]   So when we eat foods that contain fat,
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:30.380]   basically there are three distinctions for that fat.
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:31.480]   Is it saturated?
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:33.260]   Is it monounsaturated, one double bond?
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:35.860]   Or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds?
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:40.680]   The observation that eating saturated fat
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:43.980]   raises cholesterol is generally correct.
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:46.920]   But again, now it makes, because if we're gonna start
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:49.160]   talking about LDL, we have to explain what LDL is.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:50.180]   This is another one of those things
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:52.420]   that's just so grossly misunderstood
[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:57.420]   that it makes having discussions about this very complicated.
[02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:00.380]   Let's go back to the cholesterol problem, right?
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:04.460]   So every cell in our body makes cholesterol,
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:08.500]   and almost without exception, they make enough.
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:11.340]   There are a handful of times, however,
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.980]   when a cell needs to borrow cholesterol from another cell.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:18.000]   Okay, so how would you do this, right?
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.900]   So if you're playing God for a minute
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:22.760]   and you wanna design a system,
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.980]   you have to be able to transport cholesterol
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:27.000]   from one cell to another.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.140]   The most logical place you would transport this
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:31.580]   is through the circulation.
[02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:35.220]   And the problem with circulation is it's water.
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:36.900]   Plasma is water.
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:38.220]   So now you have this problem,
[02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:43.220]   which is I want to transport cargo that is hydrophobic
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:45.900]   in a hydrophilic medium, can't do it.
[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:48.340]   So if you think about all the things
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:52.920]   that we transport in our blood, sodium, electrolytes,
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.540]   glucose, things like that, they're water soluble.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:57.380]   It's easy.
[02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:59.860]   They just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone.
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:01.980]   But when you wanna move cholesterol,
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.980]   you have to package it in something that's hydrophilic.
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:07.940]   That something is called a lipoprotein.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.500]   So we have these spherical molecules
[02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:11.980]   that are lipid on the inside,
[02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:14.800]   protein on the outside, lipoprotein,
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:18.200]   and inside they contain cholesterol and triglycerides.
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:20.560]   So now you've got the spherical thing,
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:23.140]   triglyceride, cholesterol on the inside,
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:26.520]   and it's chaperoned by a hydrophilic molecule
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:30.360]   that allows it to move through our circulation.
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.320]   And those lipoproteins exist in different densities.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:37.360]   So if you run these out on a gel electrophoresis plate,
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:39.160]   you'll identify different densities.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:40.980]   The density is a function of how much protein
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:42.740]   and how much lipid is in it.
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:44.940]   So the highest density of this is called
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:47.000]   a high density lipoprotein.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.020]   And the lowest density of this is called
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:52.600]   a very low density lipoprotein, a VLDL.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:54.740]   And then next to that, you have an LDL,
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:56.200]   a low density lipoprotein.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:57.800]   And then next to that, you have an IDL,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:59.940]   an intermediate density lipoprotein.
[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:06.260]   So, you know, it actually goes VLDL, IDL, LDL.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:11.800]   But anyway, so when people say my LDL is high
[02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:15.400]   or my LDL is 100, what are they saying?
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.800]   They're saying the cholesterol concentration
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:21.500]   of my LDL particles is 100 milligrams per deciliter.
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:24.580]   So the total cholesterol concentration you have
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.120]   in your circulation is that number
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.000]   that says total cholesterol.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.560]   So if someone's blood panel says my total cholesterol is 200,
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:33.000]   it means that if you take all the lipoproteins
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.880]   in their circulation, bust them open,
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:36.400]   and measure the cholesterol content,
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.440]   it's 200 milligrams per deciliter.
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.560]   And for all intents and purposes,
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:42.940]   because the IDLs are so short-lived,
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:45.360]   that's basically the sum of your LDL cholesterol,
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.900]   your VLDL cholesterol, and your HDL cholesterol.
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:51.580]   Those three things sum to your total cholesterol.
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.700]   - What about LDL little a that you mentioned earlier?
[02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:55.460]   - LP little a is another, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:56.460]   He's another actor.
[02:13:56.460 --> 02:14:00.380]   He is a special type of LDL that, again,
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:02.900]   in sort of 10 to 20% of the population
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:04.540]   is a really bad actor.
[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:09.140]   So that's an LDL that has another apolipoprotein on it
[02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:11.540]   called apolipoprotein little a.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:14.540]   The other thing I'll just say on this,
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:16.960]   because earlier I mentioned apoB,
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:19.880]   there are two broad families of lipoproteins.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:22.120]   There are those that are wrapped in apoBs
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.400]   and those that are wrapped in apoAs.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.300]   The apoA family is the HDL family.
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:31.860]   The apoB family is the VLDL, IDL, LDL family.
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:32.700]   - I see.
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:35.220]   So for somebody who, let's say their total cholesterol is,
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.860]   let's just stay with 200 for simplicity,
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:41.660]   what do you like to see in terms of the HDL/LDL ratio?
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:43.100]   - Couldn't care less.
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:45.380]   I only care about apoB.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:47.700]   I only care about apoB.
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:51.180]   I care about the causative agent of atherosclerosis.
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:54.580]   ApoB is the thing that drives atherosclerosis.
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:58.140]   - And what levels are attractive or repulsive for you
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:02.120]   when you see levels of apoB that are blank,
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:04.780]   you get really concerned, what rate-
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:06.940]   - It depends on the person's objectives.
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:10.540]   So again, we take a very different view.
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:12.260]   I mean, we have-
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:15.380]   - Vitality now, and I want to live to be 100.
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:16.860]   I'm assuming some taper-
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:18.620]   - If you tell me you want to live to be 100,
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:20.180]   you're going to need to keep your apoB
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:22.380]   below 30 milligrams per deciliter.
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:25.140]   - Let's say I want to live to be 100,
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:29.660]   but I also, well, how about I don't care how long I live,
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:32.560]   but I want to feel great while I live.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:33.840]   - Again, it depends, right?
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:35.340]   Like anybody who's had a heart attack
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:37.180]   is going to be compromised in their ability
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:40.100]   to feel well after, right?
[02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:42.220]   - I guess I say it that way,
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:43.340]   because if you're going to tell me
[02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:46.940]   that in order to achieve that live to 100 level,
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:50.100]   I'm going to have to give up my personal life
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:53.040]   and my brain functioning,
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:54.300]   then I'm not really interested in that.
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:57.060]   - Sure, but to get LDL levels,
[02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:58.900]   and really, again, people think of it as LDL,
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:00.180]   it's really apoB, right?
[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:04.300]   ApoB is this total concentration of LDL and VLDL,
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:05.140]   and that's what matters.
[02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:06.940]   Those are the big atherogenic particles.
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.180]   LDL also includes the Lp(a),
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:11.660]   although the concentration of Lp(a)
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:13.740]   is relatively speaking so small
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:16.860]   that it doesn't generally show up as much in the apoB.
[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:20.300]   So we treat apoB, and basically what it comes down to
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.420]   is you want apoB to be as close to the level
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:24.980]   as it was when you were born.
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:27.900]   So we start developing heart disease when we're born.
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.940]   That's just the way it is.
[02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:32.940]   The autopsy studies make this abundantly clear.
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:36.260]   When you look at autopsies of young people
[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:37.560]   who are dying in their 20s,
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:39.400]   and this was first done in the 1970s,
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:40.740]   it was again repeated.
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.540]   Again, it's always done after we have a war, right?
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:46.160]   So in the 1970s, it was done on people who died in Vietnam.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:49.020]   In the early 2000s, it was done on mostly young men
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:52.460]   but some young women who were dying in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:54.580]   And we saw without any ambiguity
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:56.900]   that cardiovascular disease is already taking hold
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:59.060]   in people who are 18, 19, 20 years old.
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:03.220]   And to be clear, they aren't gonna die of atherosclerosis
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:04.060]   at that age.
[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:06.100]   They're still 40, 50 years away from it,
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:09.260]   but this is a lifelong disease.
[02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:12.940]   And we also know that the disease can't really develop
[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:16.060]   until apoB reaches a certain threshold.
[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:17.580]   And that's the threshold that most of us get to
[02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:20.000]   by the time we're sort of in our teens.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.300]   So it's this really young apoB level
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:26.460]   of kind of 20 to 30 milligrams per deciliter
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.940]   that makes it impossible to get atherosclerosis.
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:33.940]   So apoB is necessary, but not sufficient to develop ASCVD.
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:35.380]   Now that, go ahead.
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:36.520]   - Oh, I'm sorry, I was just gonna ask,
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:38.480]   what are some of the top behavioral,
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.380]   nutritional supplementation, if any,
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:45.820]   based and prescription drug based ways to target apoB?
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:50.180]   - Well, nutritionally, you basically have two big tools,
[02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:52.660]   right, and it depends on what's driving up apoB.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.080]   So apoB, remember, is the concentration
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.260]   of LDL and VLDL particles.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:00.500]   And what do they carry?
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:02.180]   Cholesterol and triglycerides.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:05.340]   So anything that reduces cholesterol
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:09.840]   and reduces triglycerides is going to reduce apoB.
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.700]   Triglycerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake.
[02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:17.300]   So more insulin resistance, more carbohydrate intake,
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:19.020]   more triglycerides.
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:22.460]   So we, I mean, clinically, this is readily apparent
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.860]   to anyone who treats patients.
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:25.360]   If you restrict carbohydrates,
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.100]   you will reduce triglycerides.
[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:29.020]   That just happens all day long.
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.540]   But if you reduce triglycerides
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:35.220]   by raising fat intake so much, it can still raise apoB.
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:37.020]   So you have to be able to think about it.
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:41.700]   So in an ideal world, it's can you lower saturated fat,
[02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:44.900]   which tends to be the one that is most driving apoB,
[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:48.060]   while lowering carbohydrate, and then see what you can get.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:49.580]   But here's the reality of it is,
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:51.860]   there's nobody with dietary intervention
[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:52.940]   that's going to get to a level
[02:18:52.940 --> 02:18:54.620]   of 30 milligrams per deciliter.
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:55.740]   I mean, I've never seen anybody--
[02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:57.040]   - Under dietary intervention.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:57.880]   - Yeah.
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.700]   - So what are the other things--
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:18:59.900]   - It's got to be pharmacologic at this point.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:01.220]   - Statin type interventions.
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:03.040]   - Well, now you have multiple classes of drugs.
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:05.140]   So the tried and true is the statin.
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:08.280]   So statins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis.
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:10.980]   And the net effect of that is that the,
[02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:13.620]   so the liver is really sensitive to cholesterol levels.
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.860]   It doesn't want too much, it doesn't want too little.
[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:18.100]   When you inhibit cholesterol synthesis,
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.780]   the liver says, I want more cholesterol.
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:23.660]   So it puts more LDL receptors on its surface
[02:19:23.660 --> 02:19:26.620]   and it pulls the LDL out of circulation.
[02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:30.780]   That's what lowers the LDL in the circulation.
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:35.840]   So again, nine statins in use today.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:38.760]   We typically use four of them.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:40.060]   The side effect profile,
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:43.420]   contrary to kind of all the sort of statin-hating
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:46.100]   propaganda out there, very benign, right?
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.280]   5% of people experience muscle soreness,
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:50.220]   which reverses upon cessation.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:54.580]   - Cognitive effects.
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:56.820]   - Again, I think it's,
[02:19:56.820 --> 02:19:59.100]   in terms of actual comparing it at a placebo,
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:00.380]   no effect whatsoever, right?
[02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:02.320]   So does that mean that you put a patient on it,
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:03.700]   they won't complain of something?
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:05.700]   No, but if you look at clinical trials,
[02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:07.380]   there's no evidence whatsoever
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:09.340]   that statins impair cognition.
[02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:11.220]   There's also no evidence in clinical trials
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.200]   that they accelerate the risk of neurodegenerative disease.
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:14.540]   In fact, it's the opposite.
[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:18.500]   Now we will, there's a very nuanced case we make, Andrew,
[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:19.860]   which is we'll look at patients
[02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:23.300]   with highly suppressed desmosterol levels.
[02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:24.700]   We will back off.
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:28.380]   We do want to maintain desmosterol above a certain level
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:31.700]   because of some evidence that is still,
[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:32.860]   I think, very preliminary,
[02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:35.140]   but enough for us that we say, why take the chance?
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:37.180]   We have so many other tools to lower cholesterol.
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.340]   Why would we over suppress synthesis
[02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:40.840]   in a susceptible individual?
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:45.500]   So the next tool you look at is a drug
[02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:49.080]   that blocks the absorption or the reabsorption of cholesterol.
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:51.580]   Remember that Niemann-Pixie-1-like-1 transporter?
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:55.520]   So that guy has a drug called ezetimibe
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:57.280]   that just mechanically blocks it.
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:01.340]   So in people, and that's why I mentioned earlier,
[02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:03.580]   we measure all those sterols in people,
[02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:05.700]   so we also measure things called phytosterols,
[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:07.460]   and the phytosterols give us an indication
[02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:09.320]   of how active that transporter is.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:10.640]   So the higher your phytosterols,
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:13.600]   the more likely you are to respond to ezetimibe.
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:15.960]   Next class of drugs is a drug
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:18.300]   that blocks cholesterol synthesis, but only in the liver.
[02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:19.920]   So the statin does it globally.
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:23.420]   This other drug called benbedoic acid
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:24.600]   does it only in the liver.
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:26.720]   So it has a very similar mechanism to statins,
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:29.860]   different enzyme, not quite as potent,
[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:31.220]   but way fewer side effects.
[02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:32.620]   So any patient that's having a response
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:35.940]   to statins that's adverse, we'll try this other thing.
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:37.060]   - What's it called one more time?
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:37.900]   - Benbedoic acid.
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:39.180]   - Benbedoic acid.
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:42.980]   - The most potent drug of the lot is the PCSK9 inhibitor.
[02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:46.100]   So PCSK9, it's a protein that was discovered
[02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:48.980]   in the late '90s, I believe,
[02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:53.440]   is responsible for the degradation of LDL receptors.
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:55.820]   This was first discovered in people
[02:21:55.820 --> 02:21:58.460]   who had a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia,
[02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:59.420]   or FH.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:01.700]   So these are people that have incredibly high cholesterol.
[02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:05.580]   Typically, their total cholesterol level is 300.
[02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:08.220]   Their LDL cholesterol is typically
[02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:10.180]   north of 200 milligrams per deciliter.
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:14.320]   This is a disease that is defined by the phenotype,
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:15.160]   not the genotype.
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:17.120]   So the phenotype has a very clear definition,
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:18.700]   which I basically just gave you.
[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:21.680]   The genotype is there's a million paths to get there.
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:23.700]   There's over 3,000 mutations that are known
[02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:25.080]   to produce that phenotype.
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:26.880]   This was discovered to be one of them.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:29.880]   In people who had hyperfunctioning PCSK9,
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:35.500]   this protein was just constantly hammering
[02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:37.620]   and destroying the LDL receptors,
[02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:40.020]   and so their LDL would be huge.
[02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:41.840]   And by extension, their total cholesterol would be.
[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:46.840]   So in 2006, Helen Hobbs and colleagues
[02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:49.820]   discovered an opposite group of population,
[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:52.420]   people who had LDL cholesterol naturally
[02:22:52.420 --> 02:22:55.020]   of 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter,
[02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:57.180]   which would be an ApoB of about 20 milligrams
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:00.820]   per deciliter, and who never got heart disease.
[02:23:00.820 --> 02:23:01.860]   They were immune to heart disease,
[02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:03.180]   no matter how long they lived.
[02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:04.240]   And they had the opposite.
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:07.060]   They had hypofunctioning PCSK9.
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.160]   And so that was 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:11.160]   That basically got a whole bunch of drug companies
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:13.980]   hot on the trail of producing a drug to mimic it.
[02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:15.740]   So now we have these antibodies,
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:17.780]   and they're wildly effective.
[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:21.260]   - What percentage of your patients over 45
[02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:24.100]   do you have on either a statin
[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:25.380]   or on one of these other classic compounds?
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.100]   - Well, often it's in combinations,
[02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:29.260]   and I would say 80%.
[02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:30.100]   - Eight zero.
[02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:31.700]   - We have to remember what our objective is.
[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:34.180]   Like, we're in the business of trying
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:36.760]   to make sure people live as long as possible.
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:39.620]   And you have to take a sort of worldview of this, right?
[02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:41.360]   If you, like, what's the most prevalent
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:42.760]   cause of death globally?
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:43.580]   - It's the cardiovascular disease.
[02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:45.640]   - Yeah, and like, how close is it?
[02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:48.340]   So the last year before COVID,
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:49.800]   COVID kind of messes up these numbers a little bit.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:54.800]   But if you go to 2019, 18.6 million people
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:56.740]   died of heart disease.
[02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:59.260]   Number two, cancer, 10 million.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:05.040]   Like, nothing's in the zip code of atherosclerosis.
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:06.640]   And if you remember what I just said,
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:09.700]   if you took everybody in their 20s
[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:14.060]   and reduced them to a level of that of a child,
[02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:16.460]   you'd make ASCVD an orphan disease.
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:20.080]   So the question is, can you do that?
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:21.260]   - Why don't we hear more about this?
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:22.460]   I realize there's some nuance.
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:24.000]   It's not straightforward.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.480]   It's not as simple as saying eat less cheese, red meat,
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:29.520]   and watch your LDL get on a statin.
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:33.600]   But why do we hear so little about ApoB
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:35.060]   in the general discussion?
[02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:38.600]   Social media is such a skewed landscape, as we know.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:44.600]   People shouting into tunnels of varying clarity.
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:48.600]   Some are beautiful bronze tunnels
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:51.060]   with clean walls and others are sewer lines, right?
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:52.300]   [laughing]
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:55.740]   And they all converge in the same place, right, as we know.
[02:24:55.740 --> 02:24:57.400]   But why do we hear so little about this?
[02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:59.460]   I mean, I'm not on a statin,
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:00.620]   but now I'm beginning to think that
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:02.320]   maybe that might be a good idea to consider
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.000]   one of these other compounds.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.280]   I don't know the last time I looked
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:06.560]   at my ApoBs specifically.
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:07.780]   I'm guessing my physician did.
[02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:10.520]   But why don't we hear more about this?
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.920]   This sounds so important.
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:14.720]   It sounds like the most important conversation
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:16.820]   'cause all the hormone stuff and all the stuff
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:21.820]   about smoking and head injuries and ADHD and all the rest,
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:24.400]   I mean, is irrelevant if you're dead, right?
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.160]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:27.500]   I don't think I have a great insight
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:30.480]   as to why this isn't more front and center.
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:34.360]   I think the bigger problem is
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:36.460]   why don't we even understand how to think about it?
[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:39.260]   I mean, and there's a whole chapter in my book
[02:25:39.260 --> 02:25:42.020]   I'm working on that really gets to this problem
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:46.820]   of why aren't we looking at atherosclerosis
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:49.380]   in terms of treating the causative agent?
[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:53.020]   Instead, we look at modifying 10-year risk.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.180]   So that's the fundamental difference
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:56.940]   between what I call medicine 2.0 and medicine 3.0.
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:00.080]   Medicine 2.0, which is what we're generally practicing today,
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:01.520]   when it comes to ASCVD, says,
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.460]   look, we will treat you.
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:05.280]   We will lower that LDL cholesterol.
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:06.560]   They still don't talk about ApoB,
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:08.320]   but that's a very American thing.
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:09.740]   If you go outside of the United States,
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:11.020]   everybody's talking about ApoB.
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:13.240]   It's in the guidelines in Europe and Canada, everywhere else.
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.660]   The United States is very stubborn on this,
[02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:18.020]   and it's due to a couple of really weird personalities
[02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:19.080]   in the lipid world.
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:28.340]   But the paradigm is when your 10-year risk reaches 5%,
[02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:30.700]   and there's a 5% chance
[02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:32.540]   that you're gonna have a heart attack, stroke, or die
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:35.060]   in the next 10 years, now it's time to treat you.
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:39.400]   Medicine 3.0 says that's not the way to think about it.
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.700]   You treat the causative agent.
[02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:44.500]   If there's a causative agent, you treat it.
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:46.940]   If blood pressure raises the risk of heart disease,
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:48.380]   you lower blood pressure.
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:51.340]   If smoking raises the risk of something, you treat smoking.
[02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:57.140]   And the reason that the risk model is so bad
[02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:58.520]   when you're looking at 10-year risk
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:01.400]   is age is the biggest driver of risk.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:02.480]   I mean, bar none, right?
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:07.080]   So if you take a 70-year-old with perfect lipids
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:10.040]   and perfect blood pressure and perfect everything,
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:14.040]   their 10-year risk of ASCVD is probably
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:16.480]   four to five times higher
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:19.080]   than the most unhealthy 30-year-old.
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:20.040]   It's not even close.
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:21.960]   - It's a lot like eye disease.
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:23.100]   There are exceptions, of course,
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:24.640]   but you always say that the biggest risk factor
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:28.200]   for going blind from glaucoma is being an older person,
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:30.200]   frankly.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:31.480]   - Right, so if you could identify
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:33.720]   what the risk factors are for glaucoma,
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:37.720]   imagine if the paradigm was we're only gonna treat it
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:40.320]   when your risk of blindness reaches 5%,
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:42.400]   which isn't triggered until you're old enough.
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:45.120]   Anyway, wouldn't you rather know that when you're 30
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:48.320]   and say, wait, if maybe being in the sun without sunglasses
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:51.520]   or using this type of eye drop or something like that
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:53.960]   has a negative impact, I would rather know that sooner.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:56.600]   So that's the fundamental difference.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:01.600]   It's a philosophical difference with respect to prevention.
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:06.160]   And I will acknowledge that in one element of prevention,
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.160]   I make no consideration.
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.040]   I am only coming at this through the lens of the individual.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:13.960]   I am never coming at this through the lens of society.
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:16.200]   That makes my life easier
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:17.660]   and it makes the problem I'm solving easier.
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:19.040]   I don't have to answer
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.240]   the quality-adjusted life of your problem.
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:24.520]   I don't have to ask the question, is it economical
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:26.700]   to treat people at 30?
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:27.900]   I don't know the answer to that question.
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.520]   But I also know that when you're trying to solve
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:30.520]   really complicated problems,
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:31.960]   the more you can simplify, the better.
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:34.840]   So I've just acknowledged openly, not solving that.
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:36.760]   If you wanna criticize me for it, that's fine.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:38.240]   Let's be transparent.
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:41.000]   But all I care about is the person I'm sitting across from.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.800]   And in that situation, it's really their decision
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:46.640]   if they can justify the cost of treatment.
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:50.320]   - An esoteric question and then a less esoteric question.
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.480]   The esoteric question relates to something
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:56.580]   that I think is a little bit niche, but not necessarily so,
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:29:00.280]   which is peptides and stem cells and PRP.
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:02.760]   I don't wanna go off on too much of a tangent on rehab,
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.240]   but I know you've done a number of posts
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:06.040]   on social media recently that were,
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:07.720]   I have to just tell you, are really thoughtful
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:09.240]   and I really appreciate that you're willing to share
[02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:12.280]   your own tissue rehabilitation experience
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:14.680]   and point people to that because this is a landscape
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:16.000]   that a lot of people are in
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.720]   and they don't know how to navigate it.
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:20.240]   And a mutual friend of ours, not to be named,
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:23.600]   sent me a text and said, I'm gonna be talking to Atiyah
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:27.320]   and what do you know about studies on things like BPC-157,
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.480]   this gastric peptide, that anecdotally,
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:34.440]   again, anecdotally, people report getting injections of this
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:35.920]   in the shoulder, knee, et cetera,
[02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:38.080]   and feeling so much better, so much faster,
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:42.380]   but there really aren't good studies, controlled studies.
[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:44.880]   And you hear all the same sorts of things
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:47.760]   about platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:50.120]   which if someone tells you there are a lot of stem cells in
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:51.280]   them, they're lying,
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:52.720]   there are not a lot of stem cells in them.
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:54.080]   And you also hear about stem cells,
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:56.440]   which are not FDA approved, at least in this, you know,
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:57.720]   for most uses in this country,
[02:29:57.720 --> 02:29:59.900]   but are certainly people are flying down to Columbia
[02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:00.920]   and getting injections.
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:04.120]   And what is your understanding or experience
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:06.920]   with things like BPC-157 specifically,
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.380]   'cause peptides is a huge landscape,
[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:10.580]   we should probably do a whole episode on peptides,
[02:30:10.580 --> 02:30:14.280]   things like PRP, PRP is now approved for,
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:15.760]   I mean, women are getting injections of this
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:19.360]   into their ovaries to improve follicle count.
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:21.520]   We know this, people are getting injections of PRP
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:23.200]   into every tissue and organ,
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.880]   and hell, men are getting injected into their penis,
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:30.420]   so I hear, for all sorts of reasons that are unclear to me.
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:35.800]   What's the deal with PRP, BPC-157, and stem cells?
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:38.040]   Do you ever see interesting effects?
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:40.840]   Are you curious about these compounds?
[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:43.440]   Do you prescribe or direct people towards these?
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:44.560]   The FDA approved ones, of course.
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:47.560]   - Yeah, so short answer is I'm definitely curious about them
[02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:48.900]   and I'd love to see the work done,
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:51.920]   but I also think this is about as wild, wild west
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:53.040]   as it gets.
[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:57.920]   PRP less so, but certainly stem cells and peptides.
[02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:00.060]   And, you know, I just think,
[02:31:00.060 --> 02:31:04.840]   if you're gonna do something without a clinical trial,
[02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:06.520]   you gotta show up with a lot more data, right?
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:08.600]   So let's use rapamycin as an example, right?
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.240]   I'm a huge proponent of rapamycin,
[02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:12.560]   and you can say, well, Peter, how can you take
[02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:15.840]   or prescribe rapamycin for zero protective effects
[02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:17.560]   when we do not have a human clinical trial
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:19.880]   demonstrating that it lengthens life?
[02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:24.740]   And the answer is because I have 84 other pieces of data
[02:31:24.740 --> 02:31:27.760]   that all point in the same direction
[02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:30.440]   across every model organism going back
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:31.960]   more than a billion years.
[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:37.200]   And that's really different from Joey, Sammy,
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:40.680]   and Sally did this thing, and I think it works.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:43.080]   And they just can't be compared.
[02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:46.220]   Now, I have no idea if stem cells work.
[02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:49.480]   I have no idea if BPC157 works.
[02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:52.620]   I have no idea, frankly, if PRP even works,
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:54.680]   though it might seem to have some efficacy
[02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:55.900]   and some indications.
[02:31:55.900 --> 02:31:59.360]   For example, maybe when it comes to early hair loss,
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:03.640]   maybe when it comes to, you know, certain joint issues.
[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:06.360]   But the reality of it is like,
[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:08.240]   I think we just have to accept the fact
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:11.440]   that everything we do has an opportunity cost,
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:15.020]   and that opportunity cost is sometimes financial,
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:18.480]   but I actually find a lot of times it's in time
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:20.880]   and effort and energy that goes into something.
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:23.560]   Now, when I was, you know,
[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:24.980]   waiting to get my shoulder surgery,
[02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:27.000]   this is an injury that I've had forever, right?
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.640]   This is an injury, you know,
[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:33.080]   this injury was actually probably the greatest source
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:35.640]   of discomfort I had swimming the Catalina Channel
[02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:37.000]   the last time in 2009.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.400]   So that tells you how long I've had this injury.
[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.980]   But, you know, I sort of knew at some point,
[02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:44.100]   like I'm gonna have to have it fixed.
[02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:46.160]   And I sort of went down this rabbit hole like,
[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.560]   hey, is there anything I can do to avoid having surgery?
[02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:52.080]   You know, would infusing a million stem cells into it work?
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:56.400]   And in speaking with as many orthopedic surgeons as I could,
[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:00.040]   the answer was kind of unambiguously no.
[02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:01.740]   And by the way, it doesn't mean you wouldn't feel better
[02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:03.920]   if I injected a bunch of stem cells into your shoulder.
[02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:05.840]   There are a lot of reasons that might make you feel better,
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:07.940]   just like there are a bunch of reasons you can feel better
[02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:10.800]   if somebody injects saline directly into your joint.
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:14.800]   So the question is, is it going to fix the underlying
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:17.480]   problem and if so, will it do so by what mechanism?
[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:21.200]   So I'm pretty sure that if you took 1,000 people
[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:25.040]   with my particular injury and injected them with stem cells,
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:27.760]   it wouldn't do a thing because of the nature of my injury.
[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:29.600]   I had a complete labral tear.
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:33.400]   Are there some injuries that might benefit from it?
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:34.800]   Yeah, possible.
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:37.400]   So the question is, how would you design the trial
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:41.000]   to narrow down your patient population correctly
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.680]   so that you might see a signal?
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.240]   'Cause the other risk of doing a trial is you have too much
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:48.840]   of a heterogeneous patient population.
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:51.040]   You don't know what the heck you're really doing
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:53.120]   and you get meaningless results.
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:55.660]   You get a null result when in fact there's a small signal,
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:57.600]   but you were underpowered to pick it up
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:00.720]   because you only had 10% of your patient population
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:03.220]   that was the right patient population to get that.
[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:05.660]   So will we ever get there?
[02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:08.500]   I don't know because I don't see what the incentive is.
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:11.300]   You have people who are making money hand over fist
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:16.240]   doing procedures on the basis of I'm not sure what,
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:18.500]   what would their motivation or incentive be
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:21.160]   to sort of see this legitimized.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:22.560]   You'd really have to be able to say,
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:25.100]   well, there really needs to be sort of a pharma angle
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:25.940]   to this.
[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:29.180]   It's sort of one of the wishes I had.
[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:33.160]   Like if I was a billionaire, I feel like the way
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:34.980]   I would probably waste all of my money
[02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:36.760]   would be running clinical trials
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.620]   on stuff nobody cared about.
[02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:39.820]   It would just be-- - Likewise.
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:41.680]   I would join you because that would be,
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:45.980]   yesterday we recorded a sit down with somebody from Caltech
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:49.340]   who works on aggression and rage
[02:34:49.340 --> 02:34:50.940]   and other things related to that
[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:54.580]   and has identified peptides that are approved the FDA
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:57.260]   for other reasons that seem to adjust anxiety,
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:00.260]   might even adjust aggression and pathologic aggression
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:02.060]   and went off on to a long description
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:04.220]   of why none of these drugs exist on the market
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:05.640]   for the treatment of psychiatric illness
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:07.960]   and yet probably would work.
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.400]   And what's missing is a billionaire
[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:15.560]   or a billion dollar company that is willing to invest
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:17.720]   in something that very likely will work,
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:20.360]   but the market value isn't quite there
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:22.520]   or it failed in a previous trial
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:25.180]   and so no one wants to touch it with a 10 foot pole.
[02:35:25.180 --> 02:35:27.560]   Hopefully someone listening to this will be incentivized
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:30.400]   to provide this sort of a venue for that,
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.540]   the kind of work that we're talking about.
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:34.480]   I have to ask--
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:35.860]   - But I want to make one other point, Andrew,
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:40.680]   which is to me the problem with a lot of these things
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:43.340]   is it gets, it's a crutch.
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:45.400]   You know, it's sort of like what we talked about with like,
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:47.800]   hey, just fix my T-man and everything's gonna be fine
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:50.360]   and it's like, no, that's just the beginning.
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:52.380]   You know, what I worry about when I see people
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:54.480]   who are clamoring for this stuff
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:56.900]   is a lot of times they don't realize
[02:35:56.900 --> 02:35:59.100]   that whether it's psychologically or otherwise,
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:00.940]   they sort of say, well, now that I've had this thing done,
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:03.120]   I don't have to do the hard work of the real rehab.
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.140]   I mean, if I've learned anything through my shoulder surgery
[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:06.980]   and I'm now three and a half months out.
[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:07.820]   - How does it feel?
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:08.640]   - Amazing.
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:10.580]   I mean, look, I still can't do a lot of stuff.
[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:12.060]   It's gonna be, you know, a while.
[02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:13.860]   I haven't even been able to shoot a bow yet
[02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:17.820]   and it'll probably be a year before I'll go back to,
[02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:19.980]   you know, long dead hangs and heavy dead lifts.
[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:21.240]   I mean, I don't know, maybe nine months,
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:23.300]   but it's, you know, I'm not there yet.
[02:36:23.300 --> 02:36:26.700]   But what I learned through a really amazing
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:30.960]   rehab and rehab process is like,
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:35.100]   you just gotta do the work and it's freaking hard.
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:38.560]   Shoulders are the most tedious, boring thing in the world.
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:41.540]   I mean, three days a week, I am doing,
[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:43.980]   four days a week, I am doing one hour
[02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:47.740]   of just dedicated stuff for this shoulder
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:52.740]   that is super uncomfortable, super boring,
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:57.140]   super frustrating, but I mean,
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:59.540]   I have faith in the methodology, right?
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:01.080]   And I think a lot of people are saying,
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:02.480]   just shoot the stem cells into me
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:03.740]   and I don't have to do any of that stuff.
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.100]   And the reality of it is,
[02:37:05.100 --> 02:37:08.060]   I think that's a very dangerous place to be.
[02:37:08.060 --> 02:37:10.740]   - Have you ever tried BPC-157?
[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:14.180]   - Yeah, we tried it.
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:16.940]   We had, you know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago,
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:18.660]   we had a bunch of patients ask about it.
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:21.220]   So, you know, my view is, okay,
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:23.600]   I was pretty convinced that there was no safety downside
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:25.140]   to it, so I was like, well, I wouldn't prescribe it
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:26.900]   to a patient unless I tried it myself.
[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:29.900]   So me and another doc in the practice, Ralph,
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:32.300]   we did it for, I don't know, a couple of months.
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:34.340]   I didn't notice a single thing.
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:35.500]   - Interesting.
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:36.980]   Well, thank you for that.
[02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.900]   Shifting to a less esoteric,
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:43.500]   and I think probably more important topic overall,
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:45.520]   metabolomics, we're talking about this
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:47.380]   before we set down to record.
[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:50.940]   What is, what are metabolomics?
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:52.940]   Why should we be thinking about them?
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:55.980]   I have some idea of what it might be about,
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:58.340]   but most people, I think, are not thinking
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:01.100]   about metabolomics at all.
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:03.660]   And for those that are, I'm sure they could learn more.
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:05.700]   So tell us about metabolomics and what you'd like
[02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:08.540]   to see more of in the world of metabolomics.
[02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:10.460]   - Yeah, so omics is just the term that we use
[02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:12.520]   to describe the study of something.
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:15.260]   So genomics, right, is like the broad study of genes,
[02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:18.360]   and, you know, proteomics, the broad study of proteins,
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:19.520]   and things like that.
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:22.380]   So metabolomics is the study of metabolites.
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:25.680]   And metabolites, unlike a lot of these other things,
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:28.520]   they're a relatively finite number of these things,
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.760]   many of which are known, but some of which are not known.
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:32.600]   So glucose is a metabolite.
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.100]   Acetyl-CoA is a metabolite.
[02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:35.840]   Lactate is a metabolite.
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.560]   And so the question is, what do we know
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:42.360]   about these things and how they work?
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:44.560]   And more importantly, what do we know
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:46.460]   about certain physiologic states
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:49.400]   and the metabolomic profile that results from them?
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:54.400]   So let's use two extreme examples, like exercise.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.000]   Everybody understands, the data are unambiguously clear,
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.400]   exercise produces about the most
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:03.720]   favorable phenotype imaginable.
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:06.480]   So if you wanted to take a genomics approach
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.900]   to understanding that, you might look at,
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:11.640]   is there a change in the genome when you exercise?
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:13.400]   And the answer is, you know, probably not.
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:15.800]   But maybe if you looked at the, you know,
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:18.200]   methylation patterns and epigenome,
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.040]   you could look at epigenomic studies.
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:22.700]   But you might instead look at kind of
[02:39:22.700 --> 02:39:24.000]   the proteomic side of that.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.640]   Like, what is gene expression doing?
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:28.620]   And there you would see a lot of changes.
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:30.320]   Well, what I don't think people are really understanding,
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:31.880]   although there was a very interesting paper
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:35.120]   that just came out two weeks ago
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.960]   that looks for novel metabolites that are changing.
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:44.500]   Is there a huge signal in a metabolomic profile
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:46.400]   that looks different in the state
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:48.520]   of exercise versus non-exercise?
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.400]   And could that represent part of how exercise
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:54.640]   is transmitting its benefit through the body?
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:57.960]   You know, people always talk about the holy grail
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:00.300]   of metabolomics would be, can you find a pill
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:02.080]   to mimic exercise?
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:03.120]   And I think the answer to that question
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:07.080]   is going to be undoubtedly no, for a couple reasons.
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:10.400]   One, even if you could mimic the longevity,
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:12.100]   sort of lifespan parts of it,
[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:14.960]   you could never mimic the healthspan parts of it.
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:16.520]   But what if you could do both, right?
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:18.680]   What if there were small molecules
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:21.440]   that can replicate some of the protective benefits
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:23.980]   of exercise and you could combine those with exercise?
[02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:25.500]   What if those could be treatments
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:28.640]   for other disease states like diabetes, things like that?
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:30.400]   So that's why I think this field of metabolomics
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:35.400]   is relatively untapped and I think,
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.260]   potentially the next sort of frontier.
[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:40.240]   - Speaking of frontiers, I hear a lot nowadays
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.240]   about GLP-1 and pharmacology, prescription drugs
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:48.960]   that mimic or increase GLP-1 directly.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:53.480]   Glucagon-like peptide, people are talking about this
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:55.720]   as the blockbuster obesity drug.
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:57.540]   I haven't heard this much talk about a drug
[02:40:57.540 --> 02:41:01.200]   to adjust human body weight favorably
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:04.000]   since the discussions of Fen-Phen when I was in college.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.400]   And then of course, Fen-Phen was pulled from the market
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:09.160]   because people were dying, not left and right,
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:11.280]   but enough people died that they pulled it from the market.
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.140]   - Which by the way, is an interesting story.
[02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:17.040]   It was the enantiomer that they chose to use
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:18.700]   that was the wrong enantiomer.
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:23.080]   And what it resulted in was, God, I think it was like--
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:24.960]   - So mitral valve, prolapse.
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:28.600]   - It was an MVP, yeah, it was something in the mitral valve.
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:30.640]   Yeah, I think the chordae tendineae were rupturing
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:34.120]   in the mitral valve and it was mostly young women
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:36.600]   I think were getting horrible pulmonary disease
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:38.880]   as a result of it, probably pulmonary hypertension
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.040]   or something like that.
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:43.900]   But there were two enantiomers of the drug
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:45.820]   and had they just used the other one,
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:47.220]   this issue wouldn't have happened
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:49.600]   and there was a stupid reason why they made the choice
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:51.200]   to use the one they did.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:52.920]   And it's one of those things where once you make the mistake
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:53.760]   you're never going back.
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:54.920]   It's not like that company could say,
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:56.320]   okay, we wanna do over,
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:57.920]   but we're gonna do it with the right version.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:00.720]   So it's a tragic outcome.
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:01.960]   But you're absolutely right.
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:05.440]   I think the GLP-1 agonists have more efficacy
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:10.400]   and for all intensity and for everything we can see
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:11.760]   certainly seem safer.
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.000]   - Are you excited about them?
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:13.840]   - Yeah, I am, yeah.
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:15.160]   I mean, I think we're just seeing
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:16.880]   the kind of tip of the iceberg.
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:18.500]   They're not miracle drugs, right?
[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:19.820]   They come with problems, right?
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:23.620]   Which is, they're catabolic across the board.
[02:42:23.620 --> 02:42:25.680]   So patients are losing fat,
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:27.560]   but they're losing muscle as well.
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:28.400]   So--
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:31.560]   - You just sent all the Jim jockeys running
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:34.800]   from semaglutinol, that's all you have to say.
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:36.640]   All you have to say nowadays about something
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:40.020]   is that it's gonna drop testosterone, lower fertility,
[02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:41.840]   change someone's skin, hair, or nails.
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:43.680]   And it's like people,
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:46.120]   it could extend life to being 250 years old
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:47.800]   and people are gone.
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:49.080]   Humans are humans.
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:51.080]   That's a neuroscience and psychology issue,
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.000]   not a biology medicine issue.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.160]   But I'm pleased to hear that you're excited by them
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:58.040]   'cause I hear a lot of excitement.
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:01.320]   I haven't heard anything disastrous about them.
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:03.400]   - It takes a while to get people up to dose.
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:05.240]   So if you're looking at semaglutide,
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:07.220]   the dose that was studied,
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:09.600]   so they did a one year trial,
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:11.760]   or maybe it was a little over that, maybe 60 weeks.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:15.700]   But it took about 16 weeks to get the patients comfortably
[02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:17.460]   up to 2.4 milligrams weekly,
[02:43:17.460 --> 02:43:20.120]   which was the dose that they ultimately stayed on.
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:21.840]   In our experience, when we use it,
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:24.160]   we don't even usually go up to 2.4 milligrams.
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:25.240]   We can usually get enough benefit
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:26.840]   between one and two milligrams.
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:28.960]   And we usually move people along a little bit quicker,
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:30.940]   but we've definitely had our share of patients
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:32.800]   who can't tolerate it due to the nausea.
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:33.640]   - Interesting.
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.760]   - Which might be part of how it's working, right?
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:37.980]   Is sort of suppression of appetite,
[02:43:37.980 --> 02:43:41.220]   which if taken to an extreme can produce nausea.
[02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:42.060]   - Interesting.
[02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:44.100]   - Yeah, I think most of the effect of semaglutide
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:45.760]   is central, not peripheral.
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:47.560]   - Huh, so I don't know.
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:52.560]   I saw one paper that GLP-1 is acting both on cells
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:57.700]   in the periphery to cause gut distension in some ways,
[02:43:57.700 --> 02:43:59.640]   or sort of make people feel full
[02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:03.320]   through promotion of literally mechanoreceptors
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:05.520]   that make people feel as if their stomach is distended,
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:06.760]   even though their stomach is empty,
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:09.080]   and then perhaps some central hypothalamic effects.
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:09.920]   Is that what you think?
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:11.360]   - Yeah, I think it's doing,
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:14.080]   I would bet 80% of it's in the hypothalamus.
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:18.140]   It is also improving insulin sensitivity in the periphery,
[02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:20.040]   but I don't think that that's accounting
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:22.040]   for much of its benefit.
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:22.880]   - Super interesting.
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:25.960]   - And there's next gen versions of these
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:27.480]   that seem to be more long lasting.
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.060]   So right now, if you look at coming off semaglutide,
[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:32.880]   you're going to see a weight regain.
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:34.560]   So there's newer versions
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:38.240]   that seem to preserve the weight loss, even off the drug.
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:39.880]   So it begs the ultimate question, which is like,
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:42.200]   what's the total use case for this going to be?
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:44.540]   Is this going to be a drug you cycle on and off?
[02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:45.440]   Or is it going to be a drug
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:47.080]   that a person has to stay on indefinitely?
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:48.860]   And if so, will they become tachyphylactic?
[02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:51.680]   Will they gain a resistance to it?
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:54.200]   So it's still super early days on these things.
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:55.920]   - My hope is that it would be a little bit like
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:57.400]   the way that you described testosterone
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:58.260]   and estrogen therapies,
[02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:00.960]   that it would allow people to do more of the behavioral work
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:04.360]   that's absolutely required for healthspan and lifespan.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:07.240]   - Yep, and we've also seen on the flip side of that,
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:11.240]   you can cheat through semaglutide, right?
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:13.920]   People who, you know, you can drink a lot of calories
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:17.280]   and sort of get around the drug.
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:19.680]   So, you know, for example, like, you know,
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:21.740]   we always encourage patients who want to lose weight
[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:23.160]   to really just eliminate alcohol.
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:24.760]   Like that's like, that's the cheapest,
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:27.800]   easiest trick to lose weight.
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:30.200]   And so if you're still drinking a lot of alcohol,
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:32.000]   which is incredibly caloric,
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.480]   and just drinking a lot of caloric stuff,
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:37.560]   we've seen that that's less,
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:39.640]   this is just anecdotal with our patients,
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:41.360]   but we've seen that that's,
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:45.720]   it's easier to get around the benefits of the drug that way.
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:47.240]   - Interesting.
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:49.260]   I so appreciate your answers today.
[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:51.880]   First of all, they were incredibly thorough
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:54.920]   and pointed towards real world application.
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:58.080]   I also just want to thank you more broadly
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:45:59.640]   for the work that you do,
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:02.240]   because obviously you have this incredible
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:04.560]   clinical experience and patient population
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:06.020]   that you work very closely with.
[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:08.480]   But I see you really as one of the few,
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:13.040]   both clinicians, and I realize you're an MD.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:14.160]   Did you do a PhD as well?
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:17.480]   No, but I consider you a scientist clinician.
[02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:19.400]   Clinician scientist is the appropriate wording
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:22.160]   of that, of course, in the way that you really
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:24.140]   still drill into studies in detail.
[02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:25.160]   I know a lot of clinicians,
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:28.320]   not all of them do that for sure.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:29.600]   And the fact that you're so hungry
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:31.280]   for the new incoming knowledge,
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:33.000]   as well as the old literature.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.020]   So it's an incredibly rich data set in that brain of yours.
[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:39.360]   And I really appreciate you sharing it with us,
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.960]   both in your podcast, in the upcoming book,
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:45.680]   which I think that we'll certainly have you on here again
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:46.640]   in anticipation of that.
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:48.640]   But I know I and a ton of other people
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:50.320]   are really excited for the book
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:52.200]   and in the way that you approach social media
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:54.580]   and podcasts and going on podcasts.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:55.560]   Thank you so much.
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:56.400]   I learned a ton.
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:58.360]   I know everyone learned a ton.
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:46:59.200]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:00.240]   Great to be here, man.
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:01.080]   - Thank you.
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:02.460]   - Thank you for joining me today for my discussion
[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:04.000]   with Dr. Peter Attia,
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.800]   all about the things that we can do
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:09.280]   in order to maximize our lifespan and health span.
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:11.960]   I highly recommend people check out Dr. Attia's podcast,
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:12.800]   "The Drive."
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:15.420]   It is excellent, as you can imagine,
[02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:16.800]   based on today's conversation.
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:19.160]   And it's easily available on Apple Podcasts,

[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.160]   We are @hubermanlab on Twitter,
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:22.200]   and we are also @hubermanlab on Instagram.
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:25.520]   In both places, I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:27.080]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:28.240]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:30.820]   but much of which is unique from the content covered
[02:48:30.820 --> 02:48:32.000]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.700]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:35.360]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:38.240]   Please also check out our Neural Network monthly newsletter.
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:41.760]   This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.

[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.080]   It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.240]   You go to hubermanlab.com, click on the menu,
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:50.320]   go to newsletter, you supply your email,

[02:48:57.440 --> 02:48:59.940]   And the newsletter comes out once a month,
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:01.480]   and it is completely zero cost.
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:03.500]   Again, just go to hubermanlab.com
[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:05.960]   and go to the Neural Network newsletter.
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:08.280]   I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.800]   has a clips channel, so these are brief clips,
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:13.840]   anywhere from three to 10 minutes,
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.400]   that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:19.300]   related to sleep, to focus,
[02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:20.560]   interviews with various guests.
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:21.960]   We talk about things like caffeine,
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:24.400]   when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:25.660]   alcohol, when and how,
[02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:28.780]   and if anyone should ingest it relative to sleep,
[02:49:28.780 --> 02:49:31.380]   dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health,
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:33.360]   and on and on, all the things that relate
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:35.600]   to the topics most of interest to you.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.260]   You can find that easily by going to YouTube,
[02:49:38.260 --> 02:49:41.160]   look for Huberman Lab Clips in the search area,
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:42.000]   and it will take you there.
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.380]   Subscribe, and we are constantly updating those
[02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:45.220]   with new clips.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:46.640]   This is especially useful, I believe,
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:48.640]   for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:50.260]   or you're still working through the back catalog
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:51.340]   of Huberman Lab Podcasts,
[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:53.460]   which admittedly can be rather long.
[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:55.760]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:57.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:00.200]   [upbeat music]
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:02.780]   (upbeat music)
