[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   We open the week with two episodes with a guest, a friend of ours, Dr. John M. Frame,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.180]   who is the J.D. Trimble Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy at Reform Theological
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.920]   Seminary in Orlando. Dr. Frame has published more words in his lifetime than most of us
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.960]   will read in our lifetimes, and we get him for two days, and no doubt he's going to hit
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.280]   these out of the park. Thank you for joining us, Dr. Frame.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.440]   Well, I'm not a radio personality, and I'm not sure that I'll hit anything out of the
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.640]   park. Stop it. Just stop it. Tomorrow, I have a
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920]   question for you on literature, so we're leading up to that. But first, you have an outstanding
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.440]   book coming out soon. It's called A History of Western Philosophy and Theology, and it
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.560]   releases in mid-November from PNR. It's one of the most important books of 2015, I think.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.160]   In the book, under the section titled Antithesis in Epistemology, you write this, quote, "We
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.020]   know God and the world because he has taken the initiative to reveal himself. Otherwise,
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:12.800]   we could have no knowledge at all," end quote. Riff on this enormous reality for us for a
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.720]   few minutes. Fundamentally, how is all knowledge tied to God revealing himself?
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.280]   Well, God, first of all, is somebody who knows himself, the knowledge of the Father and the
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.720]   Son and the Spirit and the Holy Trinity for all eternity. And so when God makes a world,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.040]   he knows that world perfectly well, because this is a world that he has planned, this
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.680]   is a world that he has created, this is a world that he has complete control over, and
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.280]   so he knows everything that there is to know in the world. Now, when he creates a creature
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.600]   that is also capable of knowing, he creates angels, he creates human beings, human beings
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.720]   are capable of knowing him in return. So the Bible says that God created Adam in the image
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.160]   of God, which includes the fact that just as God knows the world, so in a smaller sense,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.360]   Adam knows the world. But of course, Adam couldn't know anything unless God had made
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.640]   him so that he's able to know. And so as Adam goes through the world, he looks at the trees,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.600]   he looks at the ground and the rocks and the sky and everything that there is, and he's
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.520]   always looking at things that God has made, he's looking at things that God has known
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:59.160]   beforehand. And so Adam's job is to understand that world. Of course, God gave him the responsibility
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.840]   to keep the garden and to guard it and to till it, and for that, of course, Adam needs
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.360]   to gain knowledge of the world, but it's a knowledge that echoes God's own knowledge.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.440]   It's a secondary knowledge, it's a knowledge of God's knowledge, if you will. So from the
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   very beginning, Adam is working according to God's revelation. His knowledge is the
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.240]   knowledge that God has permitted him to have, and it's the knowledge of the world that God
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.560]   has made. So we talk about how Adam's thoughts, thinking God's thoughts after him. And so
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.560]   that's the way we all are now. Of course, the fall has messed us up in that regard because
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:57.880]   we suppress the truth, as Romans 1 says, but our job, if we're functioning rightly, is
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.640]   to think God's thoughts after him, to come to know the world in a way that's analogous
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.520]   to God's own knowledge of the world. And when God repairs our minds, repairs our hearts
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.480]   as part of redemption in Christ, then we begin again to think God's thoughts after him. We
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   begin to think in a smaller way of the great thoughts that God had when he first created
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   the world.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.440]   Fascinating, that's so true. Okay, now this leads me to ask a question that has been on
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.660]   my mind for a long time, especially how do non-Christian novelists who obviously suppress
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.960]   the truth in unrighteousness, how do they know so much about the human condition and
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.760]   so much about what is true and good and beautiful? That's the question I want to ask tomorrow
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.160]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast with guest John Frame. Dr. Frame and I will be back tomorrow.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.200]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
