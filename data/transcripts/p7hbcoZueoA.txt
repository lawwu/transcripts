[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Somehow, we could talk about how, it's not a coincidence,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   you became synonymous with foam rolling.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.000]   - Worst part of my life.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   - It became synonymous with you.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   That's okay.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   I mean, it's not okay, but it's okay with me.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.760]   They weren't saying about me,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.040]   but I was about to say it's okay.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.880]   You know, anytime somebody goes public facing
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.000]   and starts to try and educate people, you know,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.160]   there's certain things that are sticky.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.320]   They have like high salience.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.480]   Like, yes, I like to get into a cold plunge,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.320]   but how I, how Andrew Huberman became associated
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.280]   with cold plunging or buying a cold plunge is wild.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.720]   I mean, sure, I own one and, you know, this sort of thing.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.440]   And I think they're great for shifting your state,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.400]   but it's hardly the cornerstone of my life or my existence,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.240]   but I love it.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.880]   I use it, but I think foam rolling,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.840]   I think looked different enough
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.680]   from what people had not seen before.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.440]   And it, you know, these things just,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.960]   they have a stickiness to them.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   Who knows why?
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.400]   What is the deal with foam rolling?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.680]   Is there a utility to foam rolling?
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.720]   - Is there a wrong way to do it?
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.160]   - No, but there's a way that's not a great use of your time.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.000]   - Okay. - Right?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600]   So what we're all looking at is,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.120]   we have a finite amount of time.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.200]   And what's my goal?
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.520]   To quickly touch my whole body?
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.680]   You know, what are we trying to do?
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.600]   So if I was using soft tissue mobilization
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.800]   and or using a roller or a ball or something,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.400]   what's my goal here?
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.640]   Well, I think, and the research is very clear,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.400]   it can help with pain, it can restore range of motion.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.440]   Again, very clear.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.600]   And I want to point out sort of one of my research friends,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.720]   Brent Brookbush,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.960]   the Brookbush Institute has incredible summaries
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.120]   of musculoskeletal care.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   Brent is a genius.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.200]   And if you go on his site, there's a little hourglass
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.920]   and you can search like sugar points
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.840]   and you'll see all of the deep dive research,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.360]   analysis of the meta research.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.080]   Like you'll be like, okay, this is really excellent.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.720]   And it is tricky because, you know,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.000]   what doesn't work for my body
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.080]   or wasn't a good use for time now is useless
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.640]   and it's easy to shout on the internet.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.800]   So what's our goal?
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.760]   If I was in pain and I was about to exercise,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.720]   a quick two or three minute intervention working on,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.600]   let's call it desensitization of the tissues,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   let's be mechanism agnostic for a second
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.440]   and say that's a really low level to entry safe,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.480]   highly effective way for you to suddenly feel better.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   So we create a window of opportunity to move.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.360]   That's really cool.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.200]   I love that.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.800]   No physical therapists in the room.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960]   No one went blind.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.000]   You didn't dislocate, right?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.800]   So that could be a really excellent use
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.840]   of some soft tissue work.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.040]   The same way a boxer would go or an MMA fighter
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.000]   or the Olympic lifters in China,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960]   they have people who are giving non-threatening input
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.000]   to the body to tell the brain it's safe
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.360]   or to rehydrate something or get some,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.320]   again, is it just stimulus
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.800]   so that the brain says it's safe?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.760]   Sure.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400]   Are we restoring how the tissues slide and glide?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   Sure.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.560]   A lot of times I think if you look at
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.840]   any of the mobility work, I'll just put writ large,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.040]   really comes down to just doing a couple things.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.120]   Most of them are just isometrics.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.040]   So we have a lot of isometrics,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.120]   which everyone can agree is good stuff.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.840]   And we do a lot of tempo work.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.600]   That's really just moving slowly through range.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.560]   It just may be that I'm using a different tool
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.920]   to have that isometric stimulus
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   or that tempo moving slowly stimulus.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120]   So we like to say, hey, let's use mobilizations,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.400]   mobilizing the tissues.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.240]   Why are we doing it?
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   What are we trying to do?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.560]   Well, pain is a good reason.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.200]   And again, multifactorial, highly subjective.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.040]   Why do I have pain?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.560]   Well, I got in a fight with my wife and I didn't eat
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.280]   and I twisted my knee back in Vietnam.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.200]   And who knows, right?
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.360]   But what are the inputs that I have
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.800]   to self-soothe and desensitize?
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.040]   And it turns out a ball and a roller is a really good one.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.920]   So I can use those to help myself feel better.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.120]   Did that solve the problem?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.480]   Did that solve two weeks of shitty sleep?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.840]   Did that solve my poor nutrition and lack of fiber?
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.680]   Did that solve the fact that I don't feel safe
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.520]   in this environment?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.720]   No, but it got me a window of opportunity
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.680]   where I can go feel better in my body.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.640]   Is anyone against that?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.800]   No, okay.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.560]   So what we can also say is, hey,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.280]   this would be a great way to do what?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.600]   Restore your range of motion.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.000]   A one tool in a system of tools to get you to do what?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.040]   Have normative range again, right?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.360]   For whatever reason, your lats are super stiff.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.320]   Your doesn't, again, it's more complicated than that,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.000]   but sometimes it's not more complicated than that.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   And if I just get you getting some input into there,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.760]   maybe we can restore that range of motion
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.160]   or create a window where you can go use it again.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.600]   Lastly, I would say is that it's a wonderful tool
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.720]   to decrease DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.240]   So in the evening, you blow out your quads,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.360]   do a little soft tissue work.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.120]   And what you'll see is maybe that's blood flow.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.400]   Maybe it's non-threatening input.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.360]   Maybe it's just massage.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.560]   Maybe it's just the parasympathetic input
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.640]   that massage has.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.680]   Touch, right, just down regulates.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.520]   Maybe those are the reasons I feel better.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.680]   But the bottom line is, is that a good use of your time?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.640]   Yes.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   Are all techniques on the road the same?
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.880]   No, right?
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   And I think that's where we've lost our minds
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.360]   is that if you just rolled up and down on your calf,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.200]   didn't do anything.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.880]   It's like, yeah, well, you just, what are you doing, right?
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.360]   What if I rolled side to side?
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.720]   And so suddenly we can start to layer
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.480]   in some really complex thinking around this.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320]   How about this?
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.920]   You have a roller out and I put my calf on there
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.800]   and I start rolling side to side.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.360]   Should that be uncomfortable?
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.960]   I'm guessing you're going to say no,
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.840]   but anytime I've used a roller,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   anytime I've used a roller, I'm like, man, that hurts.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.360]   I don't like it, that sucks.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.640]   Well, I mean, I don't mind it.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.560]   Like, it's not like the kind of,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.200]   it's not like level eight pain or anything.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.760]   It's just, it's sort of like, it feels very localized.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.240]   Even if the roller is a big fat Costello
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.960]   the Bulldog size roller,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.880]   it feels like someone's kind of kneading down
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.240]   in between my muscle fibers.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.080]   And then I started to think
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.280]   maybe I just have like low fiber density.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.000]   And if I were Mark Bell or something,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.560]   then this would feel comfortable.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.520]   But, you know, I always feel like the roller
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.640]   is going down to the bone.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.880]   - The base of LFD, low fiber density.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.240]   So, you know, what I think we can do
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.600]   is let's establish some guidelines for people.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.200]   'Cause this is one of the ways
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.360]   that we can feel better in our home,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.960]   without bourbon, without ibuprofen, without THC.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.240]   Like we need to give people some tools
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.960]   that don't, like that aren't just--
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   - Without having to buy a sauna.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   If you can afford one, great, but not every--
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.600]   I mean, this whole thing with sauna, love saunas, but--
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.440]   - Doesn't scare you.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.240]   - Well, until very recently in my life,
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.000]   I couldn't afford a sauna, until very recently.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.760]   You know, even as a tenured professor at Stanford,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.640]   I'll just say that, right?
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.200]   - You can actually be angry at your parents
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.680]   for not giving you a sauna.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.760]   - No, you know, when I was a kid,
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.720]   my dad and I used to go to the Y in the evening sometimes,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.320]   or I was little, and I'd shoot baskets,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.200]   or he would lift weights, Nautilus machines back then.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.040]   - Yeah.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.860]   - And then--
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.700]   - Get brutally big on us.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.880]   - And then we'd sit in the sauna,
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.720]   or there was a hot tub or something.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.160]   - And you had a different set of trauma,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.240]   traumatic experience of sitting in the sauna at the Y.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.800]   - No, actually, I learned how--
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.640]   I learned how--
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.480]   - How to make eye contact.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   - I learned how men over 40 spoke in 1985.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.060]   - There you go.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.900]   - There you go.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.880]   - There you go.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   If everyone had a roller and a ball,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.360]   there's a lot of dysfunction and discomfort we can manage.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.680]   If you push on a tissue,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.240]   we expect that tissue to be painless to compression,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.120]   or not uncomfortable to compression.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.660]   Again, pain is a weird word, I don't want to set that up,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.640]   but you shouldn't be uncomfortable to compression.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.800]   What's nice is that if I push on something,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.720]   all I'm doing is just creating an isometric.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.080]   It's just a vector isometric.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.360]   Instead of pulling an isometric
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.280]   through the length of the tissue,
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.840]   I'm putting it at a different vector and angle.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.800]   So that would just be one.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.840]   I could start there, and if it was uncomfortable,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.680]   well, guess what?
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.040]   Now I can get my nervous system involved.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.800]   So I can teach my brain
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.700]   that it's safe to create a contraction here.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.540]   So what do I do?
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.920]   Just flex, flex it, hold it for four seconds.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.240]   - This is very basic, I realize,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.900]   but for many people, they're either already foam rolling
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.140]   and doing it incorrectly, or they're not foam rolling,
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.500]   and we want them to do it correctly.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.700]   So if I understand correctly,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.580]   it's "okay" to flex the muscle
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.660]   that you have in contact with the foam roller
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.500]   while you're rolling.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.820]   - If I find something that's uncomfortable, or stiff,
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.620]   or doesn't feel like my other side,
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.580]   I'm going to stop.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.380]   I found a place to work.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.900]   I'm going to build, take a big inhale.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.960]   So I take a four second inhale.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.720]   I want to teach myself
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.000]   that I need to be able to breathe in this position.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.080]   One of my friends, Greg Cook, is like,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.280]   "If you can't breathe in a position,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.600]   "you don't own a position."
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.880]   You know, that sounds very Iyengar, too.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.900]   But what we're going to do is we're going to say,
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.280]   "It's okay to breathe here, and I'm going to contract here."
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720]   And then I'm going to slowly relax and soften.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.960]   That's tempo that's moving slowly,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.560]   and I can handle higher loads.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   And what'll end up happening
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.080]   is if I repeat that cycle two or three times, guess what?
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.720]   My brain desensitizes that.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.800]   Changes range of motion.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.600]   My brain suddenly is like, "That's not a problem anymore."
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   So we just move on.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.120]   And in two or three cycles of that contraction,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.760]   breath hold, long exhale that starts to sound familiar,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.360]   right, how do I calm down, long exhales?
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.800]   I'm not trying to spin up.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.480]   I'm trying to say, "This is safe."
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.720]   I've done that with my breath.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.240]   I've done that with contraction.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.120]   I'm just getting input in, just touch to my body,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.880]   especially on parts that maybe don't bark at me very often.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.760]   People are shocked to learn
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.360]   that sometimes when they have knee pain,
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.080]   how stiff their quads are.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.400]   And then we can test it, load it, feel it, palpate it.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.040]   And I'm like, "Those things are just stiff."
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.800]   And when we un-stiffen them,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.280]   whatever technique you want to use,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.640]   restore sliding surfaces, get neural input in there.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.000]   We create range of motion.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.400]   Suddenly we change a motion dynamic, improve deficiency.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.280]   The brain says, "Hey, that's no longer a threat,"
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.160]   or we're experiencing that as a new pattern or position,
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.560]   that'd be enough to reduce your pain.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.000]   But pain isn't the only reason we're mobilizing.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   We're mobilizing so that we can reduce session costs,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.720]   so we can work out harder the next day
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.320]   and keep an eye on our minimums of our range of motion.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.160]   - Love this.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.720]   And another just very basic question,
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.560]   'cause I'll be honest,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.480]   I haven't foam rolled much in my life.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.000]   - And it doesn't have to be a big foam roller, everyone.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.520]   Sometimes those big white, those are pool noodles, right?
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.360]   That's what it was for.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.920]   I think like made in Killeen, Texas
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.320]   as like a manufacturing by-product.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.240]   And someone's like, "We could put these in the pool."
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   And then some physical therapist was like, "Sweet."
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.200]   Like that thing's way too big and too hard
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.160]   and too square and too soft.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.920]   Like there's a whole bunch of things.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.120]   Like sometimes you need an elbow.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.200]   Sometimes you need a forearm.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.520]   Sometimes you need a thumb.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.320]   So you can have much smaller diameter.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.520]   I'm a much bigger fan of smaller diameter rollers.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.440]   I just think they fit your body better.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.880]   (upbeat music)
