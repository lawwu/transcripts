[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.200]   We open a new week with a leadership question, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.160]   Does 1 Timothy 2.12 leave open the possibility
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160]   that women are permitted to preach
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.320]   in the weekly gathering of a local church
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.600]   as an extension of the male elders of the church
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.600]   or as an expression under their governing authority?
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.200]   For example, is the wife of a pastor free to preach
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.480]   on Sunday morning?
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.080]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.160]   Well, I don't wanna assume that any of our listeners
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.600]   have all the biblical foundations in place
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.680]   for doing this kind of refined application thinking.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.960]   So let me put a few things in place
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.560]   and then I'll specifically answer the question.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.240]   Here's the text that we're talking about.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.360]   1 Timothy 2.11-14.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.400]   Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.740]   I do not permit a woman to teach
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.520]   or to exercise authority over a man.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.600]   Rather, she is to remain quiet.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.720]   For Adam was formed first, then Eve,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.160]   and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.600]   and became a transgressor.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.240]   So let me work backward in that text
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.360]   toward my answer to the question.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.440]   And I would remind the listeners
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440]   that every one of these comments raises more questions.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.920]   So there is a book, little book,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   called "50 Crucial Questions About Manhood and Womanhood"
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.180]   that Wayne Goodman and I did.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.400]   And it's free online at DesiringGod.pdf.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.080]   And if you have more questions,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.880]   I hope they're answered there.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.080]   At least some of them will be, I hope.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.920]   So Paul gives two reasons,
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.320]   and they're not the only ones,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   for why he would limit the teaching and governing office
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.880]   of the church to spiritually qualified men.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.720]   Reason number one, verse 13.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.320]   Adam was formed first, then Eve.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.160]   This is shorthand for about eight to 10 pointers
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.800]   in Genesis 1-3 that God intended the man
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.560]   to bear a unique responsibility,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.120]   not sole responsibility,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.160]   but unique and special responsibility
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.920]   for leadership in relation to women.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.840]   That man was created first is one of those
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   eight to 10 pointers,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.440]   and in a sense symbolizes all the others.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.120]   You are there first,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.080]   you bear first responsibility to lead, protect,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.360]   especially when it comes to attacks from outside,
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.520]   which was just about to happen in chapter three
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.960]   as Satan approaches the couple,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.600]   who will take up responsibility to be the protector
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.040]   and the spokesman here,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.680]   and give leadership in the face of this kind of opposition.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.960]   So that's number one.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.200]   Adam was formed first, then Eve.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Second argument he gives is based on
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.240]   that order being ignored,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.760]   namely when Satan comes,
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440]   and it appears that both Adam and Eve are present.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's pretty plain in the text in chapter three,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.320]   verse six of Genesis.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.000]   Adam and Eve ignored that order,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.440]   and Paul says, "Adam was not deceived,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.760]   "but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor."
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.520]   What does that mean?
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.880]   There's a sense in which Adam was deceived.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.360]   He did eat.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   In fact, when Paul treats the fall of man in Romans five,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.000]   he lays the guilt entirely on Adam,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   never even mentioning Eve as the guilty party here.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.960]   So my understanding is not that Paul is drawing attention
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.440]   to a woman's greater gullibility,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.800]   although in reality,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   I would say men are more gullible in some things
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.040]   and women are more gullible in some things.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.600]   Lots of studies have been done
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.160]   on the kinds of advertising that draw men in
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.920]   and the kind that draw women in,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.880]   and we are all differently gullible,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.320]   and so I don't want to be naive
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.840]   and say we're exactly the same in our gullibility,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.040]   but I'm not sure that's the focus of Paul here.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.920]   The main point is the reason she was deceived
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.400]   is that the deceiver lured her and Adam
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.600]   to switch places that God had appointed.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.240]   It's as if the general and the colonel,
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.080]   the man and the woman,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   the general and the colonel rode up to the enemy together,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.600]   and the enemy utterly ignored the general,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.200]   spoke directly to the colonel,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.800]   and they both, the general and the colonel, let it happen.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.880]   So Genesis 3:6 says that the man was with Eve
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.680]   while the enemy was talking to her.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.400]   Quote, "She took of its fruit and ate,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   "and she gave some to her husband
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.040]   "who was with her, and he ate."
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.960]   So Satan's first assault
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.760]   was on the order that God had appointed,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.680]   and both Adam and Eve at that moment were duped.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.880]   They let it happen.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   And when Paul says Adam was not deceived,
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.400]   but the woman was deceived,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.840]   he's saying Satan undermined the order of creation
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.560]   and focused his deceptive words on Eve
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   and made her the spokesman, not Adam,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.080]   and she became the focus of the deception, not Adam.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.160]   Adam failed in his leadership,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.680]   and she was willing to take it up,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   and the result was the fall and all of its consequences.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.520]   So from those two arguments in this text,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.840]   Paul draws the conclusion in verse 12,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.880]   "I do not permit a woman to teach
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.800]   "or to exercise authority over a man."
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.360]   In other words, there's an order
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.240]   of how men and women are to relate to each other.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.880]   Rather, she is to remain quiet.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   And those two words, "teach" and "have authority,"
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.040]   are the very two differences
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.280]   between a deacon and an elder in the local church,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.920]   as Paul describes them
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.840]   in the list of responsibilities in chapter three.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.840]   Elders are to govern well,
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.020]   and they are to be apt to teach.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.040]   The deacons aren't supposed to be either of those,
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.740]   and therefore I take verse 12 to mean,
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.900]   "I don't permit a woman to assume the role
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.100]   "of an elder in the church,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.240]   "to act the role of an elder."
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.420]   Whether you call them elders doesn't matter.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.080]   It's the acting of the role of the elder in the church,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.680]   since they are the ones charged
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.680]   with the responsibility of authoritative teaching.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.640]   And of course, not all teaching is inappropriate for women.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   Titus 2.3, she is to teach the younger women, for example.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.840]   But the kind of teaching that belongs to the eldership,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.000]   namely the teaching that carries authority over men,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.160]   is what Paul thinks would compromise God's order.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.560]   And that's the issue, not competency.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.320]   Don't ever make the mistake of thinking,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.180]   "Oh, a woman is not permitted
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.340]   "to do this kind of authoritative teaching
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.600]   "because she's incompetent."
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.120]   That's not the issue.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.800]   The issue is that it would compromise
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.360]   the way men and women are supposed to relate to each other.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.260]   So my answer to the question is, okay,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.080]   all that to put in place.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.800]   The question, here's the question,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.320]   let me remind the listener.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   Does 1 Timothy 2.12 leave open the possibility
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.460]   that women are permitted to preach
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.400]   in the weekly gathering of the local church
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.680]   as an extension or under the governing authority
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.920]   of the male elders of the church?
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.120]   And my answer is no.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.660]   Neither of those qualifications,
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.760]   that is, an extension of,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.120]   or under the governing authority of,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.880]   overrides the teaching of verse 12.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.600]   Paul would say a female
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.140]   is not a proper extension of male leadership.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.920]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.160]   That's a contradiction of male leadership,
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.380]   not an extension of male leadership.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.380]   And a woman teaching men with authority,
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.960]   week in, week out, or every other week,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.600]   or regularly in an adult Sunday school class,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.560]   or whatever, a woman teaching men with authority
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.160]   under the elders is not under the authority
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.980]   of the New Testament.
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.640]   She may be under the authority of the elders,
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.520]   but she's not under the authority of the New Testament,
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.340]   and neither would they be
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.680]   for putting her in that situation.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.560]   So I would conclude no,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.240]   that is inappropriate for churches to do that.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.640]   God loves his church.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.900]   He loves men and women.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.480]   He loves to see all of us flourish
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.220]   in the use of our gifts.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.940]   No man or woman should sit on the sidelines
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.840]   of Christian ministry.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.480]   Let that be plain.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.320]   No woman, no man sits on the sidelines
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.880]   in Christian ministry.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.340]   The question is not whether all men and women
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.740]   should be active in ministry.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.860]   They should.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.560]   The only question is how.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.300]   Amen.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.880]   Women must be ministers.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.040]   In fact, the world needs women ministers.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.320]   That was the title of episode number 388
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.040]   in this podcast series.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.720]   And as Pastor John mentioned earlier,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.800]   you can download the book,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.220]   50 Crucial Questions About Manhood and Womanhood,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.160]   right now at desiringgod.org.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.220]   Click on the books tab at the top of the screen
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.680]   and look for the title,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.480]   which begins with the number 50, five zero,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.680]   and that I think makes it the first title on the page.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.240]   Tomorrow I ask Pastor John a preaching question
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.400]   about whether or not his theology of Christian hedonism
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.440]   drives his exegesis of scripture.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.080]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.640]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   (silence)
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.120]   (silence)
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:17.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
