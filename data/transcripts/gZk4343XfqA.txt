[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.780]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.060]   As you know, if you've been listening for a while,
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.300]   we get heartbreaking emails regularly,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.160]   and that includes this one from an anonymous woman.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.840]   "Pastor John, I am a new widow,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.140]   "mother of two young boys in my mid-30s.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.360]   "My husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.700]   "from what we did not know at the time
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.160]   "was bacterial pneumonia,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.600]   "which quickly became septic shock.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.640]   "He also had an underlying heart condition.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.740]   "He died one week before his 34th birthday.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.460]   "He was normal one day and home with the Lord
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.980]   "in three days later.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.740]   "My question relates to the issue of blame
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.860]   "and God's timing in his death.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.820]   "We had thought his ailments were a flu bug or COVID
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360]   "and didn't realize the severity of what was truly going on.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.480]   "We had responded by following telephone guidance
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.380]   "from a Christian homeopathic provider
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.520]   "who had also assumed COVID,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.380]   "someone we trusted but perhaps should not have.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.880]   "As I grieve, I can't seem to stop blaming myself.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.580]   "I desperately want reassurance to know
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.100]   "that I did not hurt my husband,
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.240]   "let him down, or by our actions, shorten his lifespan.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.700]   "I tried to care for him and protect him as best as I could
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.100]   "based on the knowledge that I had at the time.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.380]   "We didn't know we were wrong.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.980]   "Once we were in the ER and discovered
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.460]   "he was facing septic shock,
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.300]   "I prayed fervently for the Lord to rescue and heal him.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.360]   "I guess I'm left wondering
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.040]   "if I should continue to feel responsible.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   "I need help to trust God if he was responsible,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.760]   "and if so, that he is still good despite taking my soulmate
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.220]   "and my best friend home at such a young
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.140]   "and difficult to understand time.
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.460]   "I would greatly appreciate any help you can offer me."
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.800]   - The reference to COVID makes me realize
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   how recent and raw this loss is.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.860]   This didn't happen five years ago.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.760]   - Right.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.120]   - So I want to be so careful.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.680]   I think the fact that she is reaching out to us
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.480]   in this fairly public way is a good sign
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   that she hasn't despaired of discovering new things
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.800]   in God's word that might ease the pain.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.040]   And I think she's right in that.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.720]   There are new things.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.340]   I'm sure she hasn't yet seen that God wants her to see
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.220]   for her own help and comfort and hope.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.980]   I think there will be new, fresh things, in fact,
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.540]   for her to see for the next 50 years.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.500]   She will see things in God's word 50 years from now
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.580]   that will shed light on this heart-wrenching loss
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.260]   in such a way, even at that distance,
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.340]   to make the love of Christ
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.580]   and the memory of her husband even more precious.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.500]   I am seeing things at age 76 that are shedding light
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.700]   on sorrows that I experienced 60 years ago.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   I still am getting new light on the meaning of those years.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.020]   So I expect that for her.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.700]   I think the way I would like to come at this
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.620]   is to raise the question, and it may sound surprising,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.280]   what would you do, how would you think,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   if you knew that it was your fault that your husband died?
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.860]   Now, I'm not suggesting that it was at all.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.300]   Clearly, it was not your fault.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.360]   But I'm asking you to make an experiment in your mind.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.420]   What if you had failed to put the emergency brake
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.940]   on the car and it had rolled over him
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.860]   and killed him while he was working on it?
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.800]   What if you were helping him clean one of his hunting guns
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.060]   and it accidentally went off and killed him?
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.260]   What if you fell asleep at the wheel and crashed
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.380]   and only he died in the wreck?
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.860]   What if you mixed up one of his medications?
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.740]   Or maybe instead just ask,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.480]   how would you counsel somebody in that situation?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.360]   Because there are thousands of people
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.220]   in that very situation.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.580]   They don't just wonder if they could have done more
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.860]   to save their loved one.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.940]   They know they caused the death accidentally.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.980]   Now, I suppose I could join the chorus
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.380]   of everyone around you and say what is obvious,
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.920]   namely, you did all you could.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.420]   Nobody is doubting your love
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.420]   and your care for your husband.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.420]   Everybody knows you are not responsible for his death.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.100]   And I do join that chorus.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.380]   But I don't think you wrote to us
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.820]   just for me to say the obvious
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.380]   that everybody else is saying, it's not your fault.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.760]   So what I want to say is,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.860]   if the Bible has an answer
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.660]   for how you would press on in life
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.440]   with freedom and hope and usefulness
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.020]   and even eventually joy,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.680]   even if you had caused his death,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.520]   then how much more can you be assured
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.780]   that God will help you press on in life
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.080]   with freedom and hope and usefulness
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   and eventually joy when you did not cause the death
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.860]   and were helpless to stop it?
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.380]   Most of the time,
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.660]   we turn to Genesis 50 verse 20
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.140]   to remind ourselves that all the bad things
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.300]   that happened to Joseph turned out for good
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.180]   by God's design, remember?
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.540]   He said, "As for you, you brothers, you rascal brothers
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.720]   "who caused all this trouble,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.740]   "as for you, you meant evil against me,
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.700]   "but God meant it for good."
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.540]   So we usually focus on Joseph
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.380]   and all the bad things that happened to him,
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.820]   but very rarely do we ponder
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.620]   what that verse means for Joseph's brothers
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.580]   who really were guilty of multiple sins
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.060]   that caused Joseph's misery.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.980]   And here's what Joseph says in the next verse
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.580]   to those brothers.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.180]   "So do not fear.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.960]   "I will provide for you and your little ones."
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.020]   Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.820]   Wow.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.700]   This does not mean they are not guilty.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.780]   They are guilty.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.620]   But it does mean that God has a future
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.240]   and a purpose for them, even though they were guilty.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.740]   They were the guilty ones
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.820]   and they caused all that misery
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.780]   for 17 years of Joseph's life.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.500]   And through one of them, amazingly, Judah,
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.380]   God would even bring a savior into the world.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:46.380]   Now, Paul handled his own guilt as a murderer the same way.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.100]   He saw that God had a merciful purpose in it
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.740]   for other guilty people.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.640]   He said in 1 Timothy 1:16,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.140]   "I received mercy for this reason,
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.100]   "that in me, as the foremost of sinners,
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.940]   "Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.420]   "as an example to those who were to believe in him
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.760]   "for eternal life."
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.820]   In other words, somehow, Paul was able to transpose
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:26.500]   the horrible sounding guilt of persecution and killing
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.820]   at his own hands into the beautiful music of mercy
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.140]   through him to other guilty sinners
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.260]   to whom God would show amazing patience.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.960]   Then change the focus just slightly
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.720]   from situations where someone really was guilty,
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.800]   but God made a future for them,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.300]   from that to the man born blind in John 9.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.220]   Now here, the apostles assume that someone must have sinned.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:08.460]   They just must have sinned for this calamity
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.020]   to come upon this blind man.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:16.180]   Like you, perhaps, from time to time, are tempted to think,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.980]   "Did we do something wrong?
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.960]   "Can there be a catastrophic loss like this
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.180]   "without someone having done something sinful?"
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.320]   So they asked Jesus, "Rabbi, who sinned,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.300]   "this man or his parents that he was born blind?"
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:42.000]   And Jesus answered, "It was not that this man sinned
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.480]   "or his parents, but that the works of God
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.240]   "might be displayed in him."
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.340]   Now that is an amazing answer,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.780]   and surely it applies to your situation.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.620]   Who sinned?
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.760]   Who was neglectful?
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.700]   Who put their trust in the wrong place?
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.360]   Who reacted too slowly?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.240]   Who failed to see the symptoms?
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.600]   Who's guilty here?
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.740]   Where's the sin?
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.120]   There's gotta be sin here.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.320]   To which Jesus answers, "It was not that you
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   "or your homeopathic advisor, or your doctors,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.720]   "or your husband sinned, or were neglectful,
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.300]   "or put your trust in the wrong place,
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   "or reacted too slowly, or failed to see the symptoms.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.180]   "Rather, it was that the works of God
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.100]   "might be displayed in him."
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.480]   To which you ask, "What works?"
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.240]   Well, for starters, your persevering faith
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.160]   in the reality, and power, and wisdom,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.400]   and goodness of God.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.180]   That is a miraculous work of God.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.360]   But it might be helpful for you to think on this.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.680]   When your husband died, God set in motion
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.160]   10,000 effects that you can't see.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.100]   Some of them will become manifest in a year or two,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.500]   and some of them in 50 years.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.840]   Your husband's death did not take God off guard,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.280]   nor was it meaningless, or absurd,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.460]   or without profound purpose.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.460]   A holy purpose, a sacred, precious purpose,
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.020]   precious in the sight of the Lord,
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.440]   is the death of his saints.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.740]   Psalm 113 and 116, "Your eyes, O God,
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.580]   "saw my husband's unformed substance
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.560]   "while he was being knit together in his mother's womb.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.840]   "In your book were written every one of them,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.320]   "the days that were formed for him,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.880]   "when as yet there was none of them.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.020]   "His days were written down with divine wisdom,
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.700]   "and the 10,000 ripple effects
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.660]   "that flow out from his life and his death
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.540]   "will not be in vain.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.360]   "Some of them you will know in this life,
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.180]   "most of them you won't."
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.700]   You are being tested.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.640]   But God has promised not to test you beyond your strength.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.280]   1 Corinthians 10, 13, "God is faithful.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.360]   "He will not let you be tested beyond your ability,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.880]   "but with the test, he will also provide the way of escape
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.560]   "that you may be able to endure it."
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.200]   Jesus promised his disciples
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.240]   that they would have trouble in the world,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.600]   and he also promised peace in the midst of it.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.000]   John 16, 33, "I have said these things to you
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.240]   "that in me you may have peace.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.360]   "In the world you will have trouble.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.800]   "Take heart, I have overcome the world."
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.160]   So that's what I want to leave you with,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.540]   the promise of peace, Christ's own peace.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.740]   John 14, 27, "Peace I leave with you.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.660]   "My peace I give to you.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.480]   "Not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.380]   "Let not your heart be troubled.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.880]   "Neither let it be afraid.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.340]   "There is a future and a hope.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.940]   "No suffering of God's loved ones is in vain."
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.260]   - Thank you for that hopeful word, Pastor John,
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.820]   and thank you for the raw email.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.540]   It takes courage to write it out, and we appreciate it,
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.780]   and we're humbled that you would send it to us.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.860]   Thank you for joining us today.

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.820]   Speaking of heavy topics,
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.200]   should we break a friendship over a gospel disagreement,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.780]   a disagreement about what constitutes gospel truth?
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.140]   Yes, Pastor John says, we should be willing to do that,
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.700]   and he will explain why and when
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.100]   that dramatic step is needed on Monday.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.060]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.740]   We'll see you back here on the other side of the weekend.
