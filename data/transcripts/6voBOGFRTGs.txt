[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   All right, Jesse, I think we have time for a couple more quick calls. Who do we have next?
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.160]   All right, next question. We have a question about writing non-technical stuff.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:21.520]   Hey, Cal, my name is Abhishek. I've been following your writing since the Google Reader days.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.880]   Thanks for all the advice over the years. My question is about getting better at writing.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.640]   I've read William Zinser's On Writing Well, and I've read the Elements of Style by Ed Strunk and
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.720]   White. This has really helped me write better technical documents in my work. I also read
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   widely. However, I want to write better blog posts and articles that are not as technical.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.600]   I want to emulate the writing styles of some of my favorite authors. What is the process I should
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.920]   follow in learning the way other authors write? How do I learn to reproduce the feeling I get
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   from reading their work? Do I dissect grammar and composition? Can you recommend a book or
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.920]   training that goes into this? The author I want to emulate in this case is Bill Bellevue. He
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.080]   primarily writes about nature, and his writing makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed. I'd
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.840]   love to be able to write like him. I remember you talking about doing this with your own writing
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.960]   career. How did you go about it? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.680]   Well, Abhishek, there's two things I'd recommend when it comes to improving nonfiction writing.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.400]   One, yes, dissect. Dissect the authors that you want to emulate and try to replicate their formula
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.160]   in your own writing. Now down the line, this will evolve into your own style, but that is deliberate
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   practice for style development. As you referenced, I did this back when I was first emerging as a
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.760]   nonfiction writer. I was trying to understand the then kind of new but quite popular nonfiction
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.880]   pop science style of idea writing. So I would dissect Malcolm Gladwell. I remember dissecting
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.840]   Clive Thompson, maybe some Stephen Johnson. But I would take articles, and I would break it down.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.160]   And I would figure out like, OK, here are the sections, and then what happens in each section?
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.840]   You know, opening story with a cliffhanger transition, idea introduction back to opening
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.080]   story. Like I'd really break these things down. And then I would try to emulate that in articles
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.360]   I was writing. So great. I am now going to take this style of this article. I broke down the
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   formula. I'm going to now try to write my own article that follows that formula. That's how
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.400]   you actually begin to grow those muscles, see what works, see what doesn't work. It's practice
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.520]   with direction. It's what makes practice deliberate and not just repetitious. You know, who used to do
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.200]   this famously was Ben Franklin. So when Ben Franklin was learning how to write, he would take
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.720]   essays or poetry and would break them down to their component parts and then try to replicate it from
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.680]   scratch. So he really had a mimic style way of learning because he had no other way of learning
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.160]   how to write. He was apprenticed to his brother's printing shop in Boston and wanted to become a
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.760]   writer. So he would just literally break down and reconstruct other people's writing. And then he
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.920]   started writing anonymous letters for his brother's newspaper in the name of characters. His brother
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   didn't know it was him, but he was at that point able to apply what he learned. And he was a pretty
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.520]   good mimic. And that's where he really developed his style. So I think it's a really effective
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.280]   tactic. So I would definitely recommend you do that. The second thing is, if at all possible,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.400]   you want to write for editing. There is a difference in the deliberate practice effect
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.680]   between writing something that someone's going to look at and potentially say, "Nope, that's not
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.040]   good. We're going to reject it or edit it heavily," versus writing for your own blog or writing your
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.240]   own journal. And this is what I did. So when I was deconstructing Gladwell, when I was deconstructing
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.000]   Thompson or Johnson, it wasn't for blog posts. I actually went out and found an online magazine
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   that had editing, but they needed content. So I was like, "I'm just good enough to get pieces in
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.520]   here." But they'll reject them if they're not good. And it was like a serious writers, but the
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.600]   magazine never really took off. It was called Flack Magazine. I think it eventually closed down.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.120]   But it had real editors and they were open to submissions. And there was a period of two years
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.280]   where that was where my writing energy was going. I believe this was primarily between my second
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.000]   book, How to Become a Straight-A Student, and my third book, How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.360]   It was between those two periods, which is why superstar actually reads like,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.960]   what if Malcolm Gladwell wrote a college admissions book? Because I was doing this
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.800]   training and I was focused on this magazine, not because they had a big audience, not because
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.600]   anyone ever saw those articles, but because I was deconstructing writers I admired,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.120]   then pitching an article to Flack. And then when they'd accept that pitch, I would write that
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.280]   article in a direct emulation of a style and article as deconstructing. Because I was writing
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.520]   for editing, it pushed me harder to make that better. The stakes were higher. And then I'd take
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.400]   another article and I was like, "Let me try this format." So I pitched an article that allowed me
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.440]   to practice that format. And then I would practice that format. And that's how I built up my initial
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.880]   nonfiction idea writing chops. It was through exactly that practice.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.200]   So that's my two piece of recommendation. Dissect writers, emulate their style,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.640]   if possible, do that emulation for editing so that you have that pressure and feedback to try
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.560]   to stretch yourself and make that writing as good as possible. And thank you, by the way,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.640]   for being such a longtime reader. The Google Reader Days, those are some of my favorite days,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:53.520]   2007, 2008. It was like the Study Hacks blog and you had your RSS reader. And I liked that day.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.760]   This was before social media had taken over the internet. And it was like interesting people with
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.360]   interesting blogs. And you would curate them in your RSS feed and see their articles that came in.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.880]   And I remember back then being big on the minimalist bloggers. This is when Leo Babuda
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   and Zen Habits. This was before the FIRE movement. But I'm trying to think. There's some other
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.080]   bloggers like that, people who were doing interesting radical experiments in their life.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.160]   And they'd write these essays about it. And it was also personal and interesting and creative.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.080]   And I just think there was like a high point, early Web 2.0 was this great high point of web
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.120]   production. And then five years later, all that got reduced to Facebook posts and Instagram things.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.600]   And we kind of lost that moment. So thanks for the memory, Abhishek. I miss and remember that time
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.920]   fondly.
