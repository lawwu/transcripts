[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.400]   more of the philosophical discussion,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.940]   not a lot of real practical nuts and bolts
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.780]   financial planning in this show,
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.140]   in fact, nothing of that.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740]   But if you're interested in philosophical discussions
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.380]   around money and government and things like that,
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.020]   especially as it relates to tax,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.920]   then you might enjoy today's show.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.420]   So with that caveat, I'll tell you the question.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.580]   The question comes in from a listener,
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.960]   writes in, says, "Hi Josh, I really enjoy your podcast.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.560]   "I've learned a lot and I really like your
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.400]   "more than average philosophical approach
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.600]   "to many of the topics.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400]   "However, I have a small rant.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800]   "These different feelings might be
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.300]   "just because I am from Europe and you are from the USA,
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.140]   "but I don't understand why so many Americans hate
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.300]   "or don't trust governments
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000]   "and try to minimize tax payments.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.140]   "Your last episode on cash advantage
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.580]   "touched on this as well.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.280]   "I understand that government wastes a lot of tax money,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.880]   "but it also does a lot of good.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.080]   "Infrastructure, financing research and science,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.820]   "healthcare, even social care, et cetera.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760]   "We take benefit of roads when we travel
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.920]   "and police when we need them,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.720]   "but we don't like paying taxes.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.760]   "Would you rather pay a toll tax for every road you use
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400]   "and pay a policewoman every time you need them?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.300]   "I know this is a never-ending discussion,
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.740]   "but just felt like saying this after your last episode
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580]   "and the examples that you gave of how to pay cash,
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.480]   "pay with cash for a mechanic to avoid taxes."
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.220]   I thought it was an interesting question
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.120]   and I've received many such questions like this
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.380]   'cause certainly I'm not shy in my opinions
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.860]   of encouraging people to minimize
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.760]   the amount of tax that they pay.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.100]   Hopefully I do a good job
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.400]   of always encouraging that legally.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.460]   I don't wish to encourage people to break the law
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.080]   and perhaps from time to time I stray too near to that.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   I don't know.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.800]   I'll talk in a moment about my comment
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.500]   about paying cash to the mechanic, et cetera,
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.980]   why that's important even though it's possible
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.620]   the mechanic might use a cash payment
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.200]   to not pay income tax on it.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.620]   I'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.460]   But I don't wanna be one
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.760]   who encourages people to break the law,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.140]   although I think there is a place and a time for that.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.320]   I have a lot of respect for people who are tax protesters,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.260]   but I'm not going to be associated with that,
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320]   or at least not in the conditions that I live in.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.060]   I don't see that as being a useful strategy
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.660]   at this point in time.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.500]   But I thought this listener
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.020]   raised a couple of interesting questions
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.500]   that would be worth discussing.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.020]   And I thought that it would be interesting
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.020]   to talk about them
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.900]   and then give a broader philosophical conversation.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.700]   And what I'll try to do is,
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.420]   towards the latter part of this show,
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.900]   after I deal with a few technical things here
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.940]   and just kind of a few quick answers,
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.940]   I'll try to lay out my vision,
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.800]   what I see as the ideal vision.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   And as part of my preamble here,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.820]   you should know, however, that this is, as I see it,
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.300]   largely theoretical at this point in time.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.700]   Very few people agree with my positions.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.540]   I have no influence or power,
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.220]   nor am I seeking any influence or power.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.800]   My only thought is to simply try to live my life
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.620]   in accordance with the principles and philosophies
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.340]   that I believe are the best,
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.440]   and try to live as an example for my neighbors.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.320]   And that's about it.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.740]   So don't think I'm not advocating
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.500]   for voting for somebody or really anything.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.100]   I'm out of the mainstream.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.380]   But if you're interested in how I've arrived
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.860]   at some thoughts after years of thinking
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.940]   about these things, I'll tell you where I'm at right now.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.220]   These shows are always very hard for me
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.440]   because the older I get,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.520]   the more humility I feel with regard to my ideas.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.140]   I think it's probably natural when we're young.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.460]   We think we know it all.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.880]   But it's a little hard to,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.420]   when you're on record with your ideas.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420]   It's easier when you're just talking with your buddies
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.220]   and you can grow and you can change.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.580]   But the older I get, the more I realize I don't know.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.980]   And yet, how do I ever find the time to sit down
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.940]   and spend the next 20 years searching out every answer?
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.920]   I can't do that.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.640]   So just take today's show in the tone
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.980]   of one friend speaking to another
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.420]   and just sharing with you what I think about.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.740]   So first, this listener says,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.660]   "It might just be because I am from Europe
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.080]   "and you are from the United States.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.180]   "But I don't understand why so many Americans hate
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.360]   "or don't trust governments
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.520]   "and try to minimize their tax payments."
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.440]   Now this one I think is an interesting question
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.620]   to begin with.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.740]   Because certainly, I am very vocal
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.380]   about minimizing tax payments
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.900]   to the United States government.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.740]   And there are many of us who are,
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.660]   and many of us Americans, who are very vocal about that.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.420]   And it's in many ways part of our culture.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.920]   The United States culture is a culture
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.780]   that was founded in rebellion, right?
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.440]   We overthrew King George.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.020]   Whether it was a good idea or not, frankly,
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.020]   if I could trade in and go back and live under King George,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.260]   I'd do it in an instant.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.660]   The early colonists paid less than 1% of their incomes
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.920]   in total net taxes.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.040]   Whereas today, Americans sit back
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.120]   and are happy with anywhere from a third
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.200]   to a half of their income going to taxes.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.960]   So all of the nostalgia about somehow things are better today
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.160]   under a constitution and all this stuff
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.600]   versus how they were under King George is nonsense.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.840]   So if I could, I'd go back to King George in an instant.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.680]   I'd give up.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.960]   You can have your, what was it?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.200]   No taxation without representation.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.600]   You can have your representation
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.520]   and I'll take the no taxation
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.900]   that the previous colonists enjoyed.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.960]   Much of the kind of American mythology,
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.880]   it really doesn't hold water when you dig into it.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.360]   But that being the case, or whether you agree or not,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.560]   regardless, the mythology has a controlling influence.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.960]   And Americans are deeply, generally,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.620]   distrustful of government.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.000]   Now that has waned significantly,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.200]   especially since the early 1900s.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.000]   That has changed substantially.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.680]   It's hard to overestimate and over-discuss
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.200]   the massive change that occurred
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.720]   from the United States of America pre-1900,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.360]   just for an easy round century number, to post-1900.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.040]   I mean, it's a completely different society.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.080]   But still, there are enough of the roots
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.800]   of the pre-1900 Americas in the American psyche
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.440]   and in the mythology and in the general psyche
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.920]   of the land that it makes us different.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.280]   Now, interestingly though,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.880]   if you try to compare Americans to Europe,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.680]   I don't think there's much of a comparison
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.640]   that you can make.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.120]   Because especially when it comes to taxes,
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.560]   almost all Americans believe that cheating on taxes,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.080]   not paying what you owe,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.440]   is morally and ethically unacceptable.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   And although I think most Americans
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.880]   say there's an exception to that, I would give exceptions.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.760]   It's not morally and ethically unacceptable
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.840]   in all circumstances, I would agree.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.360]   I believe you should pay the taxes that you owe.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.000]   And that's common across the United States of America.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.520]   In fact, the voluntary compliance rate
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.880]   in the United States is usually measured
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.840]   to be around 81 to 84%.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.560]   And that is one of the highest rates in the world.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.880]   One of the highest rates in the world.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.560]   By comparison, since we're using Europe
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.400]   and trying to compare Europe to the United States,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.040]   Germany has the highest compliance rate
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.360]   that's measured in Europe.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.280]   And Germany's voluntary tax compliance rate is 68%.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.740]   Whereas Italy's voluntary tax compliance rate is 62%.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.280]   So before you get too bent out of shape
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.920]   about what's wrong with Americans,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.480]   why do Americans complain and moan and grope and gripe
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.560]   and not trust their governments, et cetera,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.800]   and aren't we just European so much better?
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.720]   The data indicates otherwise.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   And my source, what I am alluding to here,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.240]   I'm pulling this data sourced from a Wikipedia article
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.440]   on the tax evasion in the United States.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.640]   You can look it up, just search Wikipedia
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.080]   for tax evasion in the United States.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.620]   And there is a discussion there
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.360]   where it directly cites that.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.020]   Interestingly, there was an Atlantic article
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.940]   published earlier this year in, I think, April of 2019,
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.040]   right around tax time,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.120]   called "Why Americans Don't Cheat on Their Taxes,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.480]   "The Weirdly Hopeful Story of How the United States
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.880]   "Came to be a Leader in Tax Compliance,"
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.540]   by the writer here, Renee Chun.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.740]   And one of the things that's interesting about this
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.200]   is they go through and the author of this article
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   points out why and how Americans are so much higher
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.600]   in terms of the American compliance with the tax rates.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.880]   And the author tries to go through
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.180]   and identify some of the different reasons
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.280]   why this might be the case.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   Why is there such a high percentage of the American people
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.980]   who say you should pay your taxes,
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.320]   and why is there such a high percentage
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.140]   of the American people who do pay their taxes?
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.820]   They talk about things like the income tax withholding,
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.100]   which the United States started,
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.760]   which if I could change one thing, two things,
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.920]   there was an article, I think Gary North wrote years ago,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.560]   on Lou Rockwell's site, where he said,
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.920]   "If I could have two things changed,
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.440]   "I would change only two things.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.480]   "I would eliminate federal withholding from paychecks
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.340]   "of people's taxes, and I would move the tax payment day
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.480]   "to the first Monday of November."
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.560]   The idea is that the first Tuesday of November
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.280]   is election day in the United States.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.960]   And so if every American had to file and actually pay,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.180]   write the check for their taxes
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.240]   on the first Monday of November,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.640]   and then go vote the next day,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.040]   that in and of itself would be
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.200]   a tremendously powerful thing to change.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.040]   And I agree.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.560]   I find that there's a very different perspective
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.760]   among business owners who have to make
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.960]   quarterly tax payments, and often one large tax payment
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.740]   when their taxes are due, as compared to employees
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.600]   who don't really see the amount,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.760]   they don't even know the amount of money
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.240]   that's withheld from their paychecks
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   due to employee withholding.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.400]   So in the article, "Americans Don't Cheat on Their Taxes
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.280]   "from the Atlantic," they talk about
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.680]   what accounts for this.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.240]   And basically, what's hinted at is probably
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.840]   it comes down to tax morale.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.800]   So I'll read just a paragraph here.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.040]   "Economists say a third factor,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.560]   "one with profound political implications, is tax morale.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.680]   "This is a catch-all term for various forces
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.700]   "that motivate people to pay taxes,
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.900]   "including social norms, democratic values, civic pride,
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.520]   "transparent government spending,
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.060]   "and trust in leadership and fellow citizens.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.720]   "People are more inclined to fudge,"
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.780]   yes, economists use that word, "their tax forms
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.300]   "if they think others aren't paying their fair share.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.540]   "None of this would seem to bode especially well
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.600]   "for tax morale in the United States,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.180]   "where faith in government has been dropping for decades.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.140]   "So why are Americans still paying?"
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.580]   And talks about some of the reasons why.
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.980]   You can judge for yourself if you think that will continue.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.340]   But don't be too quick to say,
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.100]   "Well, we just in Europe have much higher,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.080]   "we're just, everyone's okay with paying taxes,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.580]   "whereas in the United States, they're not."
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.860]   Maybe the difference between Europe and the United States
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.260]   is simply that there's a difference in tax rates.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.460]   The European tax rate is so much higher.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.160]   It's much more within your interest
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.540]   to avoid taxes and evade taxes
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.940]   if you're paying taxes at a 50% tax rate,
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.660]   versus if you're paying taxes at a 20% tax rate.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.220]   It's just a very different scenario.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.780]   So, but don't try to propose Europe quite so much
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.660]   until you actually look at the rate of compliance.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.140]   Again, Germany's is the highest at 68%.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.100]   The United States, however,
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.580]   is 81 to 84% voluntary compliance rate.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.340]   Now, the next question that you ask is this.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.340]   "I understand that government wastes a lot of money,
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.720]   "but it also does a lot of good,
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.140]   "infrastructure, financing research and science,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.940]   "healthcare, even social care.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.820]   "We take the benefit of roads when we travel
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.780]   "and police when we need them,
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.440]   "but we don't like paying taxes.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.380]   "Would you rather pay a toll tax for every road you use
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.340]   "and pay a police woman every time you need them?"
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.460]   Well, short answer is yes, absolutely.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.020]   I would rather pay a toll tax for every road I use
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.520]   and pay a police woman every time I need one,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.180]   than to pay the taxes and income taxes
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.100]   and everything else the way
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.500]   that it is generally assessed right now.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.540]   Now, there are a couple of red herrings
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.380]   that we need to get out of the way.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.620]   First, taxes are not really doing much
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.860]   to pay for roads and police women.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.820]   This is the biggest fallacy.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.880]   It is rather funny.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.820]   I don't know if you know it or not,
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.920]   but it's an ongoing meme and a joke
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.400]   among more libertarian leaning circles
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.420]   that you always wind up, "But my roads,
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.700]   "how are we gonna pay for the roads
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.380]   "if we don't have taxes?"
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.560]   I would bet you almost every anarchist,
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.700]   every libertarian I know,
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.660]   anybody who's in the more freedom-oriented, less taxation,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.020]   if you told us that the only function of government
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.460]   is gonna be the roads,
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.580]   and you said that the government's gonna take care of roads
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.420]   and nothing else, I think most of us
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.780]   would stop our griping.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.500]   Same thing, by the way, if tax rates were more modest,
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.260]   if tax rates were, say, under 10%.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.460]   I can't imagine that,
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.400]   I can't say I wouldn't gripe.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.140]   Hopefully, I'm griping less than I used to,
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.420]   but I'd probably still gripe,
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.660]   but it's just not really worth planning
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.280]   if it's under 10%.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.680]   It's when you get into the tax rates that we're at.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.540]   I mean, right off the top, 15% of your income is lost.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.420]   15 1/2% of your income is lost
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.100]   to Medicare Social Security taxes,
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.580]   plus, then, your federal income tax rates.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.140]   So it's very common, the normal situation
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.420]   is for all but the very low income,
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.620]   the normal situation is that you're automatically losing
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.220]   25% of your income,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.860]   and that can grind up to, in the United States,
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.300]   up to 50, 55 to 60%
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.820]   in very high-tax jurisdictions of your income is gone.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.460]   Well, that's just unacceptable.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.220]   And so it's very much within your best interest
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.980]   to do planning for that.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.020]   But the United States government
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.380]   does not spend money on roads and policewomen,
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.340]   or at least not much.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.140]   The vast majority of spending in the United States
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.180]   is based upon transfer payments,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.680]   trying to transfer money from one person to another.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.220]   The primary expenditures are Social Security
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.440]   and Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.340]   If you add up Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.240]   and then add in military spending,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.980]   you account for at least about,
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   I think it's 2/3 of the US federal budget.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.060]   It was with those things,
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.860]   2/3 of the US federal budget.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.460]   And my beef is not with roads and policewomen,
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.060]   but my beef is with Medicare, Medicaid,
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.280]   Social Security, and military spending.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.660]   Those are my beefs.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.140]   And unfortunately, in the United States,
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.320]   those are the things that are considered to be untouchable.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.540]   Those are the things that are considered to be sacrosanct.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.640]   So don't have this illusion
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.540]   that somehow the problem is roads.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.660]   Roads are not a problem.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.980]   But yes, to implement a system of privatized roads
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.400]   in today's world would be ridiculously simple to do.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.520]   One of the little jokes that libertarians
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.960]   usually like to point out when we're talking about my roads,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.000]   how are we gonna get the roads done?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.080]   Governments don't build roads.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.260]   They simply don't.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.300]   Governments do not build roads.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.160]   What governments do is sometimes engage
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.760]   in a planning process,
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.240]   trying to figure out where the roads go.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.960]   But usually they hire private contractors
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.280]   to do the studies to figure out
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.660]   where would be the best place for roads
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.480]   and road improvements.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.100]   Then they facilitate an extremely corrupt
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.500]   and bloated and inefficient process of securing bids,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.420]   which leads to massive corruption of small favors
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.500]   and donations to campaign donations
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   by all the large road contractors to the local politicians
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.380]   to try to help them in the re-election campaign.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.780]   And then you wind up with a contract that's awarded
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.500]   to a private company to build the road.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.760]   And the private company is the one
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.960]   who actually builds the roads.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.780]   Governments don't build roads.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.220]   So if it's that difficult,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.500]   or that's the thing,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.360]   it's hard to imagine a government program
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.540]   that could be privatized easier than building the roads.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.220]   Now, there are some things where you would say,
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.100]   how do we figure out the easements
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.620]   and how do we figure out the eminent domain
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   and all that stuff?
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.280]   It's a little bit thorny,
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.540]   but I don't know anybody that's all that concerned
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.380]   about the roads.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.380]   I'm not turned off about the roads.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.500]   But you don't need to pay 60% of your income
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.140]   to finance roads.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.740]   The other thing about police spending,
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.260]   frankly, these examples you use
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260]   are some of the easiest things to privatize.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.580]   Just use police women as an example.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.900]   Would I rather hire a policewoman when I need one?
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.700]   Well, absolutely I would.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.780]   And there's an easy, obvious parallel
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.140]   that could easily be built in the United States.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.580]   Now, in the United States,
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.500]   would be different from Europe,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.820]   but in the United States,
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.260]   if you call the police and they come out to your home,
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.180]   you don't pay a fee, a usage fee for that service.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.960]   You also generally don't get much great service.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.060]   Half the time they shoot you,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.280]   half the time they don't show up when you need them,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.700]   half the time they don't investigate the crimes.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.300]   Where I'm from in South Florida,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.260]   I have several friends who are police officers,
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.080]   and at this point,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.580]   they don't even bother investigating minor crimes,
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.820]   minor property crimes, et cetera.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.860]   They pile a police report
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.520]   so you can do it for insurance purposes.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.780]   But if your stuff gets ripped off of your house,
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.100]   you're not gonna have any,
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.420]   I mean, they'll dust for fingerprints,
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.300]   but they're not gonna do anything
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.560]   to try to catch the people.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.540]   I had a truck get stolen.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.940]   Truck got stolen.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.900]   The guys came out and made an effort.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.140]   I shouldn't be that cruel.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.660]   Made an effort to dust a few places for prints
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.160]   on my pickup truck after I recovered it,
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.060]   but they didn't do anything to try to catch the thieves.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.780]   There was no massive law enforcement effort to say,
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.080]   oh, we're gonna go and get these people
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.300]   who stole the truck and we're gonna get off.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.680]   It's just, so you don't get great service.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.340]   Now, if there's a murder or something like that,
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.480]   people, they treat that a little bit more seriously.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.020]   But again, where I'm from in many places,
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.380]   it's not even worth calling them for the except
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.340]   of get a police report for your insurance.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.720]   But you don't generally pay for the hourly work
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.900]   of having a police officer come out.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.180]   Same thing with fire.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.580]   But what you do pay for is if you call out
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.700]   an ambulance service.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.580]   And the way that things are often done
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.700]   is that the fire service and the ambulance service
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.140]   has kind of have been integrated.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.540]   But you get billed if you call out for a medical call.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.700]   And so if you call an ambulance,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.700]   you get a bill for your ambulance ride to the hospital.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.460]   And then you have private insurance
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.140]   that usually will pay that bill,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.660]   if not, you wind up owing the bill.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.140]   And then sometimes the bill is negotiated, whatever.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.300]   But it's not just automatically covered by the government.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.500]   Well, it would be very simple
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.900]   to apply that exact same thing to firefighters.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.220]   And it'd be very simple to apply
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.260]   that exact same thing to police work.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.140]   That could be easily privatized.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.260]   You could be easily, even if the work
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.580]   were actually coordinated by a local government,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.380]   you could easily charge usage fees,
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.500]   call out fees for calling the police out, et cetera.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.420]   And that could easily be covered
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.620]   with private insurance policies.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.860]   That's not unknown.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.020]   There are many of us in the United States
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.540]   who out of concern if we ever kill somebody in self-defense,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.500]   maintain private insurance policies
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.940]   to cover court costs and fees and lawyers fees
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.100]   and things like that, or defending yourself.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.100]   That's fairly popular, at least advertised popular
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.420]   in the United States.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.820]   And so there are all kinds of ways
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.540]   that those things could be covered.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.060]   So don't fall into the idea that somehow
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.740]   everyone is out there griping about police officers
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.060]   and everyone is griping about building roads.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   That's not the gripe.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.340]   The gripe is the other stuff.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.660]   The gripe is the massive transfer programs
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.340]   and the entitlement programs.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.620]   Now, let's talk about those a little bit.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.200]   I don't think that these programs are fundamentally good.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.340]   They're fundamentally useful.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.260]   I have a number of complaints,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.780]   but let me just speak practically.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.700]   It doesn't really matter what I think
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.500]   or what you think about them.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.420]   There is a massive political movement
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.140]   of people who believe that these things are good.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.580]   There's no chance whatsoever
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.020]   that the United States of America
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.060]   is going to disband Medicaid or Medicare or Social Security,
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.300]   at least not politically.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.180]   There is no political will for that whatsoever.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.420]   Every person who even tries,
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.140]   the last president in the United States
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.940]   who tried to touch one of these entitlement programs
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.120]   was President George W. Bush.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.180]   And it was interesting, I read about it in his memoirs,
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.260]   in "Decision Points," I think it was called,
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.460]   where he was just talking about how one of his big regrets
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.220]   of his presidency was how he couldn't make any progress
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.820]   even on a partial privatization of Social Security.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.140]   And yet it cost him massively politically.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.380]   President Obama certainly didn't try to say,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.260]   "Let's minimize entitlement programs,"
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.420]   the opposite direction.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.420]   And President Trump was politically savvy enough
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.780]   to from the beginning never even bother
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.980]   to try to say anything about,
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.100]   "Let's minimize entitlement programs."
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.140]   Once you get a group of people that recognizes
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.620]   that they can vote themselves money
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.060]   from the government treasury, you're pretty much lost.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.800]   And so my opinion or your opinion about this
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.860]   makes no difference whatsoever.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.240]   What I think personally will happen, my personal opinion,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.920]   is that in the coming decades,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.960]   all of these programs will prove to be worthless
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.220]   because there's simply not gonna be any money.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.660]   But that's not gonna be anything fast,
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.460]   it's gonna be something excruciatingly slow and painful.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.380]   And all the people that thought,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.260]   "Well, if I just vote myself some more money,
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.420]   "it'll all work out," are going to be sorely disappointed.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.140]   Last week on Twitter, I shared an interesting
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.740]   Washington Post article,
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.580]   the headline of which was called,
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.260]   "Maine Families Face an Elder Boom
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.820]   "and Worker Shortage in Preview of Nation's Future."
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.940]   I thought it was a well-written article.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.260]   Jeff Stein was the reporter, and he was talking in Maine
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.700]   and dealing with different people
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.080]   who were really facing just awful problems.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.260]   Even though they're fully qualified for Medicaid,
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.780]   they can't get help.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.420]   Couple of excerpts for you.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.780]   Flaherty's mother, Caroline, has for two years
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.780]   qualified for in-home care,
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.060]   paid for by the state's Medicaid program.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.380]   But the agency could not find someone to hire
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.200]   amid a severe shortage of workers
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.300]   that has crippled facilities for seniors across the state.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.620]   With private help now bid up to $50 an hour,
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.660]   Janet and her two sisters have been forced to do
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.740]   what millions of families
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.100]   in a rapidly aging America have done,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.900]   take up second, unpaid jobs,
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.820]   caring full-time for their mother.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.960]   "We do not know what to do.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.040]   "We do not know where to go.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.500]   "We're in such dire need of help,"
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.980]   said Flaherty, an insurance saleswoman.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.980]   Across Maine, families like the Flaherty's
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.600]   are being hammered by two slow-moving demographic forces,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.540]   the growth of the retirement population
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.240]   and a simultaneous decline in young workers
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.220]   that have been exacerbated by a national worker shortage
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.940]   pushing up the cost of labor.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.500]   The unemployment rate in Maine is 3.2%,
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.860]   below the national average of 3.7%.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.940]   Later, "We've added an entire generation
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.980]   "since we first put the safety net in place
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.380]   "with no plan whatsoever for how to support them,
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.620]   "said Ai-jen Poo,

[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.340]   As the oldest state, Maine is the tip of the spear,
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.580]   but it foreshadows what is to come for the entire country.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.640]   Last year, Maine crossed a crucial aging milestone.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.340]   A fifth of its population is older than 65,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.660]   which meets the definition of super-aged,
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.220]   according to the World Bank.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.700]   By 2026, Maine will be joined by more than 15 other states,
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.800]   according to Fitch Ratings,
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.820]   including Vermont and New Hampshire,
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.460]   Maine's neighbors in the Northeast,
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.260]   Montana, Delaware, West Virginia, Wisconsin,
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.460]   and Pennsylvania.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.940]   More than a dozen more will meet that criterion by 2030.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.340]   Separately in the article, we read this.

[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.400]   Separately, Congress created a commission
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.020]   to study the long-term care problem.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.600]   In 2013, it issued dozens of recommendations,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.040]   including a national strategy to help family caregivers.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.780]   But a fair number of these things
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.460]   have not been implemented.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.600]   "Those that have been implemented
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.420]   "are being implemented far too slowly,"
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.060]   said Bruce Chernoff, co-author of the commission's report
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.320]   and president and chief executive of the SCAN Foundation,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.600]   which advocates on long-term care issues.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.880]   "Left unaddressed, this will be catastrophic.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.580]   "We as a country have not wrapped our heads
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.860]   "around what it's going to take to pay for long-term care,"
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.060]   Chernoff said.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.280]   "Other countries have responded to their aging populations
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.680]   "with government-provided care,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.460]   "and many have beefed up the number of aids and providers.

[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.100]   "that do not provide a universal long-term care benefit,"
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.740]   said Howard Gleckman, author of a book about long-term care
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.580]   and a senior fellow
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.220]   at the Urban Institute of Nonpartisan Think Tank.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.100]   Now, you can read the article if you want.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.980]   It's on the Washington Post from August 15, 2019.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.380]   But this, in my opinion, is a perfect preview
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.140]   of what you can expect to see repeated
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.680]   thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.160]   over the next few decades.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.380]   No matter how much it might feel good to say,
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.320]   "Well, we've got Medicaid,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.700]   "we're gonna cover all the people,"
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.060]   the money's not there.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.680]   And for these people who retired, what happened is
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.820]   the culture in the United States voted themselves
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.860]   all kinds of massive government programs,
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.420]   which were predicated upon having
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.380]   a whole bunch of young people building and working
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.660]   to pay taxes to pay for the old people.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.340]   Then, the old people didn't bother to have any children,
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.060]   so the birth rate declined massively,
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.440]   and now there aren't many workers
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.140]   who are paying for the old people.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.780]   So, what's the solution?
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.700]   There is no solution in terms of a government solution.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.460]   You can't just magically print babies.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.900]   Birth rates continue to decline
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.340]   in the United States of America.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.980]   And you can't increase the taxes more
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.820]   'cause people are gonna find
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.740]   they're gonna be willing to move more
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.460]   and decrease those taxes.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.580]   And if taxes get much higher,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.400]   people just simply say it's not worth it.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.060]   You're gonna have an increasing press
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.380]   towards increasing immigration
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.580]   because that's gonna be one of the only ways
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.940]   that American politicians see
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.380]   that they can increase the tax rolls
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.100]   or to bring in more immigrants to stabilize the population.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.620]   But ultimately, what's gonna happen
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.820]   is the people who are dependent on the government programs
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.680]   are going to be screwed.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.420]   They're going to run out.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.700]   They're not gonna be there.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.020]   Doesn't matter how great your Medicaid benefits are,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.460]   the state can't send you workers
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.300]   'cause they're not gonna pay
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.060]   what the $50 an hour people are charging
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.400]   in the private market.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.320]   When the government gets involved in these markets,
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.720]   it winds up screwing up
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.660]   because it's easier for politicians to promise benefits
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.540]   than to actually pay for stuff.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.180]   That's what we've been talking about on this show
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.380]   for months and months and months.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.620]   It's easy to make promises.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.460]   It's hard to actually pay for stuff.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.220]   So we've got needs and opportunities.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.100]   This has to be solved at the community level.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.640]   You first, you work on your own children,
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.780]   making sure that your own children
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.620]   are willing to take care of you when you're old.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.820]   You have a responsibility to take care of your parents
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.660]   when they're old.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.740]   And then you build a community fabric
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.160]   where individuals caring for their neighbors.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.100]   That's the only solution that there is to it.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.640]   So I say this to say it's a preview
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.040]   of what we're gonna expect over the coming decades.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.920]   So you can't think that, oh, we have better things
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.660]   and everything's gonna be fixed
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.300]   if we just have more programs.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   The money's not there.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.860]   It's not going to be there.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.620]   And systematically, in my opinion,
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.800]   this is probably gonna lead to a massive diminishment
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.660]   of the power of the nation state some decades from now,
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.100]   30, 50, I don't know, 75 years from now, who knows?
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.100]   Maybe I'll be around to see it, maybe I won't.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.940]   But there are major problems and major moral hazards
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.320]   of these programs, and these programs are the problem,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.000]   not having roads.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.220]   That's not the problem.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.260]   The problem is the entitlement programs,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.980]   the wealth transfer programs.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.140]   And what I see happening,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.300]   and what I think will continue to happen,
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.580]   at least in the United States,
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.280]   is these welfare programs are going to continue
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.300]   to fuel anger of one group of people
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.540]   against another group of people,
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.580]   and anger at the government,
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.100]   which means probably in time,
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.620]   the voluntary tax compliance rate
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.460]   is gonna continue to go down.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.060]   I'm convinced that this is one of the things
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.020]   that are the foremost vanguard of all of the issues
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.580]   with the immigration debate in the United States right now.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.900]   Probably the biggest issue, if not the biggest,
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.940]   one of the biggest issues right now in the United States
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.620]   is a major immigration debate.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.020]   And this is usually played out in the political circles
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.020]   as somehow some kind of racist versus non-racist position.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.940]   I don't think it's that way.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.020]   I've met and talked to lots of people
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.260]   on all sides of the political issues.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.340]   I have never, let me think,
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.340]   I have never encountered somebody who is,
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.680]   I have never personally spoken to somebody
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.140]   who is just racist, who's outright racist,
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.780]   especially somebody who's in the anti-immigration camp,
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.520]   or the President Trump build a wall camp.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.060]   I've never spoken to anybody who is in that situation
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.220]   who is racist, who just doesn't like brown people
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.900]   or black people or whatever the issue is.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.940]   Never happened.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.260]   But what I have seen constantly
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.780]   is concerns about the transfer payments,
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.220]   about trying to transfer money from one person to another.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.020]   And there are millions and millions of people
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.140]   all across the United States who look down
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.940]   and recognize how much of their income
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.500]   is stolen from them in income taxes,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.240]   and how much is being transferred
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.460]   in the form of welfare payments
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.940]   to people who are immigrants to the country
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.380]   and who may or may not be paying taxes.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.940]   Now, there is an important thing to discuss
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.220]   and actually look at and say,
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.740]   what's actually happening with the data?
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.820]   What's actually happening?
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.700]   Are immigrants actually using welfare programs?
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.220]   Is there actually a net loss?
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.420]   But on the whole, if you look at the data,
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.840]   the only people who in the United States
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.140]   are net taxpayers over the course of their lifetime
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.820]   are white men speaking as a group.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.540]   And so when you look at that and say,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.320]   white women are negative net taxpayers,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.820]   black men, black women, brown men, brown women
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.740]   are all negative taxpayers when taken as racial classes,
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.500]   you can understand why there's a bit of frustration
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.460]   on the part of many white men.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.100]   And so I think you see a major,
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.100]   it's almost like the taxes are a bellows
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.020]   on a blacksmith's forge making the frustration
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.700]   and the heat drive up.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.380]   It's not a matter of racism or non-racism,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.300]   it's a matter of why is my money being taken
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.660]   and transferred to those people over there?
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.900]   And there is this issue very possibly
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.220]   could rip the United States apart.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.200]   And it comes down to these things
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.140]   like the government programs and taxes.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.260]   Now, I think personally, just indulge me for a moment,
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.900]   I think I could solve the immigration problem.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.580]   And here's how I would do it if I were emperor of the world.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.740]   Number one, I would eliminate the welfare state
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.300]   and eliminate all transfer tax payments.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.140]   Every single transfer tax payment,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.100]   every single aspect of the welfare state, gone.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.020]   I'm not saying you could eliminate all tax.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.020]   I personally, I'm not an anarchist.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.720]   I believe there should be tax,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.260]   I believe there should be government,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.200]   I believe it's important,
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.100]   but it should be a certain type of government.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.660]   So I don't personally, I'm not an anarchist.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.980]   But if you eliminate all transfer payments,
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:03.160]   what happens is you take away a major source of frustration
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.300]   for individual people.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.700]   Because now, if they are paying tax,
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.160]   they understand that they're paying tax
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.980]   for something that's for everybody.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.700]   If they understand they're paying tax for a road,
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.300]   they're paying a tax for a road.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.740]   They're not paying tax so that money
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.940]   can come out of their pocket
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.860]   and be transferred to that person over there
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.100]   that they see who's not working,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.260]   that's not being productive.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.100]   They know they're just simply paying for a road.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.140]   So number one, eliminate the welfare state,
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.260]   eliminate all transfer tax payments.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.540]   Then you could solve the immigration problem
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.320]   with number two, establish firm border controls
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.860]   to process all people in order to screen out criminals.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.620]   I don't think that, in my opinion,
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.860]   I don't think that government should have the right
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.180]   or should engage in the practice
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.900]   of trying to hinder the movement of non-criminal persons.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.180]   But criminal persons do need to be apprehended
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.860]   and made to pay for their crime.
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.620]   Number three, establish free, unhindered,
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.420]   no cost access to the United States or any country
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.160]   for any immigrating person.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.900]   And then you have the best of both worlds.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.460]   You have free access for people to flow
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.640]   into free markets, to go and pursue work,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.240]   to go and pursue community,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.320]   to establish themselves wherever they want to be.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.800]   That solves a major problem of the inefficiencies
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.000]   of government bureaucrats trying to say,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.960]   well, we need 22,000 of this kind of worker.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.320]   We need 15,000 of this kind of worker.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.880]   We need to issue 182,000 of this kind of visa.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.520]   It's insane to think that somehow
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.120]   some government bureaucrat somewhere
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.880]   can engage in effective central planning of immigration
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.780]   to figure out what kind of worker we need here
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.060]   and what kind of worker we need is there.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.540]   Let the market work it out.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.440]   But stop the transfer payments from one person to another.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.940]   I think also you could solve a lot of the frustrations
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.360]   by making sure that there were changes
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.220]   to citizenship and voting.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.780]   I think if you establish careful identification laws
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.540]   for voting to ensure that only citizens
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.260]   are engaging in voting, that would make a big difference.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.140]   If you lengthen the pathway to citizenship
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.240]   while simultaneously removing visa restrictions
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.220]   on workers, et cetera, I think that would solve
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.460]   a lot of the problems of how do you bring people together
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.820]   and be open to immigration
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.340]   while simultaneously bringing a society together.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.900]   And then finally, you have to affirm
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.020]   individual people's absolute right
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.380]   to control their own property
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.420]   without other people trying to interfere.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.060]   The right of that person to discriminate
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.580]   or not discriminate with their property,
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.100]   the right of that person to manage their property
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.980]   the way they could, and that way every person feels free
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.860]   and they can handle their own property,
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.060]   they can handle their own situation
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.920]   without interference by bureaucrats.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.120]   There's Joshua's five-part plan
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.040]   to solve the stickiest issue in the United States
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.180]   at this point in time.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.540]   But at its foundation, the frustration,
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.180]   a lot of it stems from these tax systems.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.500]   Now, I didn't really mean to start talking
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.500]   about immigration, but there are rippling consequences
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.560]   to these programs that can't be seen in advance.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.940]   And yet these are the things that make a big, big difference.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.880]   Additionally, as the size of government grows,
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.600]   and as you wind up with government handling
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   more and more of these things,
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   you wind up with much higher levels of corruption.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.240]   And there's a huge moral hazard
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.040]   of having large government systems here
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.000]   where you don't have that
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.720]   if you have a small and restrained government.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.920]   As the size and involvement of government grows
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.880]   in an economy and in society,
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.120]   corruption and inequity among persons will always grow.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.560]   Now, let me just give you a very simple example.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.300]   Let's assume that you have a government
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.360]   that's extremely small,
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.480]   and all it does is take care of roads and policewomen.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.180]   It has to take care of courts too.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.220]   I'll get to that in just a moment.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.580]   I think the number one basic function of government
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.580]   should be to handle the judiciary.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.140]   But let's assume that it just does roads,
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.420]   policewomen, and courts, and there's nothing else.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.780]   Now, let's say that you are a wealthy person
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.620]   and you have a tiny tax rate, a few percent of,
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.860]   if you were still taxing income,
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.820]   let's just say it's a 5% or 10% of income,
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.020]   flat tax across the board.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:55.500]   Every citizen, every resident owes 10% of their income
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.240]   to the US government.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.660]   Is there a lot of incentive for local business people
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.140]   and wealthy people, et cetera,
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.660]   to start buying their way in and out of Congress?
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.180]   Is there a lot of incentive for big companies,
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.460]   big pharmaceutical companies, big oil companies,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.560]   big insurance companies to spend millions of dollars
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.140]   on their political action committees
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.080]   to buy their legislation done through Congress?
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.740]   Is there a big incentive for the local realtor board
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.260]   to have their political action committee
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.020]   and raise $150,000 to send to the representative in Congress
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.100]   to make sure that they maintain the housing exclusion,
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.540]   section 121 housing exclusion?
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.860]   There's no incentive to it
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.940]   because you have a small government
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.540]   and the government's not involved.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.340]   And so you would immediately have
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.220]   many billions of dollars less of interference and influence
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.020]   by these companies trying to interfere
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.540]   in government circles.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.120]   But now when you come to a situation
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.180]   where a wealthy person is faced with a 50% tax rate,
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.620]   there is massive incentive for that person
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.120]   to spend several millions of dollars
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.860]   to have the tax code adjusted
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.100]   in a way that helps their situation
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.140]   versus paying the money in tax.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.300]   If you've got a $10 million tax bill,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.100]   you can afford to spend a couple million dollars
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.520]   on your local politicians
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.420]   to make things go your way a little bit.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.140]   And the individuals are just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.060]   One of the biggest problems in the United States
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.060]   is that every single big company
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.460]   to basically survive in the modern world
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.260]   when you have a huge, all powerful, all knowing,
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.600]   all involved executive state.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.180]   Basically every single company
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.700]   has to commit millions and millions of dollars
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.140]   towards their political action committee,
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.260]   towards their lobbyists in Washington, DC.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.420]   And this leads to incredible corruption.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.660]   I used to sit in this stuff,
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.740]   I would go to every year,
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.580]   I'd go to an annual meeting
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.380]   for the insurance company I used to work for.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.000]   And I would always go to the legislative lunch update
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.580]   where our company's lobbyists would come
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.780]   and give us a report.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.300]   And several times I went
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.860]   and did the political action days up in Tallahassee, Florida
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.020]   with my local insurance boards.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.260]   We would say, "Here are our issues."
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.580]   And I would go up to Tallahassee
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.420]   and go around and meet with all the state senators
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.060]   and the state congresspeople and say,
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.980]   "Here's our thing, here's our issue."
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.900]   When you have the government involved in these things
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.620]   where there's no reason for it,
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.500]   you have nothing but massive political spending on it.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.740]   And so as the state grows,
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.300]   you're always gonna get more corruption.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.020]   And so one of the things I see
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.240]   is that if you minimize your tax payments to the state,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.460]   you wind up with less corruption.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.620]   You wind up with more efficiency
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.960]   'cause they have less money to spend,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.860]   which is incredibly important,
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.820]   but you also wind up with less corruption.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.660]   The United States of America
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.300]   is one of the most corrupt countries on earth.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.020]   And what has happened to happen is,
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:29.980]   it's not the old way,
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.540]   it's not the way that it is in,
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:37.020]   insert little banana republic country here
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.620]   or little African dictatorship here.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.380]   It's not as simple and easy as here's a couple
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.420]   of hundred dollar bills
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.260]   or here's a briefcase full of cash.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.880]   That kind of corruption is petty
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.160]   and it's simple to deal with
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.360]   'cause everybody can get through it.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.560]   The corruption in the United States is big money
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.000]   and it has to be done massively.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.680]   Look at how much money is spent on a presidential election.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.760]   Look at how much money is spent
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.280]   on every single senator and congressman's election.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.360]   It's insane.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.640]   And yet this is a result
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.480]   of having a giant executive state involved in everything.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.620]   Now, I'm opposed to tax evasion.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.760]   I don't think that should be done.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.840]   I don't think it's a good strategy
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.300]   and especially, it's just not a good strategy in my opinion.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.580]   I'm sensitive to the times
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.180]   where it has been a good strategy.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.400]   I'm sensitive and sympathetic
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.220]   with many of the arguments of the tax protesters.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.080]   But at this point in time,
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.280]   I don't think it's generally a wise strategy.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.920]   Now, I have, thankfully,
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.480]   I have become a little bit more moderate in my own opinions
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.520]   and my frustrations over the years.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.400]   Over the years, I used to be very frustrated about it.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.800]   These days, I've lost a lot of that.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.040]   I just simply view taxation as basically payments to the mob.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.840]   I basically think of the US government
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.320]   like a mafia mob that controls a certain neighborhood.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.080]   And that neighborhood has certain attributes.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.940]   Some of them are nice, some of them are not nice.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.340]   If I wanna live in that neighborhood
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.960]   and get the benefits of living in that neighborhood,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.680]   I have to pay the mob.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.000]   And it's just practically,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.160]   it's far too dangerous for me to not pay them
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.120]   and have my legs broken.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.680]   It's far too dangerous for me not to pay them
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.840]   every cent they owe, they want,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.800]   and have, get locked in prison or something like that.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.840]   It's just too dangerous.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.840]   So either I pay the mob their extortion fee
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.560]   or I leave and go somewhere else.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.400]   And it's no different than dealing
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.200]   with any government official anywhere else in the world.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.400]   It's just a practical assessment of how much money I make
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.000]   after the cost of the extortion fees
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.480]   and if it's still worth my time.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.960]   Think about it with a tariff example,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.280]   because it's a more direct tax,
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.040]   which by the way, I think tariffs, nevermind.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.600]   Let's say I have a product that I wanna sell
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.440]   and I wanna go and sell my product
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.060]   in the national borders of Loompa land.
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.080]   Well, if the government of Loompa land
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.560]   imposes a tariff on me,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.680]   then I have to simply sit down and do a calculation.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.760]   Is it worth it?
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.200]   How much can I sell of my product in Loompa land?
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.720]   I think the Loompa leaders are dumb for imposing tariffs.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.360]   It only hurts their citizenry, makes them pay more money.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.720]   It's not my business to fight about it.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.160]   I just calculate the cost and say,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.800]   do I wanna participate or not?
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.640]   So, and as an advocate for freedom,
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.560]   practically speaking,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.160]   the first goal of living a free lifestyle
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.260]   is staying out of prison.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.460]   So I pay taxes and I recommend you do too.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.360]   And thankfully, when you live in a tax system
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.040]   where the taxes are as high as the US
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.440]   or many places in Europe,
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.680]   then you have a system
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.980]   where because of the high levels of corruption,
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.040]   then there are wrinkles in the law.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.740]   And so if you simply read the wrinkles in the law
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.760]   and align your activities with them,
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:39.080]   then you can follow all of those adjustments
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   and put yourself in a situation
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.640]   where you can follow the law perfectly
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.240]   and yet result in a very low tax rate.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.360]   And that's the double-edged sword of a large state.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.880]   When you have it, you always have wrinkles
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.800]   and anybody can get around it.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.200]   The Realtor Board, the US Association of Realtors
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.960]   has been incredibly effective in lobbying
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.440]   and continually lobbying for the deductibility
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.600]   of mortgage interest against your taxes
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.700]   and in the exclusion for capital gains
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.700]   on the sale of a personal residence.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.840]   Thank the local association of Realtors in your community
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.280]   for keeping it that way.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.620]   Well, I don't think it should be there.
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.280]   I don't think the local association of Realtors
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.120]   should have it.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.940]   I don't think they should have a PAC.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.780]   I don't think they should do lobbying.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.400]   I think that I wish it weren't that way,
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.500]   but it is that way.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.720]   So I can still come in
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.680]   and I can buy an individual house that I live in.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.000]   I can live in it cheaply.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.280]   I can mortgage it to the hilt.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.840]   I can deduct the interest against my other taxes.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.080]   And then I can sell that house two or more years later
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.900]   and I can pay no tax on the gain from that residence.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.000]   It's truly tax-free income.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.460]   I followed every single law.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.660]   I just use the fact that the local board of Realtors
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.380]   has this political clout, has this political power
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.560]   and the US government has chosen to set up the tax code
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.400]   in this way.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.220]   You can do it too.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.620]   And so that's what I spend the vast majority of my time
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.040]   talking about on this show.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.900]   That's what I spend all my time discussing
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.540]   is teaching you how to do that,
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.680]   following the law carefully.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.540]   Now, I briefly touched on
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.520]   and what this listener was talking about.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.700]   I just simply said that one of the benefits of paying cash
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.860]   is often you can get a discount.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.700]   If you're gonna pay with cash,
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.140]   always ask for a cash discount.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.620]   And that cash discount can be offered by the person
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.300]   for many reasons.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.860]   Not the only one of which might be that the person
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.820]   who I'm doing business with may or may not be paying taxes
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.740]   on the money, the cash that comes in.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.780]   There are many reasons why you get a cash discount on cash.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.500]   For example, just the security of cash.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.780]   It's possible that if you write a check,
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.000]   the check may not clear.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.920]   It's possible that if you swipe a credit card,
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.320]   the company may issue, you may get a charge back.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.480]   Those of us who run merchant accounts,
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.640]   you have all kinds of problems with charge back sometimes
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.440]   and figuring out how to get people to pay.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.240]   Just having the security of knowing there's cash in hand
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.360]   has a significant value to a merchant.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.320]   It's cash, it's here, it's now,
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.960]   and it can't be taken away from me.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.400]   That's a big, big deal.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.760]   Another example would just simply be the low cost.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.260]   Credit card transactions eat up a couple to 3%
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.980]   of your fees, depending on the kind of credit card.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.220]   And so most merchants still offer the ability
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.900]   to process credit cards because it allows them
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.340]   to get more business and higher sales, et cetera,
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.540]   which is worth the 3% fees, but it's still a cost to them.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.620]   They're still paying those fees every single transaction.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.300]   Where do you think your credit card rewards points
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.140]   come back?
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.260]   Where do you think your credit card cash back schemes
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.940]   come back from?
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.860]   That's where it is.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.760]   So you can get a discount for simply that.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.960]   That's probably worth a 10% discount.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.300]   So there are lots of reasons there.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.480]   And then of course, I did point out that whether
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.080]   or not the person reports the money, that's up to them.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.640]   Now, I don't personally, it doesn't personally bother
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.880]   my conscience to do that.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   It's none of my business how another person interacts
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.580]   with the government.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.920]   And I like the privacy of making sure
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.280]   that I can simply pay, that I don't have to have
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.520]   all of my personal data exposed
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.840]   by having their credit card.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.580]   You go to the mechanic and you give him your credit card
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.080]   and all of a sudden you get all kinds of junk mail
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.300]   from him and whatnot, because you have to give him
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.140]   your address.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.880]   I'd rather just give it here, fix my car, here's money.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.800]   It's done, it's simple.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.960]   I don't have to give you my name.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.120]   I don't have to give you my address.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.460]   I don't have to give you my phone number.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.640]   I just want my car fixed.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.480]   That's it.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.040]   Once the car is fixed, I'm done.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.940]   I don't have to have all of that data.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.080]   All of the data on a credit card, all the data
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.800]   on a debit card, all of that data is shared
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.080]   among hundreds of companies in the financial sphere.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.600]   So I have no personal privacy on anything that I buy,
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.760]   because all the data, if I swipe a Chase credit card
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.360]   or an American Express, it's all sold and shared
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   across the industry.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.100]   And so it creates a spending profile.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.600]   So I'd rather avoid all of that.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.040]   There are major reasons for it,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.980]   the least of which involves taxes.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.080]   Now, I like the fact that I can personally
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.520]   be a little bit of an activist,
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.260]   and I can force a question of conscience
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.320]   on another person by paying cash.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.140]   Now, if the person reports the income to the government,
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.800]   then I force them to physically manually pay taxes on it,
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.220]   which forces them to consider what they're getting for it,
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.540]   which is really important.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.040]   So by paying cash to somebody who's used
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.280]   to having all their money deducted,
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.200]   I can force them to know you have to write a check
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.180]   on April 15.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.120]   I like that.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.200]   I wish I could force every person in the world
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.000]   to have to write a check on April 15.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.400]   Then Uncle Sugar, instead of being seen as this great thing
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.640]   of, "Oh, I just can't wait till I get my tax refund."
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.880]   Half the population in the United States thinks
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.480]   that Uncle Sugar is out for them
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.240]   because they get a tax refund on April 15.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.780]   I wish every person had to write at least a modest check
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.560]   so there could actually be some recognition
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.120]   of I'm paying money.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.100]   So I can force that by paying it.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.300]   That makes me happy.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.080]   Now, what if the person doesn't pay tax on the money?
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:34.920]   What if they don't report it?
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.880]   They just take the cash and they put it in their pocket?
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.740]   Well, not on my conscience.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.720]   That's up to them.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.460]   I'm happy if the government has less money.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.680]   Now they're forced to be more efficient
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.840]   with what they do have.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.680]   And more importantly now,
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.460]   there's no way that person can,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.480]   without becoming an incredible hypocrite,
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.400]   advocate for higher taxes on me or on you.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.980]   They're the ones who now have to sit down and say,
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.940]   "Oh, I'm choosing not to pay taxes
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.240]   "and I'm choosing to keep this money quiet
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.600]   "and keep it in my pocket here
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.340]   "that Joshua just gave to me.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.020]   "Why should I tell somebody else
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.660]   "that they have to pay more money?"
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.780]   Now, they know they're cheating on their taxes.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.220]   So if they know they're cheating on their taxes,
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.620]   how can their conscience allow them
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.780]   to simultaneously vote for
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.500]   and advocate for more tax on others?
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.820]   I think hypocrisy is hard to stomach for a long time.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.720]   Maybe there are some people who are genuine psychopaths
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.960]   who can handle all of these moral,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.520]   they can handle moral hypocrisy.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.280]   Most people can't though, I don't think.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.920]   So one thing or another has to break.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.000]   So I can, by just simply paying cash,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.640]   I can force a crisis of conscience on them.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.640]   What are they gonna do with it?
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.440]   And that makes me happy.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.080]   I don't see any problem with that.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.940]   So, it's kind of a ranty, forgive me,
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   but there are major, major benefits of doing this.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.480]   And I don't expect it to have any kind of impact.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.720]   I don't.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.560]   I hope it does,
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.480]   but maybe I'll influence a couple dozen people,
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.160]   but that's about it.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.840]   But it still makes me feel good by doing that.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.920]   And I need, and there are, again,
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.280]   tons of other benefits of paying cash.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.880]   One of the things I'm most concerned about
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.920]   is that more and more financial institutions
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.720]   are getting involved in activism.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.640]   I find that insane that Bank of America says,
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.080]   we're not gonna process gun sales manufacturers.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.480]   We're not gonna let you use our services.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.280]   We're not gonna let you bank with us.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.780]   It's insane.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.420]   And it's a major, major danger
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.540]   because if everything gets digitized,
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.380]   well, how do individuals do business with one another?
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.500]   Now, there'll always be solutions.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.220]   I've done all kinds of business in black markets
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.060]   all over the world.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.260]   There's always a method of transaction.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.740]   There's always a method of exchange,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.580]   whether it's a box of food,
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.180]   whether it's cryptocurrency,
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.660]   whether it's a silver coin,
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.980]   whether it's a stack of cash, we don't know.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.180]   There'll always be an opportunity,
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.740]   but it makes it a lot harder
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.740]   when you have this kind of activism
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.460]   is what's happening in the United States.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.060]   Now, forgive me if that was too ranty.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.080]   I'll try to just give you a few ideas
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:12.080]   on what I think is the ideal expressions of government.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.420]   And I'll explain to you why.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.740]   I think it's ideal.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.720]   And to just be a little bit philosophical,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   you can consider if you like any of these ideas,
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.300]   but they're not gonna be accepted this year,
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.080]   maybe a century from now, who knows.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.820]   But here is what I think,
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.700]   how I think the government should be properly diminished
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.680]   and limited.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.900]   First, a comment for my anarchist friends.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.340]   I personally am not an anarchist.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.340]   And the reason is because I'm a Christian
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.220]   and because I affirm the authority of the Bible.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.160]   And the Bible makes very clear
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.500]   that government is a gift from God
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.180]   and that government has a specific function.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.340]   That specific function is to punish evil doers
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.540]   and to serve as a restraint against evil in a society.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.340]   Doesn't give any license beyond that,
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.720]   but that is the specific function.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.880]   And you see that in Romans chapter 13,
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.280]   one of the important passages on government,
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.900]   you see very clearly that as Paul is writing
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.660]   to the Romans, he simply says
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.140]   that would you have no fear of government
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.580]   and do what is right for government
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.780]   is a terror to the evil doer.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:21.060]   And so there has to be a mechanism of restraint
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.700]   against an evil doer.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.900]   And that in my opinion is the proper role of government.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.500]   That doesn't give license for everything else.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.660]   And so my anarchist friends and I
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.340]   would have lots of things in common,
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.300]   but it does mean that I do affirm
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.260]   that there is a position for and a place for government.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:42.460]   Now, to the extent that a population of people
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.660]   has fewer evil doers and less evil being done,
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.860]   you have less and less of a need for government.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:53.780]   So if you can help people to no longer be evil doers,
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.180]   to no longer be sinning,
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.660]   to no longer be abusing their neighbors,
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.500]   to no longer be killing and raping and stealing
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.180]   and harming others and breaking their word, et cetera,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.440]   then you have a diminished need for government.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.620]   But we all expect that there will always be some people
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.220]   who are not restrained
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.780]   by their own individual self-government.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.220]   And so because of that,
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.940]   there needs to be an external civil government
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.660]   that is involved in the restraint of those people
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.540]   and that is involved in the punishment of those people.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.360]   So that's the first thing.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   Now, if we affirm that we have a basis for government,
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.580]   then we could say,
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.700]   how would we know what's the right kind of government
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.520]   to have?
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.340]   And I think that if we're gonna reason with this
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.900]   with moral philosophy,
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.700]   we should stop and simply bring things down
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.460]   to a level that we can understand.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.480]   'Cause I have no concept of how to deal
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.740]   with 300 million people or half a billion people
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.660]   or a billion people.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.900]   It seems impossible to even think about that sometimes.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.180]   But if you take things down to an individual level
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.600]   and to a community level,
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.080]   you can start to see perhaps some principles
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.260]   that can be extended out to a broader example.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.300]   So I like to do that
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.140]   because it helps me to understand
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.000]   things that are morally permitted
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.420]   and things that are morally not permitted.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:12.220]   It's morally instructive to collapse an action by society
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.620]   into a small neighborhood or to an individual level
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.380]   to understand if something is morally right or not.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.480]   And then once you're clear on what's morally right
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.800]   or morally wrong,
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.460]   then you can understand and say,
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.260]   well, how could this be extrapolated to a larger society?
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.340]   So let's give it an example.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.900]   Let's pretend that you and I
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.460]   are part of a small neighborhood
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.660]   and for use of a beautiful metaphor,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.940]   we're part of a small neighborhood
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.460]   on a desert island somewhere.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.900]   And there are a total of a dozen families in the community.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.660]   You lead one family, I lead another family.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.140]   There are a total of a dozen of us.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.860]   And let's talk through some different things
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.340]   that could happen in the community.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.620]   Let's begin with the clearest example.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.580]   First, assume that one of the men in the community
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.780]   murders another man.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:57.100]   It's unfortunate, but it has happened throughout history.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.140]   From the very beginning of history all the way to the end,
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.700]   there are going to be people who are murdering other people.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.740]   So we hear about it.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.100]   And for the sake of a good clean illustration,
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.380]   let's assume the facts are crystal clear.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.740]   We have at least two reliable witnesses
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.100]   who witnessed the murder.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.860]   We know what happened prior to the murder.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.500]   We know exactly how the murder happened
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.620]   and we know the aftermath of the murder.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.500]   Even better, we have physical evidence
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.660]   that corroborates the testimony of those witnesses.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.800]   So we're confident that the witnesses
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.060]   are not bringing false witness against their neighbor.
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.820]   We're confident in their words.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.160]   Well, what do we do?
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.180]   In this situation, we bring our community together
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.680]   and we hold a public trial of the accused.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.580]   We put together a community of jurors.
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.140]   We have somebody who facilitates the proceedings
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.320]   and keeps order in the proceedings.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.040]   We make sure that we protect the rights of the accused.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.280]   We assume that they are innocent until proven guilty.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.800]   We protect their rights.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.160]   We listen to the witnesses.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.680]   We listen to the evidence.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.280]   And then with deliberation, we make our verdict.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.120]   Now, we need to make sure that we follow due process.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.000]   One of the things I build and try to build and understand
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.120]   build most of my philosophy on the biblical precedent.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.240]   The biblical precedent requires
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.920]   there always be two witnesses.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.760]   And that's super, super important.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.280]   Without two witnesses, the person goes free.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.800]   One witness is not enough.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.080]   And the idea here is that it's a much more fearful thing
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.200]   to condemn an innocent man
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.520]   than it is to have a guilty man go free.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.040]   'Cause the guilty man still has to deal with his conscience
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.320]   and the guilty man still has to face God someday
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.560]   at the final judgment.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.720]   But an innocent man who is condemned,
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.760]   that's a fearful thing.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.080]   And that weight falls on the people.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.840]   One of the things I have a great interest in
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.960]   is I've watched a lot of the justice projects
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.600]   and the different things where people are going back
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.120]   and opening old cases.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.080]   And you wanna have your heart torn out.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.040]   Just go back and find all the people
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:49.320]   who after decades are released from prison
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.440]   and proven to be not guilty,
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.000]   proven to be innocent of the crime
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.760]   that they were convicted of.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.240]   Finding the people that were executed
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.120]   and yet later you find that they were truly not guilty.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   Even people who confess to a crime
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.440]   and find out why did they confess to a crime.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.360]   And it'll sure put a soberness in your heart
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.560]   and a humility in your thinking to say,
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.440]   we're not so good at judging truth as we should be.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.760]   So I'm not a lawyer, maybe someday I will be,
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.160]   but I study all this stuff out.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.880]   But there should be a very, very high standard of evidence
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.440]   to convict somebody of guilt.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.680]   Better for a guilty person to go free
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.160]   than for an innocent person to be convicted.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.080]   But assume here in our beautiful case,
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.680]   there is a clear guilty verdict,
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.000]   we have good evidence,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.880]   then we, in this case, what's the proper punishment?
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.200]   Well, the proper punishment for murder is execution.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.120]   So as a community, we come together
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.640]   and we execute the murderer.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.080]   And that should be done, in my opinion,
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.480]   it should be done in a way that's public,
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.240]   should be done in a way that's close to the event,
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   not like the United States,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.840]   where if you're rich, you never get executed,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.760]   but if you're poor, you get executed a decade later.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.440]   It should be equal to all people.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.760]   And my opinion, I think it should be done in a way
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.280]   that the community sees it and knows it
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.800]   and has to bear the moral weight,
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.640]   the moral responsibility of that.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.040]   I don't like how the United States executions
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.560]   are hired out to some hired killer
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.880]   to do the lethal injection
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.320]   in a locked away prison somewhere.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.160]   I think the community,
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.920]   if the community is going to come together
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.400]   and do something as morally weighty
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.120]   as condemn somebody to death,
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.000]   then we should all have to face that.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Because it's, what a horrific and awful thing.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.440]   We should face that, straightforward and not flinch at it.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:30.280]   Now, back on track.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.080]   So, in my opinion, this is a proper function of government.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.880]   This is a proper, this is a kind of thing
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.840]   where you need government
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.440]   and you have a community of people coming together.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.560]   Now, what needs to happen is when you then take it out
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.320]   to a larger degree, you can understand
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.440]   how there starts to be a division of labor.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.480]   In our little community of a dozen people,
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.000]   we would understand that there would be a murder
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.600]   every four generations.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.720]   This is not something that's happening every week.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.840]   But if our community grows
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.360]   to be now many thousands of people,
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.160]   we might have things like a murder
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.840]   or much more minor crimes,
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.920]   which is the majority of judicial disputes,
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.160]   happening more frequently.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.320]   And so now, as your community expands,
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.800]   you have a much higher division of labor.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.360]   And then, and that division of labor
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   starts to also apply to governmental functions.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.720]   In our dozen family community,
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.840]   we don't need a full-time judge.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.880]   You don't need a police officer.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.680]   You don't need any of this kind of thing.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.280]   But if we're a hundred families,
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.760]   things start to dig in, start to expand.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.560]   If we're a thousand families, if we're 10,000,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.760]   if we're a million people,
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.600]   now you start to have a specialized division of labor.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.680]   But the moral principle still remains.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.360]   It goes from the community of a dozen people
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.360]   to a community of a hundred million people.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.080]   It's just that you have an increased specialization of labor
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.840]   as things grow out.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.160]   Now, let's go on to something different.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.000]   Next scenario.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:46.840]   What's the second thing?
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.600]   Let's assume that one of the men in our little community
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.640]   of a dozen people steals his neighbor's property.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.120]   So one man goes, steals the property from another person.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.360]   Now, again, we need a trial and evidence.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   We need witnesses.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.760]   We need maybe a confession.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.160]   We need to find the property,
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.600]   but assume that we've had a trial,
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.080]   we've had evidence, and the thief is guilty.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.800]   Well, in that situation, the community must come together
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.200]   and compel the criminal, the guilty person,
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.600]   to make restitution for his crime.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.840]   So the original property needs to be restored
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.520]   to the person it was stolen from,
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.000]   plus additional bonus for restitution.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.360]   And what that system does is it compensates the victim
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.120]   for the loss of their property.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   It compensates the victim for the loss of their property,
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.400]   makes them whole again,
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.560]   and then the additional restitution does two things.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.360]   It compensates the victim for making sure
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.320]   that they have an additional benefit
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.800]   for the inconvenience of having lost their property,
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.480]   and it makes sure that the criminal,
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   the person who stole it, has to pay extra,
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.400]   extra for what they've done.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.720]   It wouldn't be right if you just had
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.480]   just simply a restoration of property.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.280]   One neighbor goes to another, steals the bicycle,
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.800]   goes joyriding it in the afternoon, and then brings it back.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.240]   Well, what's the harm
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.080]   if the person just gives the property back?
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.360]   But now if that person has to go and spend three weeks
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.560]   working to make an additional bonus payment
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.760]   for restitution for their theft,
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.600]   now all of a sudden it really wasn't worth it
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.480]   for them to take the bicycle.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.640]   So the criminal needs to be made
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.040]   to pay restitution for his crime.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.240]   Now let's assume that the criminal
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.560]   doesn't wanna make restitution for his crime.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.920]   He says, "No, I'm not gonna respect you guys."
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.560]   Well, now we have the proper use of violence and force.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.320]   As a community, we come to that person
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.840]   and we say to that person, we go to their house,
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.640]   we take the property, we take it, we sell it,
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.360]   whatever we have to do to make sure
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.840]   that the judgment of the community,
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.440]   the judicial judgment is carried out.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.600]   And so even if that involves force,
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   where we all bring our guns to this person's house,
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.720]   we take their property, or we compel them into labor,
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.080]   we compel them to do hard labor for three months
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.160]   in order to earn the, for the person that they stole from,
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.000]   in order to compensate them for the crime,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.640]   we're executing justice as a community.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.120]   That is a proper function of government.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.600]   Now, let's discuss a different situation.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.240]   Let's now assume that my son is sick.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:18.440]   And unfortunately, I don't have any money to buy medicine.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.640]   And let's assume that your son is not sick,
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.480]   and what's more, you have a lot of money.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.120]   Now, can I come over to your house and quietly say,
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.560]   "Listen, can we sit and talk for a few minutes
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.720]   "on your front porch, and I tell you my son is sick,
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.540]   "and I explain to you that I don't have any money.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.960]   "Can I ask you for money?"
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.760]   Of course I can, I can ask you for money.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.880]   And you can say yes or no.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.440]   And what's more is I can come to you,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.640]   and I can say to you, "Listen, will you lend me money?
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.740]   "I need $100 to buy this medicine.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.600]   "Would you be willing to lend me this money?
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.540]   "I can pay it back to you in three months
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.680]   "after my son is better and I am able to earn the money."
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.920]   And you can say yes or no.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.040]   You can do that to me.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.600]   But what if you are not willing to give me the money,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.400]   or you're not willing to lend me the money?
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.480]   The question is this, can I bring my gun over to your house
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.460]   and point it at you and say, "Give me the money,"
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.840]   and take your money to pay for my son's medicine?
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.360]   Well, clearly, obviously you would say no.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.760]   That's wrong, you're stealing, it's immoral.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.040]   But I say, "No, but my son is sick, I really need the money."
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.080]   You would say, "No, you're stealing.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.640]   "You're pointing a gun in your neighbor's face,
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.840]   "and you're saying, 'Give me the money.'"
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.720]   And it doesn't matter what it's for.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.040]   It doesn't matter that my son is sick.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.280]   It doesn't matter that he's gonna die.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.840]   It is wrong, it is theft.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.480]   So you say, "Well, obviously that's wrong."
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.880]   Well, now here's the case.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.160]   What if, remember there's a dozen families
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.960]   in our neighborhood, what if I go to some of my neighbors
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.840]   that I have a close relationship with,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.200]   and frankly, that they don't have much money,
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.080]   but they all know that you have money,
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.160]   and I go to them and I schedule a secret meeting,
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.620]   and I say, "Listen, guys, my son is sick,
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.880]   "and I don't have money, and none of the six of you
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.040]   "have money, but there's seven of us here."
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.920]   The seven of us should go over to your house,
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.360]   'cause you're rich, and we should take the money
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.560]   to pay for my son's medicine.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.720]   So we all come over to your house,
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.360]   and we knock on the door, and there's seven of us there.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.920]   And we say, ultimately, "Listen, give Joshua the money
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.120]   "that he needs to pay for his son's medicine."
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.600]   And you say, "No, I'm not gonna do it."
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.000]   So then we go home and we get our guns,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.080]   and now there's seven people with guns
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.040]   on your front porch saying, "Give Joshua the money."
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.360]   Did the fact that the majority of us in the community
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.280]   are there asking you for the money,
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.160]   or the majority of us are there pointing guns at you
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.040]   and taking the money to pay for Joshua's son's medicine
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.020]   make it right?
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.360]   Of course not.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.920]   Obviously, it's a difficult situation.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.720]   My son's gonna die without the medicine,
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.120]   but that still doesn't make it right.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.000]   It still is not okay in that situation to use violence
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.440]   or the threat and intimidation of violence
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.800]   to get money from you just because you're rich
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.180]   and because Joshua's son is dying.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.760]   It doesn't matter the circumstances.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.640]   The point is it's the theft.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.480]   Now, there's a big difference between the seven of us
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.960]   there on your porch with guns saying,
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.520]   "Give us the money for Joshua's son,"
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.880]   versus the seven of us on the porch of the guy
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.140]   who stole from his neighbor saying, "Give us the property."
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:24.600]   If we take the property from the thief
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.640]   plus the restitution fee and restore it
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.280]   to the person who was the victim,
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.740]   all we are doing is righting something that was wrong.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.860]   If we took more property from the thief
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.020]   than what was just for the making restitution,
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.580]   then we would now be stealing from that person.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.340]   But if we just compensate the victim,
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.440]   we're now in the world of right.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.380]   But if the seven of us are there on your porch
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.700]   and we're taking your money to pay for Joshua's kid
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.620]   because Joshua doesn't have any money,
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:57.180]   we are committing theft.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.040]   I have just described to you Medicaid.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.240]   That's fundamentally what Medicaid is.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.700]   It's people looking and saying,
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.580]   "Listen, there are people who are really hurting.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.160]   "They're poor people.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.760]   "There are poor people who don't have access to a doctor.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.960]   "They can't get money for their medicine.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.780]   "And yet there are rich people who have lots of money.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.120]   "So let's a majority of us get together
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.940]   "and then send the tax man to go and take
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:25.360]   "from the rich person and then give it
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.740]   "to the person who is poor."
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.920]   That's in a moral sense what's happening.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.680]   Now I was having a conversation with a guy online recently.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.840]   He said, "Well, it's just not violence."
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.160]   No, at the end of the day,
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.040]   taxation always involves a threat of violence.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.400]   Now the vast majority of us simply pay our taxes.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.080]   So no one has ever come into my house,
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.720]   pointed a gun at my face and said, "You have to pay it."
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.980]   But here's the thing.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.060]   At the end of the day, what's actually happening?
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.640]   The end of the day, if I don't pay my taxes,
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.780]   and if it's found out, somebody rats me out to the IRS
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.220]   and says, "Joshua doesn't pay taxes."
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:03.060]   And now all of a sudden I've got an IRS auditor there
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.260]   looking at my affairs.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   And then they find enough evidence of a criminal case
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.380]   and they haul me into court
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.940]   and they bring a criminal suit against me
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.740]   because Joshua is willfully and intentionally
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.660]   committing felonious tax evasion.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.460]   I lose my case and I get locked in prison.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.460]   And the bailiff has a gun on his hip.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.060]   I get locked in prison and I can't get out
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.800]   'cause there's guys with guns guarding the door.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.620]   That is violence.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.780]   Now, if I stole from somebody,
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.220]   then you can argue it's a right application of violence.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.500]   Violence in and of itself is not right or wrong,
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.580]   just because it's violence.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.300]   All violence is not wrong.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.720]   It's the moral underlying nature of the violence
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.400]   that makes it right or wrong.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.060]   If somebody is in fear of their life
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.820]   and is in danger of being raped,
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.140]   violent defense is violence.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.300]   It is absolute violence, but it's not morally wrong.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.100]   Whereas the person who uses violence
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.260]   to take another person's life or to rape them,
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.820]   that violence is morally wrong.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.020]   And the same thing happens with taxation.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:05.180]   Taxation always involves the implicit threat of violence.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.260]   Now, let's go on and discuss a different situation.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.860]   We've just talked about Medicaid.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.300]   What about this?
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.420]   Let's assume that Joshua has an elderly parent
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.100]   who is mentally incompetent
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.520]   and not able to work to provide for their needs.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.300]   Let's assume that you have money.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.180]   Can I come over to your house and say,
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.980]   "Listen, I'm really struggling right now.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.120]   "My elderly parent is requiring a lot of time
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.540]   "and I need some money.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.540]   "Are you willing to give me some money?"
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.440]   Absolutely, I can do that.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.900]   I can come to you and ask for help.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.180]   Of course I can.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.500]   And you can look at the situation,
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.580]   you can say, "Joshua, I can see how much you're struggling.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.120]   "Tell you what, here's some money
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.420]   "and I'll give you some money to help you.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.540]   "You've been a good neighbor."
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.020]   Or, "Here, I'll let you take food from my garden."
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.180]   Or whatever, you can figure out,
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.940]   "Or I'll come over and I'll spare you once a week
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.780]   "and I'll watch your parents
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.260]   "so you can go to work," or something.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.940]   You can figure out how to help me.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.620]   That is well within my rights
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.860]   and your rights to ask you for help.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.740]   I can ask you for a loan and it's your property.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.020]   You can choose to lend it to me or not.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.780]   But can I come and take your money
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.580]   just because you have plenty of it?
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.100]   No, it's wrong.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.860]   It is theft.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.160]   Whose responsibility is Joshua's parent?
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.840]   It's not the community's responsibility,
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.200]   it's Joshua's responsibility.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.560]   It's my parent.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.700]   I'm the one who's responsible for that.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.360]   So I can't take my responsibility
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.840]   and try to shift it onto the community.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.060]   I'm the one who is responsible to care
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.440]   for my elderly parents.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.960]   And I can't just come and take your money
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.560]   because I think you have plenty.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.080]   And it's no better if I get six of my neighbors,
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.320]   and again, we don't have money
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.160]   and we all come and say,
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.640]   "Listen, Joshua's parent is not doing too well.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.660]   "We think that in the future,
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.960]   "our parent might not be doing very well either.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.800]   "Let's do this.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   "Let's all go to your house because you're rich
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.560]   "and say to you, listen,
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.000]   "there's a majority of us here.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.120]   "And so because there's a majority,
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.900]   "it makes more right 'cause we voted on it.
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.460]   "There's seven of us here.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.880]   "And we've all decided that you have to give us money
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.680]   "to pay for our parents."
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.320]   It doesn't matter that there's seven of us there
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.760]   and thus we created a majority
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.080]   and we had a majority vote.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.960]   It's still theft.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.920]   If we're telling you, you have to give us money
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.240]   and we're threatening for it to do it.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.400]   The violence is wrong.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.920]   You can come and say, you have to give us money
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.120]   but if we're not threatening you,
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.240]   you just say, "No."
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.420]   And we walk away.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.100]   But of course, that's not what we're talking about.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.240]   We of course all bring our guns
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.760]   and we point them in your face, figuratively speaking
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.860]   and we simply look at you and say,
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.720]   "Here, you have to give us the money."
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.760]   And in fear of your life, you give the money.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.280]   By the way, back to the taxation is not violent thing.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.600]   The IRS is a useful thing here.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.560]   What does the IRS do?
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.280]   If you make a transaction here
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.600]   and then you make another transaction,
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.520]   you make another transaction,
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.920]   you make another transaction
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.400]   and the final transaction and the first transaction,
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.280]   if you look at them, result in some tax savings
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.160]   that was not exactly legal
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.840]   but the fact that you put three or four transactions
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.680]   in the place muddied the waters.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.640]   Well, that's called a step transaction.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.360]   The IRS will collapse it.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.000]   They ignore all the steps in the middle
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.200]   and they look at the first step and the last step.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.940]   So when I say taxation is always violent,
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.740]   there's always a threat of violence,
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.720]   then what I'm basically doing
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.880]   is applying the step transaction doctrine of the IRS.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.200]   And saying, let's look at what actually happens.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.240]   I just collapsed it all
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.480]   from years of threatening letters, et cetera.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.760]   And I collapsed it from the demand payment,
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.520]   pay us 50% of your income
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.080]   to the final result of the bailiff,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.960]   armed bailiff marching you into prison and locking you up.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.840]   I just collapsed it.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.880]   Let's look at the moral reality of it.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.720]   It's a step transaction, let's collapse it down.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.800]   So the fact that seven of us come together
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.440]   and compel you to give us money
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.280]   because we have an elderly parent doesn't make it right.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.040]   And it doesn't make it right if we say,
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.360]   listen, we're gonna do this for the next 50 years.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.960]   So you, when you're old, if you don't have money,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.480]   we're gonna go ahead and give you systems,
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.400]   we're gonna give you money as well.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.260]   I've just described social security.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:02.880]   So these systems don't make it right.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.780]   Now, what about war?
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.880]   Because I'm trying to deal with the big expenses,
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.160]   Medicare, Medicaid, social security,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.180]   the big ones in the United States,
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.560]   biggest costs, most expensive programs.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.120]   But then the next one is military spending.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.600]   What's the right aspect of military spending?
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.440]   Is it right?
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.760]   Is it just?
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.000]   Well, if we're gonna have an answer to this one,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   we have to look at the morality and the justice of war.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.960]   And of course, there are many perspectives on this,
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.200]   many discussions on this,
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.440]   but in general, the large majority of people
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.480]   believe that self-defense is morally justified
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.680]   and morally permitted.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.580]   Whereas aggressive offensive violence
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:51.000]   is not generally morally justified or morally permitted.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.160]   That's a majority position.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.800]   There are minority exceptions.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.760]   I respect many of those exceptions,
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.240]   but the majority position at the moment,
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.440]   which doesn't make it right,
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.340]   but just trying to relay the facts as I understand them,
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.320]   would be that this, the proper thing is,
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.940]   are we dealing with self-defense or not?
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.640]   Back to my violence example.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.000]   If I come to you and I use my size, intimidation,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.480]   and weapons to commit violence against you,
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.520]   to try to cause you to do something,
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.280]   whether it's to give me money,
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.760]   whether it's to perform some act that's against your will,
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.520]   doesn't matter what it is,
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.660]   that's offensive violence, which is wrong.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.880]   You are justified in using defensive violence against me,
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.420]   necessary to a level necessary to overcome the threat.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.680]   Now, if you are in fear of your life,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.440]   that level of violence that you would have justified
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.680]   in your response would be up to and including killing me.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.040]   And you'd be morally justified in killing me.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.520]   If you're not in fear of your life,
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.780]   the level of violence must be less.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.560]   Now, if we expand that out to our community,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.240]   we have an understanding of the same moral principle
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.440]   in our dozen of us.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.320]   Let's say that our neighbors,
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.360]   we look out across the water and all of a sudden,
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.440]   the neighbors on the neighboring desert island,
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.320]   they're coming at us and they've got,
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.680]   they're in their canoes, they're in their boats,
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.600]   they've got their cannons ready,
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.920]   and they're coming to attack our desert island.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.960]   Well, in that situation, they're gonna take us,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.600]   they're gonna plunder our houses,
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.120]   they're gonna, what's the thing from the old movies?
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.560]   Plunder our women, plunder our goods.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.760]   Anyway, they're gonna steal all our stuff
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.120]   and they're gonna kill us.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.440]   Well, in that situation,
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.360]   our violent response is morally justified
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.700]   to defend ourselves.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.720]   But now, if we're the ones who look across the water
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.020]   and look at our neighbors and say, you know what?
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.600]   Our neighbors are living pretty well over there.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.320]   They got a lot of stuff, they got a lot of money,
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.600]   they got a lot of resources.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.680]   Let's take our canoes and our guns and go and attack them.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   Well, that's wrong.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:45.100]   So now let's bring money into the affair.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:50.460]   We've established that defensive violence,
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.800]   defensive military violence is morally permissible
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.660]   if our neighbors are attacking us.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:57.800]   Whereas offensive military violence,
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.540]   to go and to take their stuff is not morally permissible.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.320]   So what about the cost of repairing?
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.560]   'Cause we could look and say, you know what?
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.400]   Our neighbors are looking kind of warlike.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.840]   Maybe we should build some fortifications on our island.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.520]   Maybe we should buy some guns.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.200]   Maybe we should protect ourselves
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.760]   and that's gonna cost money.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.960]   And we can go to one another and we can say, listen,
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.640]   everybody needs to chip in $100
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.560]   'cause we need to build these fortifications here.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.960]   Well, I think most people in that situation would look
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.720]   and say, hey, this is necessary.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.480]   We should probably fortify our island
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.480]   so that we could repel an attack if necessary.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.320]   We lock our doors and our houses at night.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.840]   We arm our alarm systems.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.360]   Let's do the same thing for our islands.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.560]   Let's all chip in $100 so we can do this together.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.760]   Most people would look at that.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.160]   In a moment, I'll deal with the question
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.960]   of should we force people to do that?
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.320]   But most people would look at that and say,
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.640]   we should do that.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:48.440]   Then we could change the situation.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.360]   What if now we say, we're gonna go
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.800]   and we're gonna go and collect $100 from each of us.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.080]   We're gonna use it to buy some new boats.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.720]   We can paddle across to our neighbor's island
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.820]   and take all their stuff.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.000]   Well, you can understand why,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.880]   or I can understand why you wouldn't
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.440]   wanna participate in that.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.520]   You might look at that and say,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.720]   no, I'm not gonna give $100 for us to go
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.680]   and buy new boats to go and steal our neighbor's stuff.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.240]   That's stealing, we're not gonna do it, it's wrong.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.800]   And I think you would be justified in your position.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800]   So things like military spending
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.960]   are a little bit more complicated
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.560]   because we have to figure out,
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.280]   well, is the underlying military action right or wrong?
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.320]   And there aren't many people
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.480]   who are entirely opposed to violence.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.320]   It's just the question is,
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.040]   is it violence in self-defense of my community
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.880]   and my location, or is it offensive attacking another person
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.140]   trying to plunder their resources, plunder their country?
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.920]   And that raises some real questions.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.400]   How can my money be involved in that?
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.440]   Now let's go to roads
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.480]   and then we'll talk about compelling people.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.400]   Should the government be involved in building roads?
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.960]   Let's think of your little community of a dozen people.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.520]   We come together and we say, listen,
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.440]   it would really benefit us if we had a road
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.200]   right down the middle of our island,
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   but we need money to build the road.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.720]   And this would benefit all of us.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.480]   We think that everybody should commit money
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.280]   to build the road.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.920]   So you market the idea to your neighbors
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.040]   to gain their support.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.740]   Now, I believe one of the most important things to do
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.660]   is to gain support for your ideas peacefully,
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.080]   not to engage in violence and coercion,
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.760]   but to engage in peaceful reason,
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.200]   discussion, salesmanship,
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.720]   trying to lay out why this is in your best interest
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.680]   to do this thing.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.440]   And if it's truly in your best interest,
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.200]   I think most people, probably about 80% of the people,
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.640]   are willing to listen to reason
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.000]   and do things that are in their best interest.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.500]   Now, what about, so we take up a collection.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.800]   There's a dozen of us in there.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.260]   80% of us say, yeah, we'd like to build a road,
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.600]   but 20% of us say, no, we've got three holdouts.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.560]   Nine, four, three holdouts.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.480]   They say, no, I don't wanna pay money for that.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.760]   Question is this, should you use the threat of violence,
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.680]   taxation, against those three?
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.520]   Should you say to those three, no, listen, you're wrong.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.360]   We've all voted.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.060]   Nine of us have said, we're going to do it.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.280]   We're gonna build this road,
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.360]   and we're gonna come to your house,
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.100]   and we're gonna take $100 out of your house.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.240]   Should you do that?
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.520]   Bring your guns and force it.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.820]   Well, my answer is I say, personally, I say no,
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.400]   probably not.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.480]   Now, I'm not gonna argue these situations
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.800]   as extremely as I've argued the other,
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.700]   but I'll say that when you automatically resort
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.960]   to the threat of violence,
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   and automatically resort to taxation as your first answer,
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.720]   you miss out on a lot of other things that could be done
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.300]   that would be a lot stronger.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.400]   So for example, I could imagine,
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.100]   in our little hypothetical community of a dozen people,
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.740]   where we voted nine to three in favor of building the road,
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.360]   I could imagine that after the majority vote,
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.600]   one or two of those three say, you know what?
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.240]   I don't think we need the road,
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.840]   but I wanna be a good neighbor, so I'll participate.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.000]   But what about the one or two that still say, no,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.280]   I don't wanna have the money,
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.740]   and I don't wanna give the money?
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.520]   Should we take our guns and go take the money from them?
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.480]   I say no.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.700]   If the rest of us are convinced we need a road,
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.300]   let's go ahead and chip in a little extra
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.540]   to cover the costs.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.840]   Why do you have to force every single person
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.880]   to do what the majority want?
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.960]   Why do you have to say everybody has to do this,
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.860]   so it's not right?
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.800]   After all, in a modern progressive tax system,
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.880]   we're content with a tiny percentage,
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.540]   what, the top 10% of people paying 50% of the taxes?
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.440]   So in that situation,
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.360]   why not let the eight or nine pay for the road
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.600]   and leave the other two or three out
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.320]   that don't wanna participate?
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.860]   We already do that.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.000]   So the fact that I say,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.900]   let's not use violence and intimidation
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.780]   and coercion for this, let's just leave it alone.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.160]   We live in a system where a tiny percentage of people
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.840]   pay the vast majority of the expenses of the government.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.080]   So all we're doing is saying it differently,
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.920]   but we're just not trying to force everybody to do it.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.480]   So I say, no, let's not use force,
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.840]   or let's wait until everybody's in it.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.920]   Now, it's easy to do that in a community of 12 people.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.080]   It's harder to do that in a community of 12 million,
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.840]   but let's just wait.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.760]   Now, is it fair?
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.920]   Is it fair that not everybody chips in for the road,
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.880]   that somebody might use the road without paying for it?
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.720]   I don't know.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.520]   I don't know what,
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.400]   let's say there's two men who don't wanna contribute money.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.420]   I don't know what those two men are dealing with.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.880]   Maybe one of them would really like to build the road,
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.480]   but he'd like to put in the money,
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.440]   but his wife is sick,
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.920]   and he's spending all his money on doctors and medicine.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.040]   Question is this, should we force that person to come in
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.720]   and give us his money for the road?
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.820]   Because we've said this community needs a road,
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:36.680]   we're gonna build it,
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.420]   and now he doesn't have money to take care of his wife?
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:42.000]   I say, no.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.520]   His wife is his responsibility,
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.500]   and that's a higher priority than building a road.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.340]   Leave him alone.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.680]   Let him handle his money the way that he wants to.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.760]   The old saying, those convinced against their will
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.320]   are of the same opinion still.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.960]   Fundamentally, when you force someone
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.140]   to do something with violence,
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.080]   it basically means you've lost your case.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.720]   The vast majority of people are thoughtful.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.600]   They're good natured.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.580]   They wanna be good members of a community.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.920]   They're willing to listen to arguments
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.000]   and debate and reason.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.240]   They're willing to be a part of a public conversation,
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.460]   and they're even willing to sacrifice,
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.960]   even if they're in the minority position,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.000]   if they believe that it's the right thing to do.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.240]   They wanna be involved in a local community.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.580]   And what I see happening in the United States of America
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.760]   is that more and more, we've grown so accustomed
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.560]   to using violence and coercion and intimidation
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.200]   to get our way, that now it's basically the only way
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.820]   that people can get things done,
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.340]   is to use violence and intimidation and coercion
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.920]   to force the other people to do
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.520]   what we think you have to do.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.860]   Well, it's not helping things.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.640]   It's not making people feel like more
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.480]   of a part of a community.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.960]   It's not making people feel heard.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.780]   The United States government was designed
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.280]   to protect the rights of the minority.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.080]   And we should keep that system going
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.560]   in all of our thinking.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.960]   We should always seek to protect the rights of the minority.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.320]   It's not hard to protect the rights of majority.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.920]   History is fulfilled with societies
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.880]   that always focus on the rights of the majority.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.440]   That's easy.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.560]   But protecting the rights of the minority
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.480]   is where you have a truly just system.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.100]   Where if you're gonna use coercion
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.080]   and violence and intimidation,
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.060]   it's only in the tiniest number of circumstances
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.080]   for the most clear things.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:35.140]   Increasingly, just look at the US culture
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.460]   and what you see is that, at least what I see,
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:40.700]   one of the major problems that's systematically
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.700]   fracturing the US American culture
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.580]   is that the majority of super monumental decisions
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.240]   and legal impositions that are accomplished today
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.600]   are not achieved through the slow moving political process
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.000]   of debate and voting and building political consensus,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.800]   but through judicial decree.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:02.880]   By saying, the majority saying,
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.360]   "Ha, we got the majority.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.480]   "We're gonna force these people
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.080]   "to do what we want them to do."
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.780]   And increasingly you find people
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:13.740]   who are just not that interested in being told what to do.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.560]   No one's gonna listen to judicial decree
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.840]   if it's not dealt with politically.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.840]   Interestingly, earlier in the show,
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.280]   I alluded to the Affordable Care Act,
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.600]   when, I don't think I mentioned it,
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.880]   but long-term care.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.040]   There was, when the Affordable Care Act was passed,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.360]   I was talking about Maine, the problems with long-term care.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.560]   When the Affordable Care Act was passed,
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.400]   there was a provision in it that established
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.840]   a government run option for long-term care insurance.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.120]   I think it was called the CLASS Act, if memory is right,
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.440]   but don't quote me on that.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.200]   And I was interested in it
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.860]   'cause I was selling a lot of long-term care insurance
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.700]   at the time.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.180]   And I started learning about it.
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.020]   And what was amazing to me
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.780]   is a few months after it was passed,
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.580]   it was voided and the entire program was disappeared
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.740]   because it had been built on such faulty assumptions
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.980]   of actuarial assumptions
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.300]   that it was totally gonna be a disaster.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.700]   But the Affordable Care Act is a good example
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.320]   of something that was politically settled
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.080]   by the barest majority vote,
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.980]   and then enforced by judicial decree,
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.660]   but didn't have the political will of the people.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:16.060]   How'd that work out for you?
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:20.460]   You had a last day kind of Christmas break,
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.340]   bare majority vote with a, what was it,
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.400]   the resolution process instead of an actual
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.040]   passing the bill, reconciliation process.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.540]   Basically, by the thinnest of margins,
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:31.380]   you had this Affordable Care Act rammed through Congress.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.980]   Well, what's amazing to me is here,
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.380]   you look at it, what, a decade later,
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.760]   and you have, at least on the Democratic side,
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.420]   you have basically every single Democratic candidate
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.720]   says, "Well, that thing failed.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.640]   "It didn't work.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.060]   "It was a waste of time.
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:46.940]   "We need a new system.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.900]   "We need Medicare for all,
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.020]   "so we'll pound this down the American people's throat."
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:52.780]   Now, we can debate the reasons it didn't work.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.540]   Maybe it was bad from the beginning.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:57.740]   Maybe the hollowing out of it made it collapse.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.580]   Who knows?
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.580]   We can argue that.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.300]   My only point is look at how ineffective it is
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:05.180]   to ram things through, to use the force of law
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.900]   to force people who didn't want health insurance
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:09.540]   to go and buy health insurance
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.780]   and to otherwise pay a penalty.
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.420]   I found that, the individual mandate
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.300]   and the imposition of fees,
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.740]   I found that the most insulting, infuriating,
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:23.060]   disgusting tax ever.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:27.020]   Now, I've always maintained health insurance
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:29.560]   or health protection of some kind,
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.480]   but when you say you're gonna force me to do something,
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.340]   it makes my hackles rise
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.100]   and probably some parts of my character
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:39.500]   that still need to be worked out,
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.660]   but it makes me basically say, "Screw you.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.200]   "I'm not gonna do it.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.980]   "I'm gonna cancel my health insurance.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.180]   "I'm smart enough to read the law, find the exceptions.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.620]   "I'm not gonna maintain health insurance.
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.300]   "Screw you, I'll make you guys pay for it."
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.660]   And look at the disaster that has happened
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.220]   in the last 10 years because of this very thin
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.880]   ramming through and trying to force people
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.300]   to do what you think they ought to do
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.660]   because you think it's a good idea.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.620]   And so many of the hot political issues
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.380]   in the United States happening exactly the same way,
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:11.780]   where the political process of gaining consensus
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:15.260]   and working together and building political consensus
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:17.100]   is basically utterly broken
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.340]   and has been broken for a couple decades now.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:22.920]   Look at, I guess a good example would be,
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.420]   look at how the legalization
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.220]   of homosexual practice has happened.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.940]   From the 1600s through the 1990s in the United States,
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:32.900]   sodomy was illegal, illegal.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:36.420]   And this was as late as, I think it was 1986,
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.500]   there was a case, I think it was Bowers versus Hardwick,
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.020]   where the illegality of sodomy
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.100]   was confirmed as constitutional.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.380]   Now, those laws were largely unprosecuted and unenforced.
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:51.100]   The point is from the 1600s through the 1990s,
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.360]   sodomy was illegal.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.420]   But then you have this tiny span of time,
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.540]   about 15 to 20 years.
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.380]   In 2003, you have Lawrence v. Texas,
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.620]   which ruled all those sodomy laws unconstitutional.
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.500]   The remaining 11 states that had extant sodomy laws,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.900]   those were vacated by the court.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.980]   Then from 2003 to 2015, you have a series of court cases
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:12.780]   steadily pressing the issue forward
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.280]   until the 2015 Obergefell decision.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.460]   In 15 years, you have a series of unelected judges
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:22.680]   who systematically changed three centuries of precedent.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.160]   Question is this, how's that working out for you?
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:31.100]   Now, there was, in that 15 to 20 years,
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:32.800]   a clear change in public opinion.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.180]   I've previously talked about the public relations campaign
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:37.820]   that was necessary to accomplish that in the United States,
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:38.660]   and it was one of the most effective
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:40.500]   public relations campaigns ever.
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.260]   But my point is this, how is that working out for you?
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.640]   How's the current state of the US American society
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.340]   with regard to peaceful relationships among neighbors?
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.700]   People being able to trust their neighbors.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:56.140]   You got now lawsuits on every hand,
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.480]   sue this person 'cause they don't wanna bake this cake,
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:01.180]   sue that person 'cause they don't wanna do this thing.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.860]   You don't change people's minds with that.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.620]   All you do is create a fractured, divisive,
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.020]   untrustworthy society where people start
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:13.060]   to resent their neighbors.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:15.140]   Now, how's that gonna work out for you in the coming years
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.340]   when you try to continue to impose taxation?
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:21.280]   How's it gonna work out for you?
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.220]   Think it's gonna lead to more peace,
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.060]   more neighborly relationships,
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.800]   you forcing your will on other people,
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.340]   forcing them with coercion and violence and taxation
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.500]   to do what you think they're supposed to do?
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.860]   Think if you look at relatively recent history,
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:42.480]   you can see how fraught with danger it is
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.940]   to move with the force of law.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.940]   Now, I believe there's a place for judicial decree.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.900]   I support the judicial state.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:54.120]   I think that bad laws should be ruled as unconstitutional.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.660]   I think there can be times where things are right,
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.580]   times where things are wrong.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.540]   Just because something is settled doesn't mean it's right.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.340]   I believe I'm not opposed to the judiciary functioning.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:09.100]   What I'm saying is if you look at a society,
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.300]   look at the United States of America society,
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.820]   and you soberly ask yourself,
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.700]   how's it going trying to force other people
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.400]   to do what I think they should do?
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.320]   When you just use courts and use laws
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.560]   that are inherently forcing other people,
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.080]   you wind up with a dangerous, fractured society.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.700]   So my point is simply this.
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:33.740]   We should be very careful, very restrained
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:38.340]   before we ever try to use force on our neighbors,
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:40.900]   before we ever try to coerce somebody
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:42.140]   to doing what I think they should do
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:44.100]   just because I think they should do it.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.060]   If I'm in that community of a dozen people
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:51.060]   and I think we need a road, and nine of us agree,
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:52.980]   if I'm in the community and I think we need a road
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.780]   and three of us agree and nine of us don't,
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.620]   let's say I'm in the three,
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.900]   nine of us say, no, we don't need the road.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.940]   I'm just gonna keep on lobbying, right?
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:01.860]   I'm gonna keep saying, listen,
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.380]   here are all the ways that would benefit us,
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.700]   and in time, maybe I'll win you to my position,
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.140]   but I don't have the right to come and tell you
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.200]   you have to do it this way.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.060]   Now, if nine of us agree we need the road
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.740]   and three of us don't, I still don't see much benefit
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.540]   in forcing the three to participate.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:18.940]   Let's be gentle.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.180]   Let's not coerce other people to do our will.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:25.300]   I'm not gonna advocate for forcing our neighbors to do it.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:28.660]   Now, to wrap up this show,
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:32.220]   I don't know exactly how a lot of these things hold up.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.020]   When you go from Joshua's fantasy metaphor
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:39.540]   of a dozen people on a island nation
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.040]   to a 21st century mega city with 23 million people in it,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.100]   I'm not trying to do anything other than to talk
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.540]   about the underlying thing.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:52.380]   I'm not advocating one way or the other.
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:53.940]   If all the government did was build roads
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.940]   and arrange for a proper court system,
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.520]   fine, I'll pay it and move on.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.900]   But my argument is this.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:05.500]   The majority of the functions of our modern governments
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.580]   are built on institutionalized immorality.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:12.220]   Instead of government that exists,
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.180]   that's commissioned to provide justice,
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:17.520]   to provide relief and restitution for the victims of crime,
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.340]   where you have a victim that can bring a lawsuit
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.660]   and say, "I was wronged,"
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.980]   that's the proper function of government.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.540]   Instead of that, we live in political systems
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:32.900]   that are based upon encouraging sin and immorality.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.420]   Politicians encourage covetousness,
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.580]   teaching people that they're entitled
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:37.780]   to the property of others.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:39.140]   Listen, if you vote for me,
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.940]   we'll make sure that we soak those people
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:43.540]   for what they owe us.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.760]   That's covetousness.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.020]   And theft by majority vote.
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:49.860]   If you'll just vote for me,
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:52.180]   I'll make sure we go get some of their property for you
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.900]   and I'll reward you for it.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.260]   That doesn't work.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:58.020]   That's not gonna have long-term success.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.860]   It was not always this way in the United States.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.820]   I can't comment on European history
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.700]   and I don't know all the demarcation points,
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:07.580]   but I understand American history pretty well.
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.920]   Was not always this way in the United States.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.560]   There was a sociologist, Robert Nisbet,
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.980]   one time in an essay,
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.780]   remarked that in the year he was born, 1913,
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.860]   the only contact that most Americans had
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.420]   with the federal government was the post office.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.540]   And it was later that year
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:25.100]   that the Federal Reserve Act was passed
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.860]   in a late session just before Christmas break.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.860]   And that was when the income tax came into effect.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.340]   And since that time,
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.900]   the ongoing never-ending expansion
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.340]   of the federal government has just continued.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.920]   And it will, in my guess,
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.960]   it will probably continue until bankruptcy.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.260]   So what do we do?
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.460]   I think we just start by repenting of our own sin,
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.780]   of our own covetousness and theft,
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:54.780]   and rebuking it wherever it comes.
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.740]   If I see that I'm looking over at that guy
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.380]   'cause he's richer than me,
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.340]   and I'm saying that, well,
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:03.500]   he owes me money because he's richer, that's wrong.
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:07.380]   And so I have to stop by saying, I'm not gonna do that.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:08.880]   And if a politician comes along
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.580]   and tries to stir up my covetousness
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:11.740]   for another person's property
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.860]   and make me greedy for another person's property,
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.980]   I acknowledge what they're doing
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.580]   and I rebuke them and say, stop.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:21.840]   If they earned their property lawfully and justly,
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.700]   without stealing from others, that's their business.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.580]   Their property is not mine.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:28.660]   Now, if they've stolen from others,
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:29.940]   whether through whatever means,
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.500]   whether through outright theft,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.260]   through abuse of contracts or something,
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:37.580]   something that's theft, and that needs to be righted.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.740]   And there's plenty of that.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.900]   Rich people are not all rich
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.620]   because they're all just virtuous people.
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.740]   There's a whole lot of theft that's gone on.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:47.900]   And nothing that I'm saying is going to change that.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.260]   I'm not saying there's not a place for us
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:52.880]   to stand up against people who are stealing from others.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.800]   But I gotta start with myself.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:59.460]   I gotta start by controlling those impulses that I have
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.600]   of greed and covetousness and a desire to steal from others.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.240]   And then not trying to vote for things like that.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.720]   Beyond that, I teach my children
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.960]   not to be greedy for other people's property,
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.280]   to be proud of working
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.200]   and generating the property of their own
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.240]   through honest, peaceful trade and commerce
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.740]   with other people, voluntary relationships with people,
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:23.220]   not trying to use intimidation and force to get their way.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.380]   And then I focus on helping my neighbor,
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.340]   loving my neighbor, encouraging them the same way,
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.460]   and then helping them
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:32.220]   so they won't be greedy for another man's property.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.980]   If your neighbor has a need, you gotta solve that need.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:37.740]   What's bad is if your neighbor is struggling
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:39.340]   with a sick son,
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:42.140]   if your neighbor is struggling with an incompetent parent,
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.100]   and then you're not there as a community,
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:46.540]   well, of course they're gonna vote
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.680]   to try to get some of your money
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.920]   'cause you're not standing up and helping them.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.280]   That foundation though,
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.680]   when you build a society on covetousness and greed
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.400]   is not a stable society to make.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.960]   It's breaking down in the United States,
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.760]   it's breaking down in Europe.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:04.360]   You have increasing tension,
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.400]   you have increasing racial tension,
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.400]   you have increasing political tension,
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.060]   you have increasing political instability.
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:14.300]   I think you could trace some of this
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:16.040]   to some of those problems.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:19.180]   (birds chirping)
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.800]   It's a major moral hazard.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:26.540]   So that's my idea.
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:27.860]   It's kind of what I think would be
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.780]   an ideal system of government,
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.080]   a judicial system that settles disputes
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.880]   and seeks to protect victims.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.740]   You feel free to consider these ideas.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:38.540]   I don't ask you to agree with me.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.020]   Not lobbying for you to join me in anything.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.580]   Just consider the ideas.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:44.740]   And then if you like any of these ideas,
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.620]   start imposing them in your own life.
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:49.900]   I'd say the biggest thing is simply,
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:51.340]   if you have the choice,
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:56.220]   stop engaging in coercion or violence towards other people
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:01.220]   and engage in peaceful speaking, reason,
[01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:05.460]   preaching, entreaties, engage in those things
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:08.160]   and stop participating in all the rest of that stuff.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:12.660]   When you can win converts to your ideas
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:15.460]   where people don't feel coerced,
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.140]   don't feel trapped by you in some way,
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.300]   don't feel intimidated by you,
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.780]   they just freely choose to become a convert to your ideas,
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:26.300]   you can build a powerful neighborhood.
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.260]   You can build a powerful community.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:30.620]   But when you engage in forcing other people,
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.140]   basically as I see it,
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:36.460]   people will retreat to entrenched tribalism
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.060]   and that stinks.
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:41.900]   So those are my answers to my listener.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.140]   Why so anti-tax?
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.540]   Well, it's because of this, not anti-tax.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.540]   And I do, I wish I weren't so loud mouthed
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:52.740]   in some of my opinions.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:55.540]   I have moderated, I have become much more relaxed.
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.980]   For me, once I found the escape clauses,
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:02.580]   now I spent 10 years studying tax.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.220]   I remember when I was a new financial advisor
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.140]   and I remember the first time,
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:10.340]   here I am, I'm licensed, I'm selling insurance,
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.820]   I'm selling investments and whatnot.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:14.260]   And I remember the first tax time I sat down
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:16.580]   with an accountant to do my taxes,
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.300]   I didn't have a clue how a tax return worked.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.980]   Did not have a clue.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.020]   Nothing had prepared me for it,
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.500]   I hadn't done it previously, I didn't have a clue.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.220]   But I started working at it.
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:30.020]   And I would say in the last year,
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.380]   I had a number of epiphanies where finally,
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.180]   I understood how to follow the law
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.380]   and yet how to totally break out of the tax system.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.700]   Today, I've worked out how I could earn 10 million bucks
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:43.820]   a year and not legally not pay a dime of income tax.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:47.180]   I've worked out how to save taxes on capital gains tax,
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:48.660]   so that we're all that stuff.
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:51.180]   Now, whether I hope I'd like to earn 10 million bucks
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.660]   this year, but at the moment, we're not on track for that.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.820]   But so I'm tiki-hawking theoretically,
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:58.140]   but once I found kind of the escape clauses,
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:01.780]   once I worked it out, and I followed and worked out
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.180]   how to follow the law carefully and strictly,
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:07.060]   'cause I feel a special burden being in a kind
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.060]   of a loud mouth voice.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:10.780]   I assume whenever I file a tax return,
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.340]   I assume it's gonna be published on the front page
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.100]   of a local newspaper.
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.940]   And so it better be exactly right.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.100]   But once I worked out the escape clauses,
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.300]   once I worked out how I could peacefully
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.820]   and voluntarily disassociate myself
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.700]   and remove myself from the system
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.580]   without engaging in violence,
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:31.940]   without engaging in revolutionary conduct, et cetera,
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.180]   I moderated a lot.
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:34.900]   It helped me to be a lot more relaxed.
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:38.020]   It lost a lot of my anger and frustration.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:40.380]   Maybe, maybe that's in the first half of the show
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.980]   was pretty ranty.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:43.860]   Maybe there's still a bit more there than I'd like.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.940]   Hopefully in a few years, I'll be much more sanguine
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.620]   about the whole thing.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.580]   So I apologize if I push too hard
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:52.260]   or if I go too hard to the line.
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:54.260]   I get tired of seeing people abused.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.140]   And as far as I'm concerned,
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:58.780]   it's just another expression of bullying.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:35:59.740]   I hate bullying.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.900]   I hate bullies.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:03.380]   And I hate it when you have a majority of people
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.460]   that say, "Oh, we're gonna vote ourselves
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.500]   somebody else's money
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.660]   because we think that they should have it."
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:13.060]   And it causes me to be, I feel so angry
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.740]   when I look at these bullies.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:17.340]   And I watch political candidates who are bullies
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.220]   and they use the power of the vote
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.460]   to try to, and the power of the pen
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.460]   and the power of the government
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.900]   to try to force people to do things.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:26.740]   And I think at some point,
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.820]   can we get to a society
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:31.020]   where people just simply leave peacefully with one another
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.740]   and don't force others to do it?
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.980]   I've experienced it certainly, thankfully,
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:36.940]   in my local church.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:39.860]   And you can experience the freedom
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.940]   that comes within a local community
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:45.460]   of like-minded people who live and let live and whatnot.
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.380]   But I get so tired of the public debate
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:51.860]   and the bullies who think that they can toss around
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.180]   the power of the government.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.700]   It's the bullies and it infuriates me.
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.100]   So I apologize if I get emotional sometimes.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.580]   That's the underlying emotion that reflects out.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.540]   But I hope to be more sanguine in the future.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.820]   Hope to be careful with my words.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:04.740]   I don't wish to,
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:07.740]   I'm happy to live and die by the words that I believe,
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.140]   but I don't wanna live and die by carelessness.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.100]   And so I hope that I'll be,
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.860]   learn to increasingly control my tongue
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.380]   and be much more sanguine about the whole thing.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:17.460]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.460]   What should I plug as I go?
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.460]   Oh, I guess, well,
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.700]   I had a bunch of you that reached out to me
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.340]   for more personal consultations.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.980]   As I mentioned in, I think, the previous show,
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:27.140]   my life has stabilized more
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:30.140]   and I'm able to do more personal consulting work.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:31.260]   So if you would be interested
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.180]   in any kind of personal consulting work,
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:36.260]   I promise I won't talk your ear off about this nonsense.

[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.700]   and 5% theoretical for fun,
