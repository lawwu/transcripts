[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Pastor John, in the last podcast you talked about the importance of the
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.040]   historicity of Adam in the local church especially. In this episode I want to
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240]   follow up and ask you about Adam in relationship to global missions. Why does
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.520]   the historicity of Adam matter for missionaries? When I was preaching through
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.600]   Romans, this is now what, eight or nine years ago, probably more than that, took me eight years to get
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:36.320]   through. I got to chapter 5 and I had never thought before that time how
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:47.520]   amazingly relevant Romans 5, 12 to 21 is missiologically. It begins just as sin
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.280]   came into the world through one man and death through sin and so death spread to
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.880]   all men for all have sinned and then he goes on to compare Adam and Christ as
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.280]   the heads of two different humanities. All of us are in Adam because he's
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.280]   our head and those of us who receive the grace that is in Christ Jesus are in
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.760]   Christ Jesus and thus he's our new head creating a new humanity. What that
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.120]   said to me was every single tribe, every people group in the world, thousands of
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.520]   them, if you go in there and learn their language and learn their culture and
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040]   find a way to communicate with them you never have to fear that the message you
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.080]   bring is somehow irrelevant for them in their culture because they all, you can
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.880]   tell them this, you preach this, there was an original human being from which we
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.880]   all came. That's the way Paul goes about it in Acts 17. And your problem is
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.560]   exactly the same as my problem because your great-great-great-great-great-great-
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840]   great-great-grandfather rebelled against the Creator God and he fell in sin, has
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   been bent against this God ever since and that God has sent his son Jesus
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120]   Christ into the world so that that disobedience could be remedied through
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.560]   his perfect obedience and through the death by which he covers all the sins.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.840]   That structure of thinking of justification through Christ and
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.600]   condemnation through Adam is not culturally conditioned. You may have to
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.400]   find words to say it but that reality is universal. That's why this
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.240]   teaching is so amazingly relevant for missions because missions is dealing
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.080]   with how can we present good news to people who know nothing, they don't know
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.840]   anything about the story of Christianity and we can root that story in their
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.440]   original father and our original father and the Son of Christ, of God
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.760]   coming into the world and bearing the guilt of their father and our father and
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.320]   so it crosses cultures in a remarkable way. That means that when missionaries
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.840]   prepare for wherever they're going, their focus shouldn't be merely on linguistics
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.520]   and anthropology and culture. There's so much emphasis today on believing that
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   that our success is going to hang on whether we are savvy enough in all of
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.840]   those mythological dimensions and those are important. I don't want to
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.760]   minimize them but theology and understanding the scriptures in
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.000]   particular Romans 5 that we've just talked about is really crucial so
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.040]   missionaries should be people who really care about this kind of biblical
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.240]   theology because when they grasp what the Bible really says they will find
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.840]   themselves not just on this issue but on many issues amazingly able to tap in to
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.280]   the very nature of the people they're talking about because the Bible is so
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.640]   profoundly rooted in what is real and what is true. It's never going to be
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.760]   irrelevant to devote yourselves to the study of the scriptures as well as all
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.120]   the cultural dimensions of preparation. Thank you Pastor John, and for more on
