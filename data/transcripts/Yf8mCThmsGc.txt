[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   the difference between a continental and maritime power, and that's one of my big career takeaways.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.440]   It's a fundamentally different way of looking at the world. So Putin honestly looks at the world
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   that if I control territory, that's what makes me secure. Maritime powers, they start with Britain,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.640]   which is, "Hey, mine's secure if I can maximize money from commerce, because then I can buy navy
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.960]   and buy allies with armies and stuff. They want to run transactions by law, etc." That this is
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   an international order that's win-win. You join it, you get security, you have input on
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.520]   how it evolves because it's a work in progress. Whereas this continental thing is negative sum.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.560]   And you can see it in Ukraine. So Putin wants more territory. Okay, he's got a zone. He took
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:57.440]   the eastern Ukraine and he took Crimea in 2014, but it's negative sum because he destroys whatever
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.240]   businesses have been being run in Donbass, and he absolutely kills most of the tourist industry.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.440]   And then you could look right today, it's so negative sum in Ukraine. He is destroying wealth
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.440]   at a really rapid clip. It's really a stupid way to run, too. And if you go up to Taiwan,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.760]   so if PRC tries to take Taiwan, it's a continental view, more territory,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.120]   somehow we think it's going to improve our security. No, they'll level it. And they'll
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.320]   hurt themselves. Whereas if they just ignore the Taiwan thing and say, "Oh, they're so annoying.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.640]   Let them run their own place. Who wants them anyway?" And then trade with them, they'll both
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.280]   make money. And so when I look at this, that's my biggest career takeaway, is that if we go through
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.720]   international law and international institutions, and this is not a hedge. Political scientists love
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.240]   to talk about, "Ah, America, the hegemon," right? No other country in the world wants an American
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.280]   hegemon. There may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great, but no one's
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.800]   going to buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.280]   else around. I get it, we're big and we're influential. Other people are influential, too.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.840]   But this maritime order where, yeah, we're an important part of it, but have many other people
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.120]   in it, it's a win-win. And you can look at some with Biden right now, he's doing all of these
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:37.440]   meetings with Europeans of managing of what's going to go on in Ukraine, etc. And it's based
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   on agreement of all these different countries chipping in big and small. And who's prosperous
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.920]   and who's not, may I ask? Yeah, they are. And who are the ones who have massively increased
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.080]   their standards of living since the Cold War? It was really the third world. Except now we got
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.520]   Wagner or whatever's left of it. And also China's now got these private military things running
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.760]   roughshod over Africa, which all that's going to do is tank African growth rates, which for a while
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.640]   are going double digit. So that's one of my big career takeaways.
