[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Here's a question from a pastor.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.600]   "Pastor John, how did you maintain your personal awe of God throughout your three decades of
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   ministry?
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   Have you ever burned out?
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.160]   Have you ever gone through dry seasons?
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.320]   And if so, how did you get out of it?"
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.240]   I have gone through very dark and cold seasons, and I want to make sure that when I say that,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:34.880]   people realize we're not talking about a simple two-phase Christianity, like there's really
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:44.200]   red-hot, devoted, vital Christianity, and then there's cold, dead, dark Christianity.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.360]   The fact is, there are infinite gradations in between those two extremes, and so I would
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.880]   say I'm in and out of those daily.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.080]   It's not like, "Oh, back in '78 there was a season."
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   It's like I get up needing to become alive, and my strategy has been the same pretty much
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.840]   all the way along in trying to fight this fight for joy, and that is to pray earnestly
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.800]   while I look at the Bible.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.400]   So those two things, my faith is set towards God's Word, because it says in 1 Samuel 3:21,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.680]   "He revealed himself to Samuel through the Word of the Lord."
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960]   And I want to see Jesus.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960]   I need Jesus.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.800]   I don't need merely propositions.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.280]   I need an encounter with the living Christ, and I believe it comes through the Word, and
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.640]   yet I'm staring at the Word and it's not happening, right?
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640]   So I'm staring at the Word.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.200]   I don't say, "Okay, the Word doesn't work.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   I'll go somewhere else."
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.040]   I keep staring at the Word and praying my favorite acrostic, "I O U S."
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.120]   Incline my heart to your testimonies, O God.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   Open my eyes to see wonderful things.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.080]   Unite my heart to fear your name.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.760]   Satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   I O U S.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.160]   That's my prayer virtually every day over the Word of God.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   And the paradigm in the Psalms for helping me cope with seasons of downness is Psalm
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.280]   40, which says, "I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.120]   He heard my cry.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.720]   He lifted me up out of the desolate pit, out of the miry bog.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.240]   He put my feet upon a rock and made my step secure.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.040]   He put a new song in my mouth.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.720]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.680]   Now, he was in the pit.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.120]   It was a miry bog, and it says he was waiting.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.560]   And how long was he waiting?
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   I'm so glad it didn't say two days or a week.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.160]   It left it open because you may be in that miry bog for months, but the key there is
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.680]   I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.560]   And I think while he waited, he was crying out.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.400]   All those I O U S, all those came from the Psalms.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.360]   So I get help by looking at David in the pit, and I get help from all the prayers that the
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.680]   Psalms made, and I get mainly help from keeping my face in the book and pleading with God
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.560]   to reveal himself to me over and over.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.760]   And I know you don't ask these questions, Tony, in order to get me to advertise books,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.960]   but I just got to say, C.J. Mahaney told me his favorite Piper book is "When I Don't Desire
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.360]   God," and I think that's because C.J. loves application.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.040]   He loves nitty-gritty, down-to-earth, in-your-face, helpful counsel.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.240]   And that's my most practical book out of all the dozens of books I've done.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.520]   If somebody's asking, "I don't desire God, and I've been in a season of not desiring
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   God for months.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   What can I do?"
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:25.880]   Well, there's five minutes worth, but if you want ten hours worth, I did my dead-devil
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.320]   best to get down real in that book and say it.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.360]   And I noticed, too, that there are three messages that Desiring God calls "How to Fight for
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   Joy," these conference messages.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.040]   I don't even know where I gave them, but if you typed in "How to Fight for Joy," they're
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   there.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.480]   You can find those 2005 regional conference messages by searching for "How to Fight for
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.120]   Joy," sessions one, two, and three, and you will also find a questions and answers session.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.400]   Those and thousands of other free resources from John Piper can be found online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   I'm your host, Tony Arenke.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.200]   Thanks for listening.
