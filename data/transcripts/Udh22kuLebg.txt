[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The following is a conversation with Roger Reeves, one of the most prolific drug smugglers
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   in history.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.440]   He worked for Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa, the leaders behind the Medellin Cartel.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.120]   Roger was the employer and close friend of Barry Seal, the infamous drug smuggler who
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.040]   was the main character in the movie American Maid.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.180]   Roger transported countless tons of cocaine and marijuana, covering six continents.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.820]   He escaped prison five times, was shut down in both Mexico and Colombia, and was tortured
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.040]   nearly to death in a Mexican prison.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.400]   Through all of this, his wife Mari, the love of his life, was there with him, and when
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.320]   he was in prison, she waited for him.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.800]   He recently got out of prison, where for many years he worked on his memoir called Smuggler.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   This podcast is an exploration of his story.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.920]   Quick mention of our sponsors, Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN, Four Sigmatic, and Aidsleep.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.360]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.040]   Let me say a few words about Roger Reeves, Pablo Escobar, and the war on drugs.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.400]   This conversation with Roger is unlike any I've ever done.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.760]   In the eyes of many, including the law, Roger is a criminal, a bad man who has added to
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.680]   the suffering of the world.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.000]   But he never directly engaged or participated in the violence, unlike his bosses, Pablo
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.380]   Escobar and Jorge Ochoa.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.080]   His crime was the transport of drugs.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.200]   I thought about this, and about Pablo Escobar, who was at once both a brutal murderer and
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.280]   a Robin Hood figure who helped the poor and was loved by thousands, if not millions.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.320]   We sometimes idolize murderers and destroy good, honest men.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.400]   We give power and money to corrupt politicians and dictators that starve and murder their
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.080]   own people.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.600]   Given this, I think about what makes for a good man, and what makes for a bad man, and
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.560]   who decides.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.920]   Sitting across from Roger, I saw a complicated man, but one who has kindness in his heart,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.680]   a love for money and adventure, and a disdain for violence.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   Again, his crime was the transport of drugs.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.440]   Since 1971, the war on drugs has cost US $1 trillion.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.280]   Marijuana legalization alone would save and make $13.7 billion.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.520]   That could send more than 650,000 students to public universities every year.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.480]   Then there's the human stories of the 500,000 human beings sitting in prison for drug-related
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.940]   offenses and the 1.1 million on probation and parole.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.520]   Their life is damaged or ruined beyond repair due to the prohibition of drugs.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   There's a lot more to be said about the damage done by the war on drugs, but when reading
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   about Roger's story and talking to him, I couldn't escape the thought that while society
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.440]   wants to label him a criminal and a bad human being, there are much worse men out there
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.720]   who we give a pass to, even give power to, even men who hold political office or run
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   companies.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.160]   I also think about my role as an interviewer, sitting across a man like Roger.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.000]   In these interviews, in life, in many ways I continue to be myself, a person who like
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   Dostoevsky's The Idiot, seeks the good in all people, but is hurt by it on occasion
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.680]   and maybe is destroyed by it in the end.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   I'm not naive, but I'm also optimistic and have hope for humanity.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.640]   That's who I am, and that's what these conversations are.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.320]   I hope you join me and I hope you understand that I come from a place of love.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation with Roger Reeves.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.120]   You are one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.920]   What would you say motivated you?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.720]   Money, power, the thrill, or was it something else?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   Money.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.680]   But isn't there a point where you've had more money than you can possibly know what to do
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   with?
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.080]   Or was it always more money?
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.240]   You know, I had plenty of money several times.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.360]   And I think it's sort of like if you was in Las Vegas and you had the slot machine handled
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.520]   down and the gold coins was tumbling around you and you had sweepers bagging them up,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.480]   when would you let it go?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.680]   But isn't some part of that the thrill then?
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.280]   Oh, there was a lot of thrill, sometimes way too much.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.240]   You made certainly tens of millions of dollars, probably much more.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.800]   What memorable experience did having that much money make possible for you?
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.400]   So there's one thing is the money, and the other thing is what that money can buy.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.200]   Well, I bought everything that I could hide.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.160]   I bought seven farms.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.840]   I owned the land where the city of Merino Valley, California is.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.280]   I had an option on that land.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.480]   Did the planning and development of that.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.880]   The most expensive coin in the world.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.560]   Yachts, ships, airplanes galore.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.000]   That bring you happiness?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.960]   No, absolutely not.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.280]   In fact, I think I'm happier now.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.920]   I know I'm happier now.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.840]   So looking back, would you do it the same way all again?
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.320]   No way.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.400]   Really?
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.760]   Even the thrill of it?
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   Not even the thrill of it.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.000]   It wasn't worth 33 years in prison, being away from my lovely family.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.120]   So money, what about the power?
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:46.640]   Just being on top of the world where nobody can, not the governments, the police, all
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.440]   the big bad agencies chasing you.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.800]   You could do whatever the heck you wanted.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.440]   As far as having to look over your shoulder everywhere you went, every phone call you
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.040]   made, make sure that you was naked with somebody in the ocean before you talked.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.840]   It's rather uncomfortable.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.120]   I like to make phone calls the same way.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.880]   What was it like meeting and working with Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.440]   cartel?
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.400]   He just seemed like a gentleman when I met him.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.160]   He's just like you and I sitting here, shook hands.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.640]   I had flown one load for a fellow, and it didn't work out well.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.200]   The fellow that I gave it to got shot, and it took a while to get my money in.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.120]   They didn't put as many kilos on the plane as they're supposed to, and so I wasn't
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.360]   going to work with them anymore.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.400]   My contact down there introduced me to Jorge Ochoa.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.320]   We went up in Envigada.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.120]   We went up, and the gate opened, and we was escorted in.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.760]   There must have been 50 men out in the yards, a hitching rail on an old house.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.040]   We was escorted right in, and there was a beautiful woman in there.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.240]   I mean gorgeous, drop-dead beautiful.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.160]   She made us a cup of coffee and then was ushered in to see Jorge Ochoa.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.040]   He had 12 telephones on his desk, and all of them was a different color.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   He shook hands.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.560]   He was very friendly, spoke English.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.400]   He said that each one of those telephones represented another city in the United States.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   This is Chicago, and this is New York.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.080]   If I ring, I knew who was calling.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.040]   We chatted a while, and he asked me what type of airplanes I had and what experience I had
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.600]   flying across the U.S. border.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   I told him he seemed pleased with it.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.280]   He called the lady in, and she went next door.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.040]   In came Pablo Escobar, and he introduced me to Pablo Escobar.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.520]   He asked the same questions again, and I answered them.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.480]   I asked him how much he paid, and he paid $5,000 a kilo to haul it.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.600]   I said, "How much you put on the plane?"
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.280]   He said, "300, 500."
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.160]   I said, "That's one and a half, two and a half million dollars for an eight-hour trip."
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.680]   It sounded pretty good to me.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.560]   We're talking about cocaine, and we're talking about Colombia.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.880]   Colombia and cocaine and Medellín Cartel.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.200]   Jorge Ochoa was one of the, what would you say, founding members of the Medellín?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.280]   He was probably the brains behind the whole thing.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.040]   The brains and spoke good English.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.360]   There were nice people.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   Really nice people.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   Were you scared?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.920]   Not at all.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.680]   What's wrong with your mind that you weren't scared?
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.880]   Here's some of the most dangerous men in this world, and you weren't scared?
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.160]   I knew I was going to do exactly what I said I was going to do.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.480]   Mario and the children were down there.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.160]   They went down, and they stayed in the hotel, five-star, treated royally on my first load.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.560]   They just did it as security to make sure that I wasn't a DEA agent.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.240]   I did the first load, and they can say they were hostages, but they really weren't.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.320]   It was just insurance.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.360]   There was some integrity to the way they operated.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   Completely.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.240]   I mean, straight up.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:08.000]   The money was ironed and banded, and just right, and the numbers were never once anything
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   wrong with it.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   What would you attribute that honesty to?
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.960]   In their own moral system, in their own set of rules, why weren't people crossing the
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:27.120]   line and shaving off the top and injecting chaos into the system to where it would be
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.960]   unpredictable and people would be dishonest and greedy and all those kinds of things?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   That's true.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.920]   Most people are, but there's certain people at the top of the food chain that they don't
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.280]   need that.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.560]   If they're completely honest, then they don't have to think of, remember the lie they told.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.920]   Plus, they're just honest to start with.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   They're making plenty of money.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.560]   They was making as much money as I did.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.640]   I'll tell you how that came about.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.920]   I understand that 10,000 people were killed every year in Medellín, Colombia.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   What they were doing, they didn't have any organization.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.960]   If one fellow had 10 kilos and he wanted it shipped to New York, he would tell his friend.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.640]   His friend says, "Sure, I'll ship it.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.560]   I have a pilot and I'll ship it up."
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.120]   Then he would look in the newspapers, "Oh, 40 kilos was busted in New Jersey.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.480]   I'm so sorry.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   Yours got busted."
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.280]   Bang, bang, he's dead.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:29.240]   Here comes Jorge Ochoa and the three Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar and Gacho.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.600]   They decided that we would make an insurance company, that we would charge you $10,000
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.080]   to take it to your contact in Miami.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.680]   If it gets lost anywhere between the time I put it on the airplane or the time you give
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.600]   it to us and the time we give it to your man, we will replace it in Colombia for you.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.760]   There was no way anybody could lose.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.040]   I understand they got 100 tons piled up under that insurance program.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.080]   I was right there the first day.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.320]   I had all the work I could do.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   I would land and I'd say, "When do you want me to come back?
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.480]   We're waiting on you, senor."
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.640]   Let me ask a difficult question.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.720]   Some see Escobar as a brutal murderer and some see him as maybe a Robin Hood-like figure
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.640]   who helped the poor.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.040]   How do you see the man?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.320]   Both of them.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.240]   I think he started out, to be honest, with helping the poor and then they had a war down
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.920]   there and they blew up and killed his people.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   The country was divided almost equally three ways.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.080]   They had the military.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.480]   They were just as much into it as anybody.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.600]   Then you had the FARC guerrillas.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.840]   They had about a third of the country.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   Then you had the conchers.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.880]   It was like the white farmers.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.080]   They're the ones that I was dealing with and they were at war with one another.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.520]   If one of them started killing their people, I'll kill some of yours too.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.520]   That's how it happened.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.040]   Then when I heard about Pablo Escobar blowing up that airliner and killing those women and
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.560]   children, I was sorry I ever shook his hand.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   That's brutal murder.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.880]   You would say Escobar is not a good man.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880]   Not at all.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   He was terrible.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.040]   Now, looking back on it, when I met him, he was good.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.680]   Did just exactly what he said he would do.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.400]   Would he be a bad man and a man you can trust?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.360]   Absolutely, you could trust him, yes.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.800]   From your perspective in terms of business, he was reliable.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.680]   He was honest, had integrity.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.080]   You could work with him and he felt safe.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   Completely.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.600]   We flew up to his ranch and we brought out motorcycles to start with.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   Can you ride a motorcycle?
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.560]   Of course I can ride a motorcycle.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.000]   I took off across the grass and there was a little ditch there.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.480]   The front wheel dropped in that thing and I must have slid across that grass 20 feet
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   before I got stopped.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.160]   He almost fell off his bike waiting because they knew what it was going to do.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.840]   Then we got on horses and went out there and pretended to round up some cows.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.440]   He put a Mac-10 machine gun pistol over my shoulder.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.840]   Do you know how to use this?
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.040]   Well, I never had, but it was all right.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.960]   I think it was like, "Okay, you got 10 bodyguards.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.200]   What do you need me for?"
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.040]   That's the kind of time we laughed and talked and drove some cows over the stumps.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.440]   You said Jorge Ochoa was perhaps the brains of the Medellin cartel.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.320]   What was he like and why do you say he was the brains?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.520]   He was a gentleman.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:43.080]   I suppose he shipped, no telling how many more times of cocaine than Pablo did.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.560]   Him and his brothers, you could tell by the, they had on each load, they was in duffel
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:56.480]   bags and it was big football shaped, fluffy stuff made with ether.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.160]   They would have three horns on it or a rattlesnake or four X's on each bag.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.320]   You kind of got to knowing which was which and they shipped a lot.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   He was just a gentleman.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:17.480]   I took the family, we went one weekend to his ranch or his palacio place out near Barranquilla
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.560]   and oh, he just treated the family.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:29.400]   His family had, his younger brother made a bullfight and we had skiing and little airplanes
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.040]   on floats on the water.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.440]   It was really nice and he was really nice.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:42.800]   How do you make sense of the tension that a man could be a gentleman, could have integrity
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.880]   but also be a murderer?
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.200]   Well murder is a stronger word than killing.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.480]   Can you explain the line, the gray area we're talking about?
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.320]   I mean I've just talking with Jocko Willink and we talked a lot about killing in the context
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.600]   of military conflict and the context of war.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.200]   So there, there's a line between murder and killing that you can draw.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.080]   What's the line that you're referring to?
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.640]   It's something similar.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:19.320]   If people are shooting at you and you shoot back and kill him, that's not murder whatsoever.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.440]   He's trying to get away or out of the situation.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:29.480]   But if some woman don't pay you and you send a hit man over to kill her and her children,
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.480]   that's murder.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   That's murder.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.280]   Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things?
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   I don't think so at all.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.520]   I mean he was just such a gentleman.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.880]   He had a restaurant before and he was just smart.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.120]   I understand that the first 10 kilos he sold, he was sitting on a motorcycle in the sidelines
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.600]   in a parking lot and when the DEA come in, he sped away.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.320]   So he didn't come back to America.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   He was just smart.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.040]   Some people just are savvy.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.800]   He was such a gentleman and the whole family, the mother and the father, the two brothers,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.760]   their sister, I was there when she was kidnapped.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:10.800]   Finally, he kidnapped I guess 100 liters of the fork and said, "All right, if she don't
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.440]   come back, none of these are going to come back."
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.520]   So they made a deal.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.240]   Is there something you can say about the power structure, the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.000]   that you interacted with?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.160]   Was it a dictatorship where Pablo ran everything?
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.680]   Was there a bunch of power centers?
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.960]   Was it like a company where you have CEO, CTO kind of thing and then there's like managers
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.360]   and all those kinds of things?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   How did it run from a leadership perspective?
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   I understand that about five of them got together and made this, I would call it an insurance
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.640]   company, now known as the Medellin cartel.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.800]   I didn't see any difference.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:59.280]   Each one of them had their own business and their people from the jungle or wherever made
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.440]   the cocaine gave it to them and they shipped it.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.740]   So it didn't seem to be any power play between them at all.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:14.160]   But my main contact was Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar was right there and I saw plenty of
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.600]   stuff for him too.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.760]   It's strange that they didn't betray each other regularly.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.280]   You know, greed makes men betray each other.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.560]   How do you explain that?
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.320]   How much betrayal did you see?
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.120]   I didn't see any.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.200]   Absolutely none.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   If they shipped his hundred kilos, he got paid for it.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.040]   If the other one shipped his, I'm sure they got paid for it.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   How do you explain that?
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.520]   Well, there was no need to.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.720]   The money was just unbelievable.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:53.920]   You think about 500 kilos in the plane at $50,000 a kilo at the time.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.560]   And they paid $5,000 to ship it.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.600]   And they made 5,000 without even touching it.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.880]   They just had somebody to load it on through the airplane.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.720]   I gave it to their man in Miami.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:11.040]   They gave it to whoever it belonged to by the marks on the duffel bags.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.600]   So they was making just untold millions.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.920]   Just no reason.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.160]   But greed can blind men.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.960]   It's still strange to me that there was not more betrayal.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   It speaks to something else perhaps that's bigger than money.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.360]   Maybe not.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:41.020]   But it seems like just like in the casino, like you mentioned, we get accustomed to whatever
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.760]   level of money we have, we get accustomed very quickly.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.280]   And then there's a tension that's natural between human beings.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.640]   And when that tension combined with money, combined with power, combined with, like you
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:03.760]   mentioned, beautiful women and a bit of violence, it seems that betrayal should be commonplace.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.460]   But it's not.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.460]   It wasn't.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460]   Not at all.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.920]   A couple of years later, I don't know if he betrayed anybody, but he started that.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.720]   He was running cocaine through the Bahamas.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.160]   And he had the island.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160]   I didn't go.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   I was offered to fly with a DC-3 with that, but I didn't like it.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.200]   So I had my route through the oil wells in Louisiana.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.760]   And so I didn't want to change.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.320]   But he talked a lot.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.040]   And I don't know if he betrayed, but they didn't like him.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:36.080]   So as you expand, there could be tensions that lead to conflict.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.580]   Louisiana was, like you said, an ultra-violent place.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.060]   How did you survive?
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.420]   Who protected you?
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.940]   I was a hero.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.940]   They liked me.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.580]   I mean, I was just treated royally.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.740]   All I did, I would come over El Banco.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.940]   There's a radio station at the forks of the Magdalena River.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.260]   I believe it was 720, if I remember right, on the AM.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.580]   And I'd fly in at 10,000 feet, and I'd see below me there'd be a Cessna.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.140]   And I'd wiggle my wings, and he'd wiggle his, and I'd fall in behind him, and we might go
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.140]   100, 200 miles.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:12.060]   And I'd land on some jungle strip or some banana plantation.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.420]   And they'd fuel me up.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.020]   I could eat steak.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.660]   In the night, it was just like treated royally.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.020]   And I mean, take off the next morning, whenever I wanted to.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.060]   It was just like that was protected.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.100]   And I was an honored guest.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.780]   It wasn't anything like in that movie, putting a gun to your head and taking your sunglasses
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.780]   and betting.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.740]   One time I complained to Jorge Ochoa that the runway was pretty short that they were
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.740]   using.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.020]   And I went back down there, and it looked like Los Angeles International.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.380]   They had bulldozers in there.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.980]   They had that thing 5,000 feet long.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.540]   Just like, just the next week, it was all done.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.560]   The jungle was gone, and clay put up there.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.340]   And all the while, you were not afraid.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.860]   You were treated like a royalty.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.420]   Yes, there I was.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.860]   I was afraid when I landed in the United States.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.740]   So maybe let's go back to the beginning.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   What was the first time you flew an airplane with drugs on it?
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.860]   Tell me the story of the first time you smuggled drugs.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.860]   All right.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:16.540]   I flew down to Jalapa Vera cruise with a Cessna 182.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.700]   And we landed at the town.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.700]   It was a lovely town.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.980]   It was just an old town, looked like Bible times.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.620]   Women were washing their clothes in the streets with stone basins and the stream running through.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.780]   I just was just dumbstruck.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.780]   It was just so pretty.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.500]   And I went in a church, in a Catholic church, and it had the Stations of the Cross all carved
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   magnificent.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.220]   I'd never seen that.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.820]   And I come home and told Marie about that.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.660]   That just almost brought tears to my eyes.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.140]   It was so beautiful.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.500]   And three o'clock the next morning, I went out to the airport and taxied down to the
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.340]   taxiway, and there was a guard came out and wanted to know what I was doing.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.340]   And I pulled out.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.580]   I was on the fire department out in Redondo Beach, California.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.220]   So I pulled out my wallet, and it was the fire department badge.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.980]   And oh, he shook my hand and was so glad.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.780]   So I taxied on down there, and we loaded up about 400 pounds in the plane.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.220]   And I came on back, and I was running the headwinds more than I thought.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.660]   And I landed on a little strip.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.580]   You're talking about on the way back?
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.100]   On the way back, on the way north after we loaded up early in the morning.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.660]   And that's the only time I ever got vertigo.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.340]   The mountains were coming down at a 30 or 40 degree angle, and the Milky Way was overhead.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.820]   And somehow I wanted that airplane to be level with the stars.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.820]   And it got me.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.220]   And it's a phenomenal pile of vertigo.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.860]   It's the only time I ever had it was on that load.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.060]   So anyway, the wind was on the nose of that system.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.540]   I wasn't going to make it to the dry lake where I had fuel.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.380]   So I landed on a little bitty strip, and there was a little house.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.980]   It was caved in, and it was a little boy named Lazarus, about six or seven years old.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.800]   And he was herding some goats.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.680]   So we put the marijuana in that house, and the man stayed with it while I flew into some
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.900]   town and got fuel and came back.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.100]   We sat down with the lunch that I brought back, and little Lazarus sat there and ate
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   with us.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.100]   And we had a good time.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.100]   We loaded on back and came home.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.100]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.100]   I wonder where he is now.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.100]   He is.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.500]   So what was it like to fly?
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.700]   Maybe describe the details of do you have to fly low?
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:23.820]   Is there details that are unique to this experience of flying an airplane with drugs on it, on
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.820]   board?
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.820]   All right.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.020]   Well, one of the mistakes that just thousands, hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pilots
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.500]   make, they don't stop at the border going down and get their permit.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.820]   Once you get a permit to be in Mexico, you've got it for six months.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.100]   You can go anywhere, any fishing village, any little town, any little place, show them
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   this and you're welcome.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.500]   If you don't have that, you go straight to jail.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.140]   So you go down there and you think, "Okay, they're going to have fuel for me to come
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.140]   back and so forth."
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.140]   Oh, sorry, senor.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.580]   That had a rusty leak in it.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.580]   We don't have any.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.300]   Well, you better be able to go to town and get it.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.940]   So that's what I did.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:06.620]   And when I was coming back for several years, I would fly up at Mexicali and cross the border
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.220]   right at Calexico.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.540]   I would act like I was landing on the Calexico side just after dark.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.380]   And then I'd zip across the border and go over to the Salton Sea and go below sea level
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.020]   a hundred and something feet, I believe 170 feet, and come on up and go out there above
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.500]   Palm Springs and land out in 29 Palms in the desert and put my stuff under a Joshua tree
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.940]   and fly into town and get my pickup and go on back out and get it.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.460]   And that was fun.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.820]   And then it got really dangerous.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.140]   They had Operation Starlight, I believe was the name of it.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.500]   And they caught a lot of pilots coming across the border.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   So I changed it.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.100]   And by that time, I was flying bigger planes.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.900]   I was flying Beach 18s.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.700]   And I would refuel in Mulaje halfway down on Baja Peninsula.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.740]   And then over in the middle, 20 miles from the nearest road was a goat ranch where they
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.700]   milk goats and made cheese.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.140]   And I would go there and unload the load coming up out of anywhere in southern Mexico.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:09.700]   And I would land there and a guy named Juan would put the marijuana under the trees and
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.940]   I'd fly into Mulaje and they'd wash my plane and gas it up.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.540]   And I'd eat lunch and rent a room for a few hours and take a nap and a shower and then
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.780]   go back in the afternoon and fill up.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.620]   And then I would go northwest out of there and fly 200 miles off the coast of the island
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.120]   of Guadalupe.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.860]   And from there, I would fly on a more northwestern heading about 300 miles out over the Pacific.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.500]   And then I would come in behind the Santa Barbara Islands down low and then I'd come
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.180]   up and go out in the desert land.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.260]   And I did that for the rest of the marijuana trips.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:49.100]   What was the hardest part about flying those routes?
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.300]   The hardest part was getting good marijuana.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.540]   So the hardest part isn't the flying?
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.540]   No, it's the flying.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.180]   It's just like driving your car down.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.500]   But then I had people that would bring me on trips that were just unworthy of an airplane.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.020]   When I'd land on a highway.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:11.060]   And in the rainy season, I would come back to land again and the guy wouldn't think about
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.460]   it and he'd have like little heels on both sides and the wings were out there.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.780]   The grass and the weeds would grow up and it sounded like tearing the airplane apart
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.300]   when those wings hit, mowing the grass down both shoulders of the airplane.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.540]   The weeds would grow up high in the tropics.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.220]   So some of that stuff was bad.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:35.300]   Oh, getting bad gasoline and telling me that land here in the light and knock the wheels
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.580]   off when you land.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.380]   Oh, you should have landed a little further up here, senor, they ditched down.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.380]   That sort of thing.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.980]   What was it like landing on a highway?
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.940]   And when did you have to land on the highway?
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.200]   I landed on the highway most of my life, most of the times.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.700]   In Mexico, first time I went down, there was a place called Pichulingui.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:02.180]   It had a 900 foot strip and I would fly down and I'd carry gasoline with me and Mari and
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.300]   I would go to the grocery store and buy all kinds of little goodies and candies and toys
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.620]   to bring to the children.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:15.900]   And that sand strip in the bend of a river was just too short to take off of the load.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.260]   So there was a young man there named Pedro, must have weighed much over 100, maybe 120
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.260]   pounds.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.100]   And he'd get in a plane with me.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.260]   And he'd direct me 20, 30, 40 miles away to a highway.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.740]   And the people walking and the people would pull out in a two ton truck with a machine
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.180]   gun on it and a bunch of guys with arms and they'd block the road.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.860]   And then another one would block it up about a mile away and I'd land right over that truck.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.540]   And they'd load me up and it looked like a bucket brigade with the marijuana coming.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.900]   I'd shake hands with all of them.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.380]   And I'd take off right over the other trucks.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.340]   And sometimes maybe 20, 30, 40 cars lined up.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.500]   One time I remember a patrol car, a highway patrol car.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   He didn't have his lights on.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.180]   I took off right over him.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.940]   And then when I started flying to Louisiana, the bridge over the Mississippi River, there
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.000]   were several contractors that went broke.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.580]   And that thing was out for years.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:13.120]   And about five miles from the river was flashing red lights and a detour.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.340]   And then the swamp on both sides of it and the middle of it was growing up with 20 feet
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.460]   trees.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.780]   And that was like an international runway from anywhere in the world.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.500]   So I landed on that and over and over those red lights, just like the end of a runway.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.140]   And then the next morning we'd go out there and scrub the marks off the highway where
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.300]   I'd landed before daylight.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.740]   Wow.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:42.940]   Let's go to somebody you've known well, somebody who's also a drug smuggler is Barry Seal.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.800]   Who is Barry Seal?
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   How did you meet him?
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.380]   Barry Seal is a friend of mine.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:57.100]   Mari and I and the children went down in Honduras and we went up Lake Azul, I believe it was,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.740]   and we were looking at a ranch to buy.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.660]   I was looking for something in Central America where I'd have a halfway place.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.220]   Oh, it was lovely.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.860]   We stayed up there for some days and our clothes got muddy and we went in the river and all
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860]   kind of thing.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.020]   So we got to San Pedro Sula and we was going back to New Orleans.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:19.820]   So we went to the cleaners to get our clothes and most all of them was in there.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.340]   And they go, "Oh, senor, they'll be ready tomorrow morning.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.340]   We're not ready now."
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.600]   Well, the plane leaves at nine o'clock or whatever.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.540]   So I told Mari for her and the children to go into the airport because it'd be easier
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.400]   for one on a standby flight.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:41.300]   So I went to the laundromat for the clothes and they were ready and there was a pile of
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   them.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.660]   So I went and got in a taxi and the old taxi was driving with it and I'd give him $100
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:52.020]   to go faster and he just blew his horn more rapid.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.340]   We got to the airport and I jumped out and ran around on the tarmac and here's a brand
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.100]   new 727 taxiing out.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.340]   Oh, no.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.060]   So I'm waving to the pilot and he's a young fellow.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.900]   He waves back.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.900]   Then I see Mari's face in the cockpit and the nose goes down where he puts on brakes
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.660]   and he laughs and he puts some stairwell out.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.100]   And I run for the stairwell and he pulls it back up and goes like a hitchhiker going to
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.980]   pick you up and go again.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.980]   Then he put it out and I got on and the whole crowd clapped and I'm coming home with that
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.980]   load of clothes.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:31.300]   So I go way down in the middle and the plane's full and Mari, my daughter, is about nine
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.940]   years old then.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.580]   And she was sitting in the middle and by the window was Barry Seal.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.940]   Of course, I didn't know it.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:42.300]   I sat in the middle and we took off and the wheels come up with clunk.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.460]   Then I got up about 5,000 feet and we had a little clunk.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.460]   And she said, "What was that, Daddy?"
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.340]   I said, "He just turned on his autopilot."
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.980]   That fellow reached over and I looked at him.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.020]   I said, "He looks like CIA or FBI, something.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.660]   He ain't supposed to be here."
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.500]   Clear blue eyes, gentleman looking man.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.900]   And he said, "You fly these things?"
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.300]   I said, "I got a few hours, mister."
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.900]   He said, "I'll fly them too or something."
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.260]   He said, "My name's Barry Seal."
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.580]   He reached over near him and shook hands.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:13.620]   And we got to talking and I thought, "There's no choice or seats on this.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.660]   It's just open seating, but I don't believe him one bit."
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.380]   And he started talking about he just got out of jail that morning, just got out of prison.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.780]   And I said, "Uh-huh."
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:31.460]   And he told me that he'd been a pilot with the TWA and this and other.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.940]   And he told me what he was for.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.220]   So we had a nice conversation for a couple of hours in New Orleans.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.300]   I didn't believe him.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:44.180]   So he got off in front of us and what a crowd of people to meet him.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.700]   An old mother and a wife and little children hanging on to him, crying and hugging and
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.700]   kissing him.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.580]   I said, "He was telling the truth."
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.100]   So I reached over and gave him a little piece of paper.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.860]   I had him already write it out with our address.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.580]   I said, "Barry, I might have some work for you."
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.540]   What was he in jail for?
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.980]   He got caught with 100 kilos of cocaine in a small plane.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.940]   And so he served a year.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.020]   And that was from Colombia?
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.220]   I don't know where it come from.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.340]   He got caught in Honduras, probably refueling.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:21.580]   But he'd been in prison down there before for bringing explosives to the Cuban Contras.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.740]   And he lost his job with the airlines.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:29.420]   And then later on, I found out he was ex-CIA and George Bush Sr.'s protege and had a thousand
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.460]   parachute jumps and was there.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.020]   He was a hot shot, Bob.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.540]   There's a million questions I want to ask here.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.340]   But maybe can we linger on it a little bit longer?
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.500]   What was your relationship with him like?
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.180]   You were a drug smuggler.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.500]   He's a drug smuggler.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.700]   Your friends, how often do you guys talk?
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.660]   How often do you work together?
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.820]   What was the relationship like?
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.460]   Well, I'll back up and just finish where I started off there.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.620]   I gave him the things, "Barry, I may have some work for you.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.540]   I know I got some work for you."
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.780]   And I said, "Come out to Santa Barbara."
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.860]   And so, I don't know, a week or two later, he flew out and went to our house and stayed
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.460]   with us a couple of days.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.580]   And I had an almost brand new Aero Commander 690B.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.220]   That thing was a turboprop, and it was hot.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.740]   It was the hottest thing I'd ever had.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.060]   So I said, "Let's go, Barry.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.460]   Let's see what you can do."
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.020]   And he said, "I'm sorry I said that.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.300]   We got about 10,000 feet."
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   And he was like one of them Blue Angel pilots.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.700]   He wrung that thing out.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.060]   And I said, "That's enough."
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.260]   And then he did a falling leaf.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.180]   That's where you cut the engines and the plane falls from side to side.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.860]   And I saw Bob Hoover do that in an air show once, and that's the only person I ever saw
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.860]   do it.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.420]   And my hand was white knuckle hanging onto the seat.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.420]   You shut off the engine?
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.700]   Yeah, he shut off the engines and landed flying side by side like this.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.980]   How do you explain that?
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.540]   Was he just a wild man, or was he sufficiently skilled to wear it?
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.100]   He was sufficiently skilled.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   Absolutely.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.060]   He knew what he was doing.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.220]   I can get a plane from one spot to another, and I guess I'm known as a good pilot.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:13.140]   But that guy, it was aerobatic.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.940]   So anyway, he stayed with us a couple of days, and then I told him, I said, "This plane needs
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.940]   tanking."
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.180]   I said, "I got some work down in Columbia.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.020]   It needs to come back to Louisiana, and I need 2,500-mile range."
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.660]   He said, "I got somebody in Arkansas to do that and keep the mouth shut."
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.820]   So I gave him $10,000, and he flew away.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.780]   And in a few days, he called me and said, "Come to my house in Baton Rouge."
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.580]   So I went out to his house in Baton Rouge, and I stayed with him for a few days.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.540]   And that plane was tanked, I mean, beautiful from stem to stern.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   I could went from Bolivia to Canada with it.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.740]   So then I hired him to fly, and he was funny.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.420]   I paid him $1 million a trip.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.940]   I paid him $2,000 a kilo, so about a million-dollar trip.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.700]   And I didn't get paid until the people received it.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.100]   They had to ship it to Chicago and New York, and then the money come back.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.020]   So it was a couple of two or three-week pipeline.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.780]   Well I always had to pay him before he'd go again.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.780]   And he'd bellyache.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.580]   I mean, he'd moan and groan.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:21.700]   So one time I gave him $1 million, and I put it in a box real nice.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.020]   So how big is a box that contains a million dollars?
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.020]   So we're talking about $100 bills?
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.020]   $100.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.020]   It's not very big.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.580]   You can put it in a large briefcase.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.500]   It weighs exactly 10 kilos.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.740]   Each bill weighs a gram, so you can weigh your money and almost get it exactly right.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.020]   20-something pounds is a million dollars.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.020]   22 pounds.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.020]   22 pounds.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.020]   $100 bills.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:48.180]   But in $1 bills, it's one ton, 2,200 pounds.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.580]   We didn't even accept them.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.460]   Were you the one that introduced Barry Seale to Pablo Escobar?
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.540]   No.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.340]   I didn't introduce him at all.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.260]   And our deal was that you don't meet my people.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.620]   I mean, we just kind of crossed you working for me to fly the airplanes.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:09.260]   So he wanted these Panther conversions, cost $400,000 each, with a storm scope and radar.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.500]   So I bought anything he wanted.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.060]   What's that mean, sorry to interrupt?
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.660]   Panther conversions?
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.380]   Panther conversion was these people called Panther.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.740]   They took everything out from the firewall, the instruments and all, and converted them
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:27.100]   and put Q-tip propellers on them, full-bladed, and very quiet.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.940]   And the CIA developed those in Southeast Asia for running behind the lines.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.180]   And that's where Barry had flown those things, so he knew about them.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.380]   So that's what he wanted, and that's what we got him.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.060]   How does that connect to Pablo?
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.780]   And so he worked for you, and you got those upgrades.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.220]   I think he flew about 30 loads for me, and then I got arrested for everything in the
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   world.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.180]   I got 35 years sentence.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.700]   But let me back up a little bit.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.380]   Barry was our friend, Mari and I, both friend.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:05.060]   We should pause real quick and say Mari is your wife, and hopefully she'll convince her
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.060]   to join us in a little bit.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.940]   She's the love of your life, and she weaves in and out of many of these stories that you
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.940]   tell.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.380]   Yes, she was there.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:19.060]   She was behind the scenes, but I kept her out of it completely.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.180]   And then also you mentioned Mariam as your daughter.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.180]   Yes.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:28.500]   Our son was a baby, and I remember we went out to La Festival, was my favorite restaurant
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.500]   in Carl Gables.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.700]   Oh, God, it was good.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.900]   And Barry knew about it.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:38.260]   Anyhow, we went out to dinner, and so we came back and there was no rooms.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.540]   So Barry, well, spend the night with us.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:45.900]   So he goes to our hotel room with us, and we got two big beds in the Omni Hotel.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.500]   And he lays over there and gets down to his striped undershorts and his T-shirt, and he
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.380]   puts the baby up on his belly and gives him the bottle and says, "Mm, ain't that good,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.380]   Red?
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.380]   Oh, my, my."
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.380]   And he just feeds the baby.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.380]   We laugh and talk.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.420]   And that's how close we were that we could all stay in a hotel room together.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.020]   And would you say he's a good man?
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.420]   A wonderful man.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.340]   A gentleman, southern gentleman.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.300]   He's looked after his mother, his family, everybody around him.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   Everybody loved Barry.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.340]   He just had a little smile on his face always.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.700]   So you got arrested, and then what happened to Barry?
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.900]   Well, Barry knew the people that unloaded, of course.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.460]   He sent the cars down and all that.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:35.340]   So he met the unloader, a guy named Lito, Luis Carlos Bustamante, a Venezuelan.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.660]   So he just kept on flying.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:42.660]   But he, I believe, had three of my airplanes at $400,000 a piece, and they owed me some
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.660]   money.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.260]   Well, he collected a lot of that and gave Mari the money and put it in his safe and
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.540]   took her to his house and all after I got arrested, sent a lawyer in.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.540]   He got me the best lawyer in the country, Albert Krieger.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.180]   He was head of the defense team for all of America.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.060]   Wonderful man.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:06.980]   Can you tell the story of the months that led up to Barry's assassination?
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.980]   What did you know?
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   What did you sense?
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:09.980]   What did you think?
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.980]   Okay.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.820]   When I got out of prison, I hadn't been out long, I was eating breakfast, and there was
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.500]   Ronald Reagan's face right in the television.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.620]   We have absolute proof that the communist Sandinista government is in the cocaine running
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.900]   business.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:31.980]   And there was that fat lady, the C-126, on the runway with the belly in, and I thought,
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.780]   "Oh, God, he had done it."
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.700]   I had heard that Barry might have been working with him.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.700]   So it wasn't long before-
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   Working with-
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:46.420]   With the DEA or whoever, he was no longer on our side.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:51.980]   Can you clarify how you got that from the Reagan making a statement about, "We've heard-"?
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.100]   Okay, there was his plane.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.420]   There was Barry's plane.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:01.620]   On the way north, we could stop in Nicaraguan land on a military base or on a base that
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.380]   they used as crop dusters and all, and refuel.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.700]   And so that shortened our trip, we go further into the jungle and come up, and that was
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.060]   what Pablo Escobar and Ochoa and them, and they had to- they was associates with the
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.660]   people in Nicaragua.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:22.820]   So Barry was- if that plane was there, that means Barry was feeding the DEA information.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.520]   He was working with them at that time.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.380]   But let me back up a little bit.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:32.140]   When I was flying, and I told Barry we would refuel in a train's airplane, the loads in
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.300]   Belize where I had a spot up there.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:42.700]   And then that's when they told me we can refuel in Nicaragua, and then you fly all the way,
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.580]   and Barry couldn't believe it.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.100]   He says, "All right, but I wanted to land.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:51.580]   I had a place in Louisiana for $10,000 that I could unload, and the sheriff and all of
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.300]   them was paid off."
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.260]   And he said, "No, no, no.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.180]   I can't get caught in Mena, Arkansas."
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.060]   I said, "What do you mean you can't get caught in Mena, Arkansas?
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   You get caught anywhere."
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.860]   He said, "I can't, but it's going to cost you $50,000 every time my wheels touch the
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   ground."
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:13.140]   Why- can you explain why he can't get caught in Mena, Arkansas?
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.020]   He said he was hooked up with them at the very top, and he even said, "I'm going to
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.940]   have dinner with the governor tonight."
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   That's- at that time-
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.940]   So Mena, Arkansas-
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   Mr. Bill Clinton.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.940]   Undoubtedly.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.860]   And it's like, "Did Bill Clinton- did you give him any money?"
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.500]   And I said, "No, I never gave the man any money."
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.980]   But it was like the money that I had that went to Grand Cayman Islands.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   And I told my lawyer, I said, "I never touched that money."
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.060]   He said, "You don't have to fondle it to be guilty."
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   So-
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:45.220]   So what- I mean, there's a lot of conspiracy theories around the relationship between Barry
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.900]   Seale and the Clintons.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:47.900]   Absolutely.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.980]   What evidence do we have?
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:57.540]   What would you say from your best understanding of what was the relationship between Bill
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.860]   Clinton and Barry Seale?
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.660]   Barry said- and he knew that he couldn't get caught in Mena, Arkansas.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.780]   And when that movie was going to come out and be called Mena, somebody stopped it.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.220]   I mean, they stopped it dead in the tracks for two or three years, and the producer even
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.220]   quit.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.460]   You mean the American Made with Tom Cruise movie?
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.460]   It was an American-
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.460]   It was going to be called Mena?
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.980]   It was going to be the name that was written and produced in Mena.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:28.060]   And waiting on Hillary to be elected, they would not let that movie out.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.180]   And that movie was changed drastically.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.500]   But to push back on that, that doesn't mean there's truth there.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:38.980]   That means they were worried about the power of the conspiracy theory, which stuck.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:39.980]   Exactly.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.660]   I don't know.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:47.580]   I mean, some conspiracy theories, just because they're popular, doesn't mean they're true.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.420]   And ones that- but it also doesn't mean they're not true.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.220]   And there's ones that are not very popular that could be true.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.980]   But that one really stuck.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.700]   I mean, what's your sense?
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.940]   Well, I paid one and a half million dollars for Barry to land at Mena, Arkansas.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:08.940]   So I was pretty well assured that he couldn't get caught.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.980]   And I said, "Well, I can't get caught in Columbia.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.180]   We can't get caught in Nicaragua.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.060]   I guess we got a license."
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.060]   We went for it.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.620]   When you say, "I can't get caught," just to clarify, there's a sense where this is a safe
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.900]   place to land.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   Yes.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.980]   Like, completely safe.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:31.580]   So you don't think he was referring to some kind of, you know, like my grandfather who
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.900]   fought in World War II would talk about bullets can't hit him.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.500]   So it's almost like believing-
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   No, that wasn't.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.780]   He was taking that $50,000 and giving it to somebody.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.780]   To somebody.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.260]   And Barry was honest, so he wasn't just taking it from me because he was making a million
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.860]   dollars and he didn't care for the $50,000.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.180]   Oh, man.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:59.060]   Taking the story forward, the months leading up to his assassination, what do you understand?
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.060]   Why he was assassinated?
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:05.180]   Who were the players involved?
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.980]   Maybe could you have stopped it?
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:12.340]   Well, I'll tell you, after I saw Reagan's face on the television saying, "We have the
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.220]   absolute proof," the phone rang.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.220]   And it was Barry.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.740]   I hadn't heard from him in a couple years.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.180]   He said, "I'm coming out tonight, Roger."
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.980]   And I, "Oh, boy."
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   So he came out.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.260]   He said, "I'll meet you in this French restaurant.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.420]   I don't even know it in Santa Barbara."
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.420]   And I walked in.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.980]   There's about 20 or 30 people in there.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:39.940]   And they was all 30, 40 years old, women with plastic or leather skirts and men in their
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:40.940]   blue jeans.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.740]   And I looked around and Barry was at the back.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.220]   He was leaned up and he'd gained weight.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.820]   And I walked up and I said, "Barry, are you wired?"
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.820]   He said, "No."
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.540]   I said, "Well, I'm not going to talk to these DE agents."
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.100]   He said, "Every one of them."
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.100]   So-
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.580]   Oh, with jeans and skirts.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.580]   I like it.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.580]   Oh, boy.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.820]   I said, "Well, Barry, I'm going to sit here and you just talk to me, buddy, and tell me
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.820]   what's on your mind."
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.460]   And he sat there and he just went to talking.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:13.540]   And he told me about he was left holding a bag and that-
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.540]   What do you mean by that?
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.820]   Like that nobody's supported him?
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   Nobody helped him out?
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.820]   Well, I think that's something or another.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.140]   He was, and I don't know this.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:27.540]   I mean, this is just what happened, putting it all together, that he had some CIA buddies
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.260]   that was pretending, "We're going to supply all over North with arms.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.740]   And with that, you can land cocaine back here by the ton."
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:42.500]   So he's taking his little planes and putting some AK-47s and maybe ammunition or whatever,
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:49.060]   and takes it down to the country against the Communist Party of Nicaragua, where we've
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.440]   been landing.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.340]   And all over North was involved in this.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:46:00.540]   So when all that, and so his CIA buddies was certainly involved, and we know they were.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.100]   And Barry had been in the CIA earlier when he first got out of school.
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:13.740]   So when, as I say, the shit hit the fan, they all fled and left Barry holding the bag.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.380]   The CIA and the DEA?
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   Not the DEA, the CIA.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.220]   The DEA wasn't in on it.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.660]   The CIA was selling that cocaine, bringing it in.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.580]   Just to clarify, what's Iran-Contra scandal?
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:37.220]   What was the alleged involvement of the CIA in using drug trade to fund things?
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.940]   What do you know?
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.100]   What do you think is true?
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.100]   What should we know?
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.580]   Well, I know.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:49.260]   What I know is true, that Barry was taking a small amount of arms back to Central America
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:54.740]   and giving them to whoever Oliver North group were.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.780]   Oliver North was a colonel that got implemented and almost brought the government down.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.960]   And so they said, "All right, we're getting the guns from Iran, and we're taking cocaine
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   to pay for them.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.060]   And since Congress won't give us money to fight this war, we're going to circumvent
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.220]   it."
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.300]   So that was a whole thing.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:20.340]   So it was a CIA's effort to circumvent the funding mechanisms of government by selling
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.340]   drugs.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:26.860]   Yes, but it was a handful of renegade CIA agents, they were Barry's friends, that was
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.340]   making a load, load of money.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.340]   Tons of it come up.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:37.620]   If you would like to read the book, The Big White Lie, The CIA and the Crack Cocaine Epidemic,
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:45.540]   the CIA put, according to the book, Michael Levine, I didn't remember his name last
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.380]   time I talked, wrote that book.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:54.100]   And he was a head CIA agent, he was a head DEA agent that exposed this.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.820]   And the CIA tried to kill him.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:00.540]   And he says they put crack cocaine, they developed, their chemists developed crack.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.300]   And they put it in every city in the United States on one weekend.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.740]   So they were bringing it up by the tons, and that's for sure.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.020]   And Barry was bringing it.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.860]   Can I ask you a small tangent question?
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:18.780]   Do you think the public should trust the CIA and the DEA?
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:24.100]   Do you think they're mostly good people that are carrying out a good mission?
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.900]   Because this kind of makes it sound like there's renegade agents that are just doing whatever
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.220]   the hell they want, and with sometimes no regard for human life.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.540]   And that's certainly true.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.020]   But that's not everybody in there.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:41.580]   That's just sometimes you get a few policemen in the department that do these things.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.060]   I don't believe, I believe that our government is good.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.780]   I think we got some fools running it.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:51.020]   I don't know how we get them there, but I don't think I know.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.540]   Okay, so what was Barry's involvement here?
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:01.420]   So Barry leaned back in that chair and he told me that he got caught with one and a
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:10.220]   half tons and he bellied it in the runway in Nicaragua and had cameras flashing inside
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   and out.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:17.540]   And he flew it back to Homestead with an agent there and he brought the agent over, Jake
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.500]   Jacobson, really nice fellow.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.500]   I think he was a crop duster.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.700]   If we'd have got along, we'd have been on the right side.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.260]   And so we sat there and drank Chevy's Regal until I got pie-eyed.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.420]   And Barry told me about it.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.900]   He said that he went to see Edwin Meese.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:37.260]   He got out on bail and he flew his Learjet up to Washington and went in to see the attorney
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.140]   general, Edwin Meese.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.300]   And they run him out of the office.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:46.180]   The next day he went back and said, "I have absolute proof that the CIA is bringing tons
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.860]   of cocaine or they're running tons of cocaine into the United States."
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.660]   And Edwin Meese put him up with this agent, Jacobson, I believe it was.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.500]   And they went down and got one and a half tons.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:02.420]   And on the way back, they bellied it in and Pablo Escobar and some of the other ones,
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.300]   on general there in Nicaragua, you can see them toting it from one plane to the other
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   in the book called The Kings of Cocaine.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.220]   It's got a mention of me too.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.740]   And also the other one has a mention of me in it.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:20.740]   Said I'm in more files for the DEA than Noriega.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.540]   So who wanted to get rid of Barry?
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.860]   Who wanted to get rid of Barry more?
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.940]   The cartels or the CIA?
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.220]   The cartel.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.780]   But so Barry leaned back and he told me the story.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.060]   And the tears came down between his fingers as he put his hands over his eyes.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.420]   And he said, "I just couldn't do it, Roger.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.620]   I just couldn't do three life sentences.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.620]   So I've told him everything.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.860]   I went to Congress and I've testified before Congress."
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.180]   He testified before Congress for all these things that he'd done.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:54.340]   And he said, "I told him all about you, but you're under my umbrella.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.620]   You got to testify with me before grand jury in Miami."
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:02.060]   And so the guy said, "You can come down," the DEA agent said, "You can come down tomorrow
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:07.380]   with Mari first class or I'll take you down in chains.
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.820]   And if you don't testify with Barry, the only place you'll ever see your wife and family
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.580]   again is in a federal prison visiting room."
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.060]   Was that a difficult conversation?
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.300]   Oh, my eyes, my guts was just like ice water.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.580]   I can't testify against my friends.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.580]   I just can't do it.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.980]   How am I going to do it?
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.980]   I can't work with people.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.980]   And he was honest with me.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.620]   How am I going to testify against them?
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.660]   I can't spend the rest of my life in a federal prison.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:37.140]   What on earth, what a mess, Barry, you've got me into.
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.820]   So- Is that a kind of betrayal there?
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:45.340]   Yes, but it's still, I wish he'd left me out of it.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:51.700]   I understand him getting in such a mess that he told because if the CIA and whoever else
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.020]   was behind him betrayed him, then he's going to tell everything.
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.580]   So I says, "All right, I'll be in Miami."
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:02.340]   So Mari and I flew down first class and I went to a lawyer, one of the biggest lawyers
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.340]   in Miami.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.260]   And I said, "Man, I am in a mess.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.740]   This fellow's told everything and I've got to say something, but I'm not a snitch, man.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.580]   I mean, I can have, what can I do?"
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.380]   And he said, "Well, being a snitch is like being pregnant.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.380]   You either are or you're not."
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:26.220]   And he says, "I don't represent snitches, but if you want to fight this case, I'll do
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   it for $600,000."
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.020]   And boy, my face turned red.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.020]   "Well, I'm not a snitch."
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.700]   He said, "Well, that's what you're talking about."
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.700]   He said, "Let me tell you something.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.460]   If you go in there and say one thing and sign that paper and you don't tell them everything
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:43.340]   you know, then they will convict you of everything you've ever done and you tell them.
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.740]   So you can't do it."
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:49.300]   So I said, "Barry, I'm having trouble with a lawyer.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.300]   I'll go tomorrow.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.300]   Let's go."
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.700]   He said, "All right, use my lawyer."
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.380]   And he gave me his card, the lawyer's card.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:59.500]   So Murray and I went to the festival restaurant that night and Barry and Debbie came in.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.620]   She was dressed pretty and Barry wasn't.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:02.780]   So we was already about finished.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.500]   So we had dessert together.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.220]   And I said, "Barry, they're going to kill you, friend."
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.180]   He said, "No, they ain't going to kill me.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.460]   So and so, such and such is gone and this and the other."
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.900]   I said, "Barry, they're going to kill you, man.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.220]   You can't deny it."
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.660]   And I didn't tell him I wasn't going to testify.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.740]   So I hugged his neck.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.940]   I really like, and we fled to Brazil.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.740]   I took Murray and the children and went to Brazil.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.740]   - So you decided there you're not going to stay.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.980]   - I knew I didn't know what I could do.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.980]   I talked to a lawyer.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.820]   I mean, I just didn't, I didn't know what I could do, but the best in Miami said what
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.940]   he told me.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:38.940]   So I had to go.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.940]   - And you went to Brazil.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:40.940]   - We went to Brazil.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.780]   - Did you have a conversation with anybody at the cartel?
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:54.300]   I mean, that's such an interesting moment that tests the man's character to not snitch.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.100]   And did you have a conversation with anybody?
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.100]   - No.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.100]   - Pablo was about it.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.780]   - No, not at all.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.260]   - So it's just understood.
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.580]   - I just didn't, couldn't do it.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.660]   - But how many men like you are there?
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:07.660]   - Not many.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.420]   I had all my friends testified against me.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.260]   I had 11 friends and every one of them put their finger up, Roger did it.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.300]   And I was facing life, continuing criminal enterprise.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.540]   - And still you couldn't do it.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.540]   - I just couldn't do it.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:21.940]   - Did you ever get respect from the cartels for that?
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.620]   - Oh, there was a time I got back and stuff.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.060]   They owe me money and I can't get it.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.100]   - Well, that's about money.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.700]   I just mean about human beings.
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.900]   - Oh, I think so.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.540]   I've been back down there and I've been welcomed.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:39.460]   I have my contact and when I was in Brazil, I was trying to get this money.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.420]   They owe me three and a half million dollars.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.140]   So I called up there and he was gonna pay me.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.180]   Oh, I got 600,000 today and I'll get you some more tomorrow.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.300]   And then the next week I called, hey, I got great news, great news.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.020]   Barry Seal's been killed.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.300]   So oh no, and I went back to the hotel.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.940]   We was up in the northern part of Brazil and where was it, Maddy?
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:08.100]   And so I went back and I told Mari and Miriam and they cried and I cried.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.100]   I really cried.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.820]   - How is that great news from the cartel perspective?
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.580]   - Oh, well now there's no case against me and him and them.
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.820]   - Do you know who killed them?
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.820]   - Yes.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.220]   I'll tell you about that story.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:26.140]   On the first load I did, I landed at a banana plantation and it was raining and it was a
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.180]   muddy strip, clay.
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:32.540]   And they put the 300 kilos of cocaine and then the ugliest man you could imagine, named
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:38.580]   Ronaldo, got in there with a Mac-10 and he would make sure I took it to Louisiana.
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.580]   So--
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.580]   - This is many years before.
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.260]   - Yeah, a couple of years before.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:50.260]   So anyway, we took off and the mud got up in the wheel well so thick until the wheels
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.260]   wouldn't come up.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.860]   Well, I'm going 200 miles an hour instead of 300 miles an hour with wheels coming down.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.900]   Well I can't go back there.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:02.820]   If I do, I'm going to be in the same situation until the sun dries it out in a few days.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:08.820]   And so, but in Belize I had a runway that had been used for $10,000 used to refuel.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.660]   So I told the guy, "Listen, we got to land in Belize to refuel."
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:13.660]   "No, no, no."
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.940]   He put the Mac-10 and I'll shoot you.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:16.940]   "Go ahead, fool.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.940]   You're going to die too."
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.420]   So I was in the turf.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.220]   - He wasn't just ugly, he was also angry.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.060]   - He was a bad, bad killer.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:31.780]   So he's the one that actually killed Barry, the one that went up on the first load with
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.820]   me and Ronaldo and he's doing life.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.340]   - So he's just a killer.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.340]   - Yeah.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.900]   He's doing life in Louisiana.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.620]   - I wonder who, is it known who made that decision?
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:50.780]   - The younger Ochoa brother, I understand, Favio, was the one paid for the hit.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.580]   I don't know that, but that's what I've heard and it probably sounds about right.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.100]   He's down in Jessup, Georgia, doing a long, long time.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.380]   I think he's about to get out.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:03.460]   He's been in 30 years or whatever.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:09.420]   - The movie "American Maid," what do you think that movie got right?
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.500]   What did it get wrong?
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.500]   - Almost everything wrong.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.100]   It was disgustingly wrong.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.420]   - Okay, which parts?
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.580]   Can you maybe elaborate?
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:27.220]   - It was about Barry Seal and it just didn't even, it was nothing.
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.660]   Whoever wrote it had no idea who Barry Seal was.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:35.700]   They sat in a rocking chair and just tried to think of what was some baby bashing drug
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:41.660]   dealer doing and it's just like, "God, you just don't have any idea of the spirit of
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   the man."
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:47.500]   - So they wanted just to try to tell a fun story without actually studying the story.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   - They didn't know him.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.180]   They just had no idea.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.220]   And Barry was such a nice person, such a really nice gentleman person.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.580]   - They talked to you or no?
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.580]   - No.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   - The people that made the movie?
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   - No.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.780]   And I see all these people telling about Barry and never met him.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:02.780]   They tell him all about him.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.380]   I think that's just ridiculous.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:09.460]   And for one thing, for his character coming out of whorehouses and all that, that was
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.900]   just like ugly.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:16.420]   And then down in Columbia, putting a gun to his head, gonna take his sunglasses and then
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.940]   put $25,000 million worth of cocaine on his plane.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.980]   And then they go and bet $100 he don't have enough room to take off.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.980]   That's just insane.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.820]   I mean, just the whole thing.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.820]   And then he's talking to the DEA agents when he's coming up.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:36.300]   You don't know what frequency they own, how he's got five planes and they all split when
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.900]   the DEA comes out.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.100]   These are just somebody's fantasy.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:44.940]   - But those are details of the man, details of the story.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:50.660]   Is there some big profound things they missed about just this whole period?
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.860]   About that's something that's really important to you that was missed?
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:56.060]   - Yes.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:00.620]   They just try to sensationalize on little things that people remember.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.660]   And it's just not true.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:11.620]   It was just like a business deal and good people and good airplanes and good flying.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.300]   It was like a good watch that was made.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.820]   It just clicked and it just went on.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.940]   And they missed all that.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.500]   They tried to make it sound like it's something very ugly.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.180]   - Do you think there was a story that could have been told way better and still be a hell
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.180]   of a good story?
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.180]   - Oh my goodness, yes.
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:32.100]   - Well, there's a series called "Chernobyl" done by HBO.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:37.980]   And because I have sort of family connected to that period, they did an incredible job
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:42.900]   of being historically accurate and only not being historically accurate when it helped
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.460]   the story only in those rare cases.
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:51.980]   When they on purpose left the story to make it easier for people to understand, but it
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.500]   was still somehow accurate.
[00:59:54.500 --> 01:00:00.220]   And even though all the actors were British actors speaking English with a British accent,
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.620]   it was still somehow accurate.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.700]   Like they captured the spirit.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.220]   So it was historically accurate and the spirit was captured.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.900]   That was one of the most incredible series I've ever seen.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.580]   - It convinced me that the movie was made by non-Russians.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:23.020]   It convinced me that if you really care about a story, you don't have to have been brought
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   up in it.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.440]   You don't even need to speak the language.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.340]   If you're truly a scholar of it, if you talk to a lot of people, if you learn, if you just
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:34.740]   pour your heart and soul into it, you can create something really special.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.300]   And so your sense is you could do that with the story with this period of time.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.860]   - Oh yes.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.380]   It was a story that needs to be told.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.220]   It need to be told in the correct way.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.980]   Not like we're trying to bash a certain angle.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980]   - Yeah.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:55.340]   Well, if Netflix or HBO are watching this, you need to tell the story of Roger Rees,
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.340]   in my opinion.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.340]   There you go.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.060]   Is this young picture of you?
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060]   - Yeah.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.060]   - There you go.
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.060]   - That's from National Geographic.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.060]   - Jorge Arcoa, Pablo Escobar, it's you, Roger and Barry.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.060]   - Yeah.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.380]   - Smuggler, a memoir.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:15.260]   - Yeah, I really do hope that they make a movie of this one.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:20.260]   There's a movie called Blow that tells the story of George Young, Boston George.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.260]   Did you know George Young?
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.300]   That's one way to ask it.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.580]   The other is what do you think of the movie Blow?
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.380]   - I didn't know George Young, but it was a wonderful movie.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.860]   Absolutely, it captured it.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.860]   - It did?
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.860]   - Yes, it did.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860]   That's the way it should be.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.740]   - So he was a little bit before your time?
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.180]   - Exactly the same time.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.180]   - Exactly the same time.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.980]   - He was using stewardesses to fly the marijuana out of Manhattan Beach and I was on the fire
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.820]   department in Redondo Beach, 10 miles away, flying it up, sending it back.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.820]   Somebody was sending it back.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.060]   He might've been sending it back.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.700]   But he didn't have near the excitement that I did.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.780]   I was shot down twice.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.700]   I escaped from five different prisons.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.180]   I was tortured almost to death in a Mexican prison.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.340]   So he didn't have all that fun that I had.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.340]   - Fun in quotes.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.380]   - Yeah, it was a heck of a fun adventure.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.940]   Just to linger on a little bit.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.860]   So Johnny Depp plays George and Ray Liotta plays his father.
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:22.820]   And there's this son-father kind of scene at the end.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.020]   I don't know.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.940]   It's heartbreaking.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:36.260]   That scene paints a picture of a life that could have been had if none of this wild drugs
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.900]   smuggling happened.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:47.060]   I don't usually, I mean, I don't almost, I really never get like teary-eyed in a movie,
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.220]   but that got me.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:54.540]   It's almost like confronting at the end of your life, what your life could have been
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.540]   with your father.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:01.380]   The way he calls him Georgie.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.940]   Like you fucked up Georgie.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.940]   - Yes.
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.340]   I did too.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.340]   I really, really did.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.740]   Mario waited for me all those years and the children raised them without me.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.780]   Visited me in prisons all over the world.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.780]   Just unbelievable.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.100]   It's just nothing's worth that kind of money.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.100]   - Yeah.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:27.020]   Can you tell the story of when you were tortured nearly to death in a Mexican prison?
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.020]   - I sure can.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.100]   And I'm smiling, but it was nothing to smile about, I can tell you.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:37.180]   I was in a pool and a gentleman came over and shook hands with me and put handcuffs
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.180]   on me.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.180]   And I thought, what in the world?
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.260]   That was one of the nice hotels.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:47.620]   They put me in a jail cell and I sat there and all the trunks and thieves and stuff kept
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:50.940]   coming in and they had a bucket and it overrun.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.900]   And I said, I remember like 18 people in a room about 12 foot square.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.980]   Oh, it was hot and I thought, somebody's got to come get me.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:00.980]   This ain't real.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.580]   I hadn't done anything.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:08.340]   It was a pilot come to see me up in Hermosillo and he stopped and he made a mistake and went
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.260]   to the International Runway instead of where he was supposed to go.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.500]   And he had my phony name in his pocket, so they got me.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.180]   So they said I was a drug smuggler.
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:24.660]   So after about three days, they put me back into the back and it was a torture place.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.020]   And they put me in a little cell, I guess it wasn't hard, it wasn't six feet, it must
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.340]   have been about five feet square and about 12 feet high.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.460]   And it was June, the end of June, and it was hot.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.740]   I mean hot.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:41.340]   And they left me in there for, I guess, a few days.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.340]   You didn't know.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:48.360]   So every once in a while, they'd come drag me out and first off, they put my head underwater
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.740]   and it had seltzer in it or some kind.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.500]   And I took one whiff of that and three or four of them couldn't hold me down.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:58.820]   So then I learned that just before you have to breathe, tear loose like that and they'll
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.460]   let you up.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.940]   And that was the first treatment.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.860]   And then they started beating me.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.740]   And they beat me with a blackjack and rubber hose until I was black and blue and yellow
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.100]   from the bottom of my feet to my head.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.100]   What did they want from you?
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.820]   They wanted me to sign a confession that I was a drug smuggler.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.540]   And they put the papers under your nose.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.540]   This is all over if you'll sign.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.700]   Well, I knew if you signed, you got six years.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.420]   I wasn't gonna sign.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.420]   I wasn't gonna sign.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.220]   So they didn't want you to snitch on anybody.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.580]   They just wanted to say-- No, they just wanted me to sign that paper.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.580]   And you still didn't.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.580]   I didn't bow to them.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.580]   A beating ain't that bad.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:41.380]   So anyhow, he's getting me to the good part.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.580]   So then they come and they take me out.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.620]   I'm buck naked and they bend me over and they have things to pull you like chains, click,
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   click, click, click, click.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.780]   And they bent me over.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:56.420]   And they put butter on my bum and they commenced to put hot chili pepper up there.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.620]   And that stuff was bad.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.100]   I mean, it was red hot.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.540]   And that was awful.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.660]   And still-- That was just awful.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.100]   Yeah, but still you didn't-- I didn't think about it.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   I ain't gonna tell you.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.740]   I guess if I'd have known he was gonna kill me, I wouldn't have done it.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:19.220]   But I wasn't about-- You get hurt bad enough, you'll pass out.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.700]   So I didn't pass out.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.540]   So I was all right.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:27.340]   So then the last thing they did was they brought a dead man in there.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.340]   And he was frozen.
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.660]   He was wrapped in newspaper, little strips about a half inch wide, just like a mummy.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.220]   And he was frozen.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:37.420]   And they hung him on the wall with a meat hook.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.540]   And "You next, son of a bitch.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.140]   You next."
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.300]   And so he's sitting there like this.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.380]   And as he starts to thaw out, which is pretty quick, it looks like he's crying.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.220]   And it looks like he's peeing.
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.740]   And the paper starts unraveling on him.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.780]   And the formaldehyde puddles on the floor.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:00.340]   Ooh, what a smell, that rotten insides and the formaldehyde.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.300]   And there was a little space.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.420]   It wasn't even a half inch high under the door.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.300]   And I lay on that filthy floor with my cheek and put my lips right up under that door and
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   was sucking that fresh air.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.700]   And I went to sleep after some time.
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.620]   And I know where Walt Disney gets his ideas.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:20.780]   I saw white, pink pigs with wings on them, all kinds of stuff flying around.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:24.660]   So when I woke up, I didn't know which was real and which was the nightmare.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.500]   It took me a minute to figure out where I was and what was going on.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:34.460]   How did you stay mentally strong through that time?
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.460]   I don't know that I did.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.460]   Yeah, I was mentally strong.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.460]   So I was, just like I am now.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.460]   Stubborn.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:43.020]   I mean, you could be that man that could have killed you.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.320]   Yes, I could have.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.340]   So what gave you hope?
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.340]   Did you have hope?
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.700]   Or you were just a stubborn son of a bitch?
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.940]   I think some of both of it.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.540]   And I think they aren't going to keep you here forever.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.060]   You know, you're going to get out into the prison or they're going to let you go or something.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.660]   And if you sign that paper, you ain't going nowhere.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.660]   And I want to go home.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.220]   I got shot down a few weeks before that.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.780]   I got shot from out the sky.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.780]   It was 80 bullets.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.780]   I was through the plane, killed a fellow on the ground, shot the leg nearly off the man
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:13.780]   in that little place.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.780]   And they were shooting you from the ground.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.780]   All right.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:23.220]   A little 900-foot strip there at Pichilinga, a poor, poor village with starving donkeys.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.100]   That's where I'd give them $17,000 for the load.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.940]   And I'd go over on the highway and load.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.220]   Well, on day 13, I did a load every day for 13 days.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.660]   They had a bunch of marijuana, pretty good, piled up, and I was going to load a day.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:41.620]   And on day 13, I had that little warning sign going off in my stomach, "Uh-oh, uh-oh, don't
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:42.620]   do it."
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:47.820]   But I asked this Joaquin, "Oh, we had the Federales paid off, no worry."
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:54.620]   So I spent the night in a hammock and walked down to the airplane just as it getting daylight.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.380]   And 10 or 12 men walked with me, and Pedro got in.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.860]   I brushed my teeth in the little stream.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.020]   It was about a foot deep, a little river coming through there.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.620]   He got in the airplane, and I fired her up.
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.620]   Bam, blah, blah.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.620]   And bam, I thought a tire blew out.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.220]   I looked over and still ain't dawned on me.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:18.020]   And Pedro's yelling, "Police here, police here, Roger, police here."
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:23.580]   Well, it dawned on me, and I shoved the throttle to the firewall.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.580]   And I only had-
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   So that was a bullet.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.540]   Yeah, somebody off to the side, they'd shot.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:33.140]   They'd shot just a warning, like, "Get out, stop, we're going to rob you," whatever it
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.140]   is.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.140]   That's what they do.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.940]   They'd just taken the plane and me and put me in prison, the whole thing.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:42.260]   But even though I had papers, so I just shoved it to the firewall, and there wasn't enough
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.060]   room to take off on that strip.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.940]   And half of it was behind me, or some of it was behind me.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.540]   And so just at the end, I'm just like, I think that thing stalls at about 50 miles an hour,
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.540]   just turning 50.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.700]   And I just pulled it right up and put the flaps on.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:02.340]   And as I pulled off the ground, they opened up on both sides of me with machine guns,
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.780]   and they riddled that airplane.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:06.620]   I mean, the windshield came out.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.260]   I got hit three times.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.860]   You, like your body?
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:12.860]   Where did you get hit?
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.540]   Well, I didn't know I was hit.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.900]   I mean, it was just the gasoline just pouring in.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.900]   The world turned yellow.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.820]   I must have went into shock.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.740]   So it just stopped in slow motion.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:30.820]   And one bullet hit the strut right by my head, and parts of that bullet just went all over
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   me.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.620]   I just looked like I'd been peppered with lead.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.540]   And the gasoline was just pouring in.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:41.860]   I mean, just pouring in where they'd shot the wing up above, and the windshield's gone.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.860]   I mean, I can't, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:47.300]   It was just like a hailstorm.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   So I was-
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.780]   The airplane's stalled or no?
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.220]   I was in a stall anyway, and I didn't realize it.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.420]   And I guess you wouldn't unless you trained for it.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:59.980]   But when you're in a stall, the elevator is kind of flappy.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.260]   And I didn't realize it at the time.
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.180]   I thought they had shot the elevator cable in too.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.260]   So I thought, "Oh, God."
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:10.100]   So I just reached over and switched it off, switched it, pulled the mixture, pulled everything.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.220]   And in the river, there was rocks about as big as this table, and they were like the
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.700]   turtle back all the way up until there was a waterfall.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.820]   It was quite a pretty place.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.260]   And I crashed straight onto it.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.100]   I thought, "If I get those rocks."
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.700]   And when I did, the first time I hit, the wings came off, and then it bounced.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.860]   And the next time, the nose came up and came under the plane.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860]   And I'm sitting there.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.940]   I must have been knocked unconscious, because Pedro's shaking me.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:33.940]   "Come on, Roger.
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.940]   Come on, Roger."
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:39.500]   And I stepped out into the water, and here comes these four Federales still shooting
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   at us.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.060]   And I'm bullied to hit the airplane.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:49.020]   And I kept a 9-millimeter Browning high-power taped to the top of the radio in case I ever
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.020]   needed it.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.020]   [Laughter]
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.020]   It was one of those times.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.900]   Because you didn't want it in the airplane.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   So it was just handy.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.900]   You just lay in there.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.060]   So I took and popped a few caps out of them, and they ran into the rocks.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:05.340]   So we took off running, and then I looked, and Pedro's foot nearly shot off.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.820]   They'd shot him on one side of the ankle, and it just blown out the other side.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.380]   And it wasn't even hardly bleeding.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.820]   The shock of it.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:15.060]   So I took my T-shirt off and gripped it and tied it best I could.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.820]   But you had still bullets in you, so you could still run.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.900]   I shot the top of my toenail off.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.660]   I shot it across my head and my kneecap.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.020]   So I was just nicked.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.700]   It was very painful later on.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.380]   But right that time, it was just hot.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:35.020]   And there was a bullet still in my foot from it, a piece of a bullet, a good-sized slug.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.540]   So we went on up the mountain through the cactus.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.540]   Just running.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.540]   Just going, "I want to go down."
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.460]   "No, no, there are federales that go in the easy way.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]   Let's go through."
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   This young fellow.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.820]   And we came to an old donkey.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.140]   She must have been 30 years old, long and way back, long hair on her.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.140]   "Charlotte, Charlotte."
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.160]   And he petted the donkey, and we jumped on.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   And we rode for seven--
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   Like an actual donkey?
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   A donkey.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   There were donkeys all over the place.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.800]   I knew that one from the village.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.340]   And so we rode seven miles, two of us on a donkey with no bridle, no saddle, nothing.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:09.720]   And we came to a little man plowing a little horse and a little ox.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720]   Both of them spotted.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.300]   And the ox was--the yoke was across their back this way, and he's plowing with a little
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.780]   plow amongst thumps.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.980]   It was like one of these people clearing a little piece of land.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.300]   And he had a little house there.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:24.900]   And so we went into his house, and his wife and his daughter, they put like cloth over
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.820]   my wounds and on Pedro's.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.060]   It was terrible.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.140]   And they poured diesel oil on it to keep the flies off.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.660]   So I'm covered in diesel.
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.260]   So the man left, and he was gone all day.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:42.120]   And then about dark, he showed up, and he had about 15 or 20 horses and mules showed
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.420]   up in the yard walking fast.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.420]   And a doctor got out.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.300]   He said, "I'm Dr. Benjamin Soso with Red Cross."
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.300]   And he worked on my foot, and he worked on Pedro.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.540]   He gave us a shot of morphine and tetanus shots.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.340]   And he said, "You've got to get to hospital."
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.540]   He said, "Pedro will die if he don't get to hospital."
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:01.580]   He said, "They're looking for an American pilot that's been shot down, and they think
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:02.580]   he's dead.
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.420]   There was a lot of blood in that airplane."
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.820]   And so they rode.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.900]   I don't know how far we rode, but we rode miles.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.260]   And we'd come to a road, and there was a big truck, and it was loaded with corn in
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.260]   the ear.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.420]   And they dug holes in that corn and put us in it and covered us up.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.660]   And the road was rough, and every time we'd hit a dirt road, that corn would cover me
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.620]   up, and they'd scratch my face out again.
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:28.660]   And when we came to the highway, we went into a house, and they got me some clothes.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.460]   Mine was messed up.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:34.980]   And a white basin, and they must have brought 20 jugs of water different times.
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:39.340]   I kept washing and washing my foot till all the blood and the crud got off of me and put
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.020]   on those clothes.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.380]   And somebody went to—they said, "You can't go north of Rhodes Block.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.380]   They're looking for the pilot.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.160]   So you've got to go south."
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.540]   So they found a taxi in Mazatlan, and it was a rather new taxi.
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:56.340]   And the fellow would take me to Guadalajara, which was, I don't know, seven, eight hours
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.540]   south.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:02.140]   So we got in that taxi, and they propped me up with sheets and blankets and pillows in
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:06.980]   the back seat and gave me these great big white pain pills.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.920]   And I was quite content.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.300]   Then I was shot down in Columbia also.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.900]   Can you tell that story?
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.900]   I sure can.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:16.900]   All right.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:20.640]   I went down for a load of marijuana.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.100]   And we got to the place, and we got there too early.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.180]   And the guerrillas screamed, "You've got to get out of here.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.180]   You've got to get out of here."
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:31.940]   And so we went back to the place where we staged from and refueled.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.100]   I had a beautiful DC-3.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.500]   It carried three tons.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:45.620]   And so while I was waiting, I ate something for lunch, and I went around behind the house.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.620]   We refueled a plane up.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.620]   I had to wait till late in the afternoon.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.500]   They wanted me to come just at dark.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:55.000]   So the military planes couldn't see me on their strip.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.420]   So I'm laying in a hammock asleep, and I hear this terrible roar.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.420]   And I look right up through the trees, and at the ass end of two military jets going
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.160]   straight up.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.420]   They do a dive over, and they came back down the strip in front of that airplane, and they
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.920]   just tear it up with .50 caliber machine guns.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.040]   They just showing out.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.600]   So I run for the airplane.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.520]   I just give that guy $80,000, and he ran for the truck, and all the rest of them ran for
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.520]   the truck.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.160]   I should have ran with my money, but I didn't.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.000]   I ran for the airplane.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.800]   And the copilot got in, and his name was Al.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.680]   He got in with me, and two fellows got in the back.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.040]   We had drums of fuel in there to refuel when we got down to the gorillas.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.920]   So we took off, and I couldn't get the gear up because I'd taken off in such a hurry.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.120]   These pins in the struts of a DC-3, and with big flags on them, and you have to take them
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.040]   up so that the plane won't come up.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.660]   So these jets swarmed on me, and they tried to get me to go.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:55.400]   They kept telling me which way to go, and the pilot would be just as close as just right
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   over there.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   I could see him.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   I just held up the old hippie piece.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.240]   I didn't think they would shoot.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.080]   I really didn't.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.600]   Nobody had shot before.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.200]   So I kept flying out, and I kept getting slower and slower, and they kept slowing down, down,
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.760]   down, and the black smoke rolling.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.200]   And then they started shooting up under me, boom, boom, boom, boom, with them 20-millimeter
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.520]   cannons, and the tracers just going up.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.320]   They looked like they're curving up from me, and I, "Whoa," and I pushed the nose over
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.480]   so they couldn't get under me.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.600]   And later on, I heard they thought I tried to ram them.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.520]   So one of them went for fuel, and I kept on going, and the one just tore the left wing
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.680]   tip up with a .50 caliber, and then he come back again and shot the tail up.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.680]   He's warning me.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.200]   And I tell the fellow in there, I says, "You know, if you bring me enough water, I believe
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.520]   I can fly this thing."
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.860]   My mouth got quite dry.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:57.280]   So I went on, and I landed on a big pasture, and it was a huge pasture, and it was rougher
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.760]   than it looked, and the wings just flapped.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.800]   And I come to a stop and jumped out and pulled those tabs out and threw them on the ground
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.040]   so I could get my gear up.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:10.080]   And I understand that during the 1980 World Series baseball game that it says, "American
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.280]   DC-3 has just been shot down by American jets, by Colombian jets."
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.360]   You know, it's the first plane shot down on Reagan's New World on drugs.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   But he's up.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.640]   He's up and away, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.640]   We keep you posted.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.160]   So I took off again, and I went into a thunderstorm, and they came close to the mountains.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.200]   So I spiraled up, and every time I'd come out, that jet was there, boom, boom, boom.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:35.440]   And I dove back into that storm, boom, boom, boom, in there.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:38.000]   And at 20,000 feet, I started icing up.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.120]   So I went out one last time, and he was right there waiting.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.400]   He had me on radar.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.000]   So I went back in, and I kicked it over and put it into a spin and went straight down
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.200]   to 2,000 feet and come out under it.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:54.480]   And I was flying along the Guaviera River, and it was 20 feet above the water.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.040]   It looked like a pasture.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.700]   It was just grass.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:02.200]   And I made several runs to tear the grass down, and it looked like it felt hard.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.760]   That old DC-3 weighs 30,000 pounds.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.760]   And I put it down on the fifth run.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.120]   I said, "All right, we're going to land now."
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.480]   And as I was-- So you flew like close several times?
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.640]   No, I put the wheels down.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   Oh, you put the wheels down without landing?
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   And it's been about half a mile, and just-- So I'm making my run, you know?
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.840]   So, okay.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.080]   So you're being tracked by a jet.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   He's going.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.760]   Just trying to-- Well, before that.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.760]   Yes.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.680]   Before I'm telling the story how insane it is.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.120]   He's trying to shoot you down, and there's a thunderstorm that you're escaping into.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:42.660]   And then you do a spin down to, what, 2,000 feet, whatever you said, like somehow escaping
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.660]   all of this.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:51.840]   And then you try to land on a pasture on a giant heavy plane that carries three tons
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:58.760]   by touching down five or six times to make a landing strip for yourself.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.720]   Yeah, the grass is three or four feet high.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.520]   So it looked really good after a few times.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:07.240]   So then just before it stopped, I said, "Al, take your feet off the brakes."
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.120]   He said, "I don't have my feet on the brakes."
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.880]   Well, I knew I had broken through the crust.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.960]   And I put full power on, but it didn't.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:18.480]   That old big plane just come on down, and it just did a head-- As it came to a stop,
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.760]   it did a headstand, 90 degrees to the ground.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.260]   And the engines held it up, and the nose and all just crushed in right on it.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.600]   We fell between the two seats to keep from getting killed.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.320]   And when it come to a stop, all that fuel was pouring out on those hot engines, and
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.680]   there's an escape hatch at the top.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.800]   I just stepped out, took my suitcase with me.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   Was there fire?
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   No fire.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.000]   It left the plane there, and the two guys that was in the back one of them broke his
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.980]   thumb, and it was with the barrels.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:52.440]   And they had to put a hose, a tie gas hose together to shimmy down to get out.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.560]   So-- That's an incredible story.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.120]   Well, let me just tell you, it had a little bit more to it.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.600]   I learned to fly with the idea of being a missionary aviation fellowship pilot.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.440]   Fly the missionaries in and out of the jungle.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.520]   Well, I went 11 days through that jungle.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.040]   The rest of them went on down the road and went to prison.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:13.680]   I said, "I'll crawl on my belly six months, a year, a year, eating snakes before I'm going
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.960]   down the road."
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.280]   So I went in there, and I was 11 days in the jungle.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.600]   And I finally came to a place, and it had airplanes.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.080]   I kept asking the Indian, "Donde esta el avion?"
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.760]   I wanted to steal an airplane and get out of there.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.200]   And when I came to the place, I asked, "What is this place?
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   Lovely place.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.840]   It looked like Honolulu in World War II."
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.120]   There was a runway there.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.880]   He said, "You don't know.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   This is Loma Linda headquarters for Missionary Aviation Fellowship for the Amazon."
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.320]   And they flew me out.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.040]   You escaped from prison five times.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:58.720]   So what stands out to you as the most difficult or miraculous escape in the bunch?
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.720]   The most, like, miraculous was when I was in the courtroom in Spain.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.960]   I think I was on the third floor of Real High, and I ran across the courtroom, handcuffed,
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960]   kicked the window out.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.480]   And I looked down, and it was above the palm trees.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.960]   I thought there might be a power line or something I could grab on as I went down.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   There was nothing.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.000]   And there was a car parked, a station wagon on the--
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.560]   You just jumped out?
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.800]   I jumped out from 31 feet and on top of that car.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.640]   And it exploded in the street.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.680]   The windshield went over three or four cars.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:31.000]   It looked like snow going up, and I looked like Donald Duck with the thing coming out.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.240]   And handcuffed, and I got out.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240]   And you just kept running?
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240]   Yeah, I kept running.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.800]   They ran me down, hit me in the back.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.040]   I still got a dead spot in my back where the policeman hit me with a shotgun.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.480]   And they brought me back.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   Everybody was there.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.680]   They were saying, "Your husband is crazy."
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680]   That was spectacular.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.720]   But I escaped from Lübeck, maximum security prison, and I cut out of there and got out.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   That was a miraculous escape.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720]   And that was where?
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720]   In Lübeck, Germany.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.480]   What was that escape like?
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.560]   I was there, and they were going to extradite me back to the United States where I still
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.640]   had all these charges and 25 years special parole.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:13.760]   And I was cleaning the lawyer's visiting room, and on it was bars that looked like
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.080]   piano notes or this way to make it pretty.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.080]   But there was a little bit.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:25.940]   So I got a rope from a guy where they made boats in there, and I had 20 minutes.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:29.080]   So I went in there, and I wrapped it around, and I put a broom handle in it that was cut
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:33.120]   off and wrapped it around until they pulled the bars together on that side.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.400]   And then I pulled them together on the other side.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.800]   But that only put me inside the prison yard where the soccer equipment was kept.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:45.200]   But they were putting new windows on one side of the prison, and they had it scaffolded
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.540]   up to the fourth floor.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:52.000]   So there was a little recess there, and there was guard towers every 100 feet or so.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.940]   I mean, they would shoot and kill you.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:58.960]   So I got behind that and climbed up holding to the bricks on one hand and the scaffolding
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.480]   on the other and went to the roof.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.000]   I lost my shirt and most of my clothes going through the window.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.480]   I got all the skin off of me.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.880]   I thought I was going to die.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.600]   And I was trying to go sideways like this, and finally I got a grip, and the bars let
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.480]   me through and took all the skin off of me.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.800]   So I got up on that roof, and I have asthma, and I just lay there trying to catch my breath.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   Didn't bring my inhaler.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   So I mean--
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.800]   Dr. Mark McClellan With blood everywhere.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.720]   Dr. Mark McClellan Oh, I was bloody, yes.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.560]   And so I got down to the end, and on the end, the reason I did it, they were putting a new
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:33.040]   wall again around the prison to make it larger.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.800]   And they had taken all the wire off above the sally port where they could join the two
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.280]   walls together, and I saw that when I came up.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.560]   And there was a guard, a half of a--like a dome sticking out of that brick building where
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   there's a guard there with a gun, and he'd kill you.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.160]   I mean, he was made--he was surely trained to kill you.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:54.080]   And we had some bad people in that place.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.920]   So I lay up one floor above it, and I saw a guard and his wife come with a double umbrella.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.800]   It was just pouring down rain.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.280]   Here I am without a shirt on, bloody.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:07.360]   And he had a little boy--she had a little boy with him under that double umbrella.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360]   I knew him.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.720]   And when he come--and she started back from the sally port.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.360]   I hit the top of that guard tower, bam, with both feet.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.200]   And I jumped, I guess, it's three more floors.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   I jumped.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.440]   There was a pile of sand, like a cone where they were digging it there.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.200]   And I hit that, and my feet buried up to the knees, but I didn't fall.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.960]   And I ran straight towards her so he couldn't shoot me.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.160]   And then I went around some bushes and went downhill.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.880]   And then I heard, "Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam," behind me.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.280]   And I looked, and that fool woman was in a big old car, and she was knocking down the
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.280]   parking meters behind me.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.780]   She was trying to run over me.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:48.160]   And I ran behind the car, and she tore the fender off of her car, trying and yelling,
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:52.680]   "Yap, yap, yap," and a terrible evil-looking face at me, screaming at me, and the sirens
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.040]   going off in the prison.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.040]   And there was a fence there, a wall, and I jumped up on it to jump over.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:03.560]   And it had glass embedded, and I cut my hands and my arms all up getting over that.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.440]   And I hit the ground on the other side, and it was like--it was that muck where some farmer
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.440]   had dug it.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.840]   I dug in there, and Marty had slipped me $200 into prison, and I had that in my shoe, and
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.320]   I lost my shoes in that muck.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.960]   Anyway, I got out of there and got to Holland.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.800]   Any heck of a story how I did that.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.280]   What was prison like, whether it's Germany or whether it's Australia?
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.240]   What were some of the darker moments in prison?
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.480]   The United States prisons are awful, awful, evil places now.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.960]   Just really, there's nothing nice about them.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.520]   There's the guards-- In L.A.?
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.240]   In every one I went to.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.680]   It seemed like the further east.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.440]   I went to Oklahoma, and it was nicer.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.920]   But all of them on the west coast, there was hatred there, and they got really stupid people
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.400]   hired just incredibly.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.240]   Oh, hatred by the guards.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.240]   And the inmates.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:00.000]   Like, I speak Spanish, and I walked into the Spanish TV room, and it would send you a note,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.200]   "You can't come in here."
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.200]   And I walked across to the black, "Hey, get out of here," white boy.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.520]   It was just like, "What?
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.440]   Man, I like all you people, you know?"
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.000]   And so I walked down to the white people, and they said, "Show us your paperwork.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.640]   You can't come in here until you show your paperwork.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.280]   We don't let snitches and homosexuals and all this sort of stuff in here."
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.440]   So it's just like, "Man, I don't want to be in here."
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.080]   I mean, it sounds absurd, but you're saying the basic humanity is gone.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   Completely.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080]   Completely.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.080]   And the guards, it was just like, "Come here, Reeves."
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.520]   And I walk up to him, "Get the fuck out of my face."
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.080]   He sticks his chin out, like for me to break his jaw.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.040]   Like, "What in the world, man?
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   I love people."
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.440]   Yeah, you got this joy to you.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.720]   You have a joyful nature.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.760]   And it didn't seem like that broke you.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.960]   Not a bit.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.960]   How did you persevere?
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.680]   Did you know, I didn't even think I persevered, but I try to enjoy my life wherever I am every
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:01.680]   day.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   I do.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.160]   I ran every day, and like I told you, "Why do you run so, Roger?"
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.600]   I said, "To help me suffer these fools."
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.360]   And I played a game of chess every day, almost of my life in there.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.560]   And I read two books a week.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.960]   And I talked with people, storytellers, guys would come in, "Tell us another story, Roger.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   Give us a poem.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.560]   Tell us one you never told us before."
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.560]   And so it was just nice.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:29.160]   A lot of them Aboriginal boys, they picked their country music, and it was all right.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:35.800]   Read Morgan Freeman's character in The Shawshank Redemption, says the following, "These walls
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.040]   are funny.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.600]   First you hate them, then you get used to them.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.240]   Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.840]   That's institutionalized."
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.840]   Is there truth to that?
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.840]   A hundred percent.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.760]   I didn't even see the walls, except whenever I was planning on escaping.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.520]   In Shawshank Redemption, he spent so many years in prison that he almost didn't know
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:04.080]   what to do with himself once he left, once he was a free man.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:15.760]   That's the, you get so used to the system, the rituals, having to follow orders, even
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.320]   being treated poorly, all those kinds of things that you become dependent on.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.600]   Well down in Australia, I spent the first a little over a year in the shoe.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:31.280]   It was like, did you see the movie The Silence of the Lambs?
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280]   Thank you, Marty.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.080]   And he's there, and I had five or six guards looking at me with one way mirror.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.000]   And that's whenever I thought I might never get out, I got a life sentence.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.240]   I had all this time waiting here in Germany.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:50.120]   And so they had a computer in there, but it didn't have a program on it.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.720]   And I wrote, so I just started writing these little stories, that's what I did in my life.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.080]   And I wrote one line, and I wrote over a million words with them looking at me.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.960]   So it was after a year, they let me out.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:04.360]   And it wasn't long before they put me in a place called self-care.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.960]   And particularly, I was in what they call the lifers pod.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   There was 268 men in self-care there.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:18.160]   And it was unbelievably good that we were left alone, basically.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.680]   They was there, or the guards were certainly there, but they had their shack, and we had
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.000]   apartments, four apartments to the building.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.400]   And six men to the unit with your own door and a key to it, and a kitchen, dining room,
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.160]   freezer, refrigerator.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.500]   And they gave you, allowed you $360 a week to buy groceries.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:43.200]   And I cooked for about 16 years, and learned to cook good.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.880]   And the people, and other people have their specialties.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:53.200]   And so that was quite, it wasn't so like being in prison.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.560]   It was somewhat living with me, and it was difficult, man.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:00.760]   I had some good fights and carry on, but you don't get along with everybody.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:05.640]   But then whenever I came back to the United States, I was laughing and talking.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:11.080]   And when I got off the plane in LA, I had three marshals with me from Australia.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.000]   I was slammed upside the wall.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:21.360]   I mean hard, put my ankle, my back's on, and handcuffed so tight till they cut my leg off.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.960]   Face forward, face forward, hands apart.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.240]   Good gracious.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:29.400]   And walked me 50 steps, and turned me over to the marshals, and they took part of that
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.400]   off.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:36.320]   That was a border patrol that was there over my marijuana charge from 1977.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.560]   I did 11 years for parole violation.
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.460]   Now they want me for more violation.
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:45.600]   And they put me in, down in Los Angeles, they put me in, the marshals put me in there, and
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.600]   they put me in isolation.
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:50.040]   I thought, "What in the world they got me for isolation for?
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.280]   I done anything."
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.600]   How long did you spend in isolation?
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.280]   More than six months.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:03.240]   So I, after three or four days, the little Judas window slide open, and a man, a nice
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.720]   looking man in a suit come there.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.440]   "Hello Reeves, I just want to see what you look like.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:12.480]   I saw your National Geographic documentary, and it does me pleasure to keep you in isolation."
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.320]   And he slammed the thing, and I couldn't get out of there.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.360]   And by law, the US Parole Commission is supposed to give you a hearing within 90 days.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.640]   Tamari paid a lawyer $7,500, and he never picked up the phone.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.800]   Somebody got to him.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.960]   Who's that somebody you think?
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:34.400]   Christopher Cannon was his name, and I don't know who got to him, but he didn't do anything
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.760]   to get me out of there.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:40.720]   I got one 15 minute phone call a month, and I couldn't get out.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:47.680]   So then after six months, they shipped me to, put me on Con Air.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:54.440]   Little shackled and black box on my hands, and I went to Oklahoma, and they let me out
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440]   on the floor.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:02.840]   I couldn't imagine, then I could call after a couple of days, and they said, "There was
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.560]   a man here from Washington give you a parole hearing.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.200]   You only got here at 3.30."
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.200]   So he left.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200]   He said he'd be back next year.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.200]   What?
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.160]   I've been in there over six months.
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.680]   So then there was a lovely little lady.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.920]   She was a case manager or something.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.040]   She said, "You can ask for a parole on the record."
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.040]   I said, "Please do."
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.920]   She said, "I'll send them an email."
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.640]   The next day I got my parole.
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.760]   90 days later, they sent me to Terminal Island and put me in the place there with the infilade,
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.800]   I guess, since I'm as old as I am, 78 years old.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:37.240]   So they put me in people in there dying, and wheelchairs and legs off and arms off and
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.240]   cancer.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.120]   So I was in there, and I pushed the fellas around.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.680]   I come out of the chow hall there, and I went to go to the right to get me a haircut.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.360]   There were two Mexican guys there, a lieutenant and another one, between us.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.720]   He went like, "Boop, boop, boop."
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.760]   I said, "I could outrun you."
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:59.160]   They slammed me, put me on the ground, handcuffed me, and put me in the shoe for a week.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.200]   I got out, and man, they put me back in the place.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.240]   They treated me rough.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.840]   So I got in a little more trouble, and they put me back in the shoe, and I wouldn't come
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.840]   out.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.440]   They had that...
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.120]   The virus was out killing people.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.960]   So they killed eight people in that unit I was in.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.760]   So, I mean, I wouldn't even come out to take a shower.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.960]   I had a little straw that I put in the sink, and I'd take a sock that I had and scrub myself
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.680]   with it with some soap and glass of water over my head, and then clean the floor up
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680]   and put it in the toilet.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.760]   So that was your time during the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:40.480]   I got out last April, right in the middle of it, and they were dying bad in there.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.960]   So I was treated worse for that last year in America than I was for the whole 20 years
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.760]   in Australia, the 18 years in Australia.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.800]   And then you were a free man at the end of that year.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.600]   They put me out and sent me home, and the parole officers couldn't even come.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600]   They weren't working.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.200]   They were just doing everything by video.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.040]   Said, "Better not have a drink."
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.700]   The only thing was I couldn't even have a drink of wine.
[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:09.160]   So after a year, I had to take psychiatric treatment every week.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.280]   I had to go talk to the psychiatrist, psychologist, and me and her got along great.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.560]   She was a good Christian woman.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.560]   We just chatted and talked.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.200]   And I think they said, so I had to pee in the bottle every week.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.400]   I said, "I've been in 33 years.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.320]   How many piss deaths do you think I've had?
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.600]   I've never been dirty.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.400]   Only thing if y'all want to clean one, you come get me."
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.440]   Before I talk to you about love, let me ask you a difficult question.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.400]   You write in your book, "I don't consider myself much of a criminal.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:43.520]   I don't lie, cheat, or steal, and I always take up for the underdog.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.080]   Violence makes me sick.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:51.280]   Yet, I know I'm an outlaw, and those that break the law must be punished."
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.040]   I think many people listening to this, or some people listening to this, will see you
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.960]   as a criminal, as a bad man, who increased the amount of suffering in this world.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.040]   What do you have to say to them?
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:12.800]   I would like to tell them that they have been indoctrinated by the spin of news and politicians,
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.560]   and they don't know the truth of the situation.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:19.600]   You lay the truth out there in an envelope and let me open it, besides something else
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.100]   that is false, and it's staggering.
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:30.320]   The truth is that I was a tobacco farmer, and tobacco kills 500,000 people a year in
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:38.000]   America, and six million have debilitating diseases because of it.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.160]   All drugs combined kill between 10,000 and 15,000 people a year by overdose, and 60%
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.680]   of those are pharmaceutical.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:50.360]   Now then, when I was a tobacco farmer, come sit on the front pew, Mr. Reeves.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.220]   Come on up here, you gentlemen.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:56.400]   You just joined the Masonic Lodge, and you joined our church, and you just come on and
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.260]   sit down with the good people.
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:02.640]   You grow two marijuana plants, get out of here, you scumbag.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.400]   Marijuana doesn't hurt anybody.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   That's the truth of it.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:18.040]   In your career, you walked amidst violence, but you never participated in the violence.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.000]   I didn't even see it.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   Just didn't happen around me.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   In prison, it did.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   I sewed people up.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   They called me Doc.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.880]   I had dental floss.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:39.200]   One time I had to get a blade and try to help keep them from my patient, from getting again.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.720]   If I shot at those people, I shot at them to keep them from killing me.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.760]   I certainly didn't mean to kill them.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.720]   Some people are evil, and they will kill you and hurt you, lie to you.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.480]   I just don't do any of that.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.200]   It just makes you sick.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.920]   When I was in the shoe, three guys tried to kill a guy, and they stabbed him so many times,
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.440]   but their stab went breaking, and the blood getting out of the room.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.440]   I said, "You're going to kill him.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.200]   You're going to kill him and save his life."
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.320]   Drug him up there where the guards could see him.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.520]   There's stuff like that.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.040]   I'm just not of that nature of those people.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.040]   They're just evil.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.440]   They're people born evil, I believe.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:21.520]   It is heartbreaking to hear that the basic humanity is gone in prison in the United States.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.360]   It's heartbreaking because that basic humanity is actually the light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:30.080]   It's the thing that saves us as opposed to when it's absent, it's the thing that destroys
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.080]   us.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:38.440]   The prisons are filled, absolutely filled with people that have some mental problems.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.800]   You see tent city all the way up and down here.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:46.000]   I guarantee you every one of those people have mental problems to some degree, however
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.800]   little it is, but they're a little bit off.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.320]   When you get a DEA agent that wants to make a name for himself, he goes down there and
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.120]   gets two of them, one of them to sell a little two grams of methamphetamine to the other
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.000]   one, and he gets a conviction.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.920]   A young prosecutor, he gets a conviction.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.680]   He wants to make a judge.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.680]   We got the judge in, where was it?
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.120]   I'm going to give a million, what was his name?
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.120]   Gilbert.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.560]   I'm going to give him in a million years before I get off the judge.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.840]   You get fools like that in charge.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:21.720]   You're going to fill prisons up with pitiful humanity.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.720]   Those are the ones.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.040]   Then the other is people over drugs.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.840]   Drugs should be a health issue.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:36.840]   You cannot police it enough.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.440]   They know the only thing that overdoses is opioids, the heroin.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.920]   If they can give it to them, it costs about a dollar a day to give the worst addict his
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:49.960]   fix, but they'll give it methadone, which is from a pharmaceutical company, which is
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.640]   just as bad.
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.640]   Why in the world?
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:57.840]   We tried it all over the world, in Portugal and England.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.840]   When they give the girls clean up, no more stolen cars.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.840]   Why?
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.280]   Who wants to keep this farce going?
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.520]   They're just perpetuating it like, "Oh, every little police place is getting all these suits
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.400]   and armor and machine guns."
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.480]   It's just like, "Oh, it's such a spin.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.480]   It's sad."
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.440]   Do you think all drugs should be legalized?
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.960]   I don't know about that, but they certainly should be controlled.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:32.840]   If a person is an addict, he should be able to go down and get his fix with somebody there
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.120]   to help him with a clean needle and a glass of orange juice.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.200]   It's so much cheaper than prison.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:43.040]   It's so much cheaper than him stealing cars or prostitute having to go to work.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.040]   That's sad.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.160]   You've lived one heck of a life.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:55.000]   Looking back, there's a lot of young people that listen to this, high school, college
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.080]   students.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.800]   What advice would you give them?
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:04.400]   How to live, how to have a successful career, how to have a good life, how to be a good
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.000]   man, a woman?
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.320]   To be a good man or woman, if I had it to do over with, I'll just tell you what I'd
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.320]   have done.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.640]   I would have paid attention and studied my lesson and did the best I could.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.640]   In school?
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.000]   In school, yes, and went as far as I could have.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.400]   I would have liked to have been a doctor.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.960]   I just didn't have the stickability or anybody to tell me, "Hey, go over there and do that."
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.000]   If you can do that at a very young age, start in a trade.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]   Learn to do something.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.320]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.880]   If you learn to do something good, there is a great demand for you.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.640]   I would say that in prison, the prison system should come in and you get a thief, young
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.640]   fans of thief, a robber.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.540]   You say, "All right, we need carpenters.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.540]   We need plumbers.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.540]   We need electricians.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.540]   We need sheep."
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:02.280]   Sentence them to that trade.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:06.480]   When you get an A plus in that, where you can go out and make you $30 or $50 an hour,
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   you go home.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.800]   Now, you can mess around 10 years if you want to, or you can do this in two.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.920]   I think that's just for the prison.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:22.640]   But anyway, I would say that they find somebody and be true to them, that we have just be
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:25.780]   honest and true in your life.
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:27.400]   You mean like relationships, friendships?
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.400]   Relationships, yes.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:36.280]   I mean, so many, so many people, particularly our children, are from relationships where
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   they're not wanted.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.280]   They're divorced.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   Their father's left.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.280]   They don't know who their daddy is.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.200]   They're distant foster homes.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:47.840]   Five hundred thousand children are in foster homes in America today.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.520]   Our government inadvertently isn't encouraging those people.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:57.000]   My daughter is a doctor, and she delivered a couple years ago a baby from a 10-year-old
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.440]   child.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:03.320]   That child, and she said in the visiting room, is four generations, all of them on welfare.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.480]   Now we got one more, and it reminds me of Elvis Presley's song, "In the Ghetto."
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:18.320]   So for an individual, learn a trade, become a craftsman of sorts, and find somebody to
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.880]   love and who loves you.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:20.880]   That's right.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.840]   Have a family and stick with it.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.160]   Surely, you're going to get angry.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.160]   You're going to get disappointed.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:33.440]   You're going to get all kinds of stuff, but come back and make up before you go to sleep.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.040]   Well, I did half of those things.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.040]   I got the first one.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.400]   I'm working on the second one, so I appreciate the advice.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:45.480]   Well, Mari, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.720]   Can you tell me the story of how you two met?
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.360]   Well, my parents every summer would go to the lake in Canada, and the place was called
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:01.840]   Turkey Point, which is on Lake Erie, and just have a nice summer holiday there, water skiing,
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.760]   swimming, sunbathing.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.800]   This was back in the '60s, and I was sitting on the pier with a few girlfriends and telling
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.800]   them my story.
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:17.160]   Then all of a sudden, I looked up and I saw this figure in the distance coming onto the
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.160]   pier.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.400]   Now, we're all dressed in bathing suits and swimwear, and we're swimming and this, that,
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.280]   and the other, and here he comes, dark trousers.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:36.000]   In fact, they were black, white shirt, and a tie, and a straw kind of a Panama hat.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.840]   So he stood out, and so I invited him to come and sit down.
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.120]   So he continued to talk, and we just talked and talked and talked, and then later moved
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.840]   to the beach.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:53.200]   I think the next time I saw him, he was talking to another girl, and I thought, "Yeah, you
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.200]   know, nah."
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   Yeah, men.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.200]   I know.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.200]   I was, "Okay, okay, next."
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:05.360]   Well, about six months later, I receive a letter, and it's a letter from Roger.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.000]   Then we start this lovely correspondence, and we just start writing.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.080]   In those days, you just wrote everything.
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.240]   And then the next summer, he was coming up again.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:22.520]   He was on his way to Alaska, and he says, "I would like to come by and see you."
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:26.360]   And I said, "Well, I'll be in the same place that I met you last year."
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:33.160]   And so when he came up this time, for some reason, Roger reached for my hand, and I reached
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.520]   for his, and man, that was it.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:40.320]   It was like love at first touch.
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.160]   It was just like a silence, and a, "Oh my gosh."
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.440]   We didn't even look at each other.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.240]   It was just, "Oh my goodness, what happened here?"
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.000]   And I was the type of person, I never wanted to get married, way, way, way down the road,
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:02.320]   never have any children, and I wanted to see the world first, and then do all that.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320]   But that was it.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.720]   That was love, and you've been together ever since.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:14.440]   The thing is about the love that the two of you have for each other is it had to persevere
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.080]   through quite a heck of a journey.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:27.320]   So how did Roger's drug smuggling change the nature of your love and your relationship?
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:32.240]   Well, Lex, that remained steadfast.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:34.440]   It endured.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:39.920]   And since Roger's been home, I think we've rekindled the love that we had when we first
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:42.400]   met.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:51.960]   But I think my faith, my steadfast faith, and also the fact that Roger and I communicated.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960]   We wrote letters.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960]   He never complained.
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.160]   I know there were the children there.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.760]   He never had mistreated me.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.760]   I love this guy.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.120]   And we had a lot of experiences.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.280]   It was just even though I-- He's good looking, charismatic.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280]   He's pretty, you know.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.280]   And he was adventurous, you know.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:11.280]   Adventurous.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:14.560]   Would you say that again?
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:22.320]   But yes, it was just, I know I missed him physically, but we were just so strong in
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.360]   spirit, you know, and we could talk to one another.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:38.400]   What was it like, Roger, when you're a free man seeing Mari for the first time in person
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:39.400]   again?
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.360]   I cried for three days.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.760]   Everything I'd look at a picture of her, I came home and there she prepared a meal for
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.320]   me.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:56.080]   And it was the old oak table that I'd redone and the chairs, the same one, and the green
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:01.400]   placemats and the same china that we had and the same silverware.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.600]   And it just, all of it just brought back the same paintings on the wall.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.080]   It was just like unbelievable.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:11.080]   After 35 years, she had all my clothes cleaned and my shoes shining.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.200]   And I put the shoes on and I walked out on the strings and the soles came off.
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.560]   But the shirts and all fit perfect and everything.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:19.960]   So it was just wonderful.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:24.560]   And just to see her and then just to think about, see her picture of her 50th birthday
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:28.280]   or her 60th birthday or her 70th birthday.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   I wasn't there.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.240]   And the picture of her and with the children, it just, it was heartbreaking.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.600]   And about the third day, I thought, man up, fella.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.400]   I mean, you've got to.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.200]   So I got over it and quit the tears.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:45.640]   But it was, everything was just pulsating with life.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.880]   It was just unbelievable to get out of that place.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.960]   It really was.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:49:01.400]   Is there, do you regret the drug smuggling that took you away from the woman you love?
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000]   100%.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:11.520]   Just, I wouldn't have done it again if, you don't think you're going to get caught.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.960]   And it's just, no, it's just, I did it for money and I had everything in the world I
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.360]   wanted before I did that.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:24.000]   So the adventure, I mean, it was one heck of an adventure for the two of you, for the
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000]   both of you.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]   Yes.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.040]   Were you able to enjoy it or was it always danger?
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.160]   Was it always something that threatened your relationship, your love, your family?
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.560]   Or were you able to enjoy the adventure of it?
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.280]   You know, we'll all die.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.640]   Life is short.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.560]   And to live that kind of adventure.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.440]   Well, whenever I did the first loot, I got $10,000.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:50.720]   And that was just about two years pay on the fire department take home.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.240]   And I brought that home and-
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.080]   I put my hand over my mouth.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.080]   I said, "Roger, I can't believe this."
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.760]   I had probably 20,000 money.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.880]   And Mari like, "Oh my, what in the world?"
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.560]   And Roger said, "Let's go have dinner."
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:08.200]   And so we went to the little restaurant that we would go to, you know, and he said, "And
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.440]   don't you dare look on the right hand side of the menu."
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.960]   He said, "Just order anything you want."
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.480]   And it was just as we were in the restaurant, you know, it was just we were giddy about
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.480]   it.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:24.120]   Yeah, I was giddy about it.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:30.480]   Were you afraid that, I mean, did you think about the fact that it's illegal and Roger
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.480]   can end up in prison?
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.280]   Oh, yes.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.680]   Did you guys talk about it?
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.600]   Well, I just, I kind of thought I was bulletproof.
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.040]   I mean, they didn't catch you.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.600]   I thought if they didn't catch you, you was all right.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.880]   And it was hard to get you.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:45.600]   Hard to catch you in the air.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.120]   You never thought, hard to catch you in the air.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.760]   I didn't know that if your friend told on you five years later, you'd still go to prison.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.760]   That was a problem.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.440]   I didn't know that.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.600]   Did you guys ever talk about walking away?
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.480]   I asked Roger to walk away.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.800]   He says, "I can't, Mario, just now."
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:13.600]   And then of course, the amount of people that he began to support, the family and the gifts
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.240]   and the deals.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.600]   The deals, yes, the deals.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:18.600]   Big ones.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:19.600]   Yes.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.640]   And then you always wanted to do, what do you do with the money?
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:29.320]   You know, so you want to, I guess you clean it up or you want to invest in an enterprise
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:31.120]   or in a business.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.160]   Well, it just doesn't work.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:37.720]   They know the source of it and they take it and run.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.720]   Every one of them.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.280]   And they're very generous, extremely generous and benevolent.
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.200]   And when I started, I would ask about it.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:53.920]   I went to a lawyer and a good number of people in California at that time wanted to legalize
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.440]   marijuana back in 1973.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:01.360]   And I went to a lawyer and I says, "Mr. Lawyer, I put $100 on the table.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:04.840]   What would they do if I caught me bringing marijuana across the border?"
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:06.720]   He said, "If you have a criminal record?"
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:09.600]   I said, "No, I've never had a speeding ticket.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.600]   Nothing.
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:12.120]   Not even a traffic ticket."
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.760]   He said, "You work for the fire department out in Los Angeles?"
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:16.760]   I said, "Yes, sir."
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.040]   He said, "You'll get probation.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:24.000]   The worst you'll do is you'll get one year and you'll spend four months raking leaves
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.920]   on a military base."
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:29.560]   So my mother and my father died some years before and I brought mother and baby sister
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.760]   came out and I took them down to Disneyland.
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.440]   And she said, "What you doing, boy?"
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.120]   I said, "I'm hauling pot, Ma."
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:36.120]   She said, "How much you making?"
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:40.240]   I said, "I'm making $40,000 any day I want to go."
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.520]   And she said, "What do they do if they catch you?"
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.720]   And I told her, "I brought the lawyer set.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.480]   Four months at the most, raking leaves.
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.480]   What do you think?"
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:48.840]   She said, "Do you need a co-pilot, son?"
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.040]   - Yeah, money is money.
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.040]   - Yeah.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:53:00.720]   - So your relationship persevered through some big challenges.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:06.320]   Is there advice you can give about what makes for a successful relationship?
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:15.560]   - Oh, well, you know, I think the initial igniting, meeting someone, you know, that's
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:17.480]   the love.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.480]   That's it.
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:23.880]   And that little fire, just that fire just keeps burning and burning and burning.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.520]   You can't put it out no matter what.
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:30.040]   It's the love fire.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.040]   - But it gets difficult.
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:32.040]   - It does.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.600]   - It's funny, the love fire.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.320]   So you're saying the love fire is all it takes to persevere through the difficulties.
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.320]   - Well, no.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.880]   Well, that's a huge part of it.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:50.240]   And also, I contribute my individual situation to, in order to endure the prison years, is
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.240]   my faith.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.600]   - Faith in God?
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.240]   - Yes.
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:54:00.480]   And friends who are unconditionally still love me no matter what.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.480]   Yes.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.160]   - So you had love around you in general.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.160]   - I did.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:13.400]   And my children, they, you know, and that was a real purpose to guide them and to love
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.400]   them and to help them become citizens.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:20.760]   - What about you, Roger?
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.680]   What advice would you give?
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.000]   - I just don't know how to do it.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.240]   I do know that you have to work on a relationship.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.880]   Laurie and I have had problems.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:28.880]   I mean, we get really-
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.880]   - You guys get in fights?
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:30.880]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.880]   - Oh, yes.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:32.880]   - Pretty regular.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.680]   But not, they don't let them last long.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:38.800]   But certainly, we are so different.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:41.400]   - We're the same and yet we're so different.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400]   - Like little stuff?
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.240]   - Little stuff, yes.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:50.360]   And it might be big, but I usually win her over.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:53.580]   But anyhow, I just feel like Maria was always there.
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:56.040]   It was like she was my anchor.
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.320]   I was coming home.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.600]   I was always coming home to her and the children.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.440]   And you can see throughout my life, I'm working on getting there.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.880]   - Are you afraid for his life, by the way?
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.880]   - Oh, yes.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:08.880]   There are times, yeah.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:11.480]   But I had faith in him.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.480]   He was an excellent pilot.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:18.160]   For example, I always said, "Roger, if the ship's going down, I'm jumping in the lifeboat
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.760]   with you because I know we're going to get to shore.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.000]   You will save us."
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]   And so I had that faith in him.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.960]   I mean, he's a man, but yet he's the one you want to get into the lifeboat with.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.120]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:37.840]   But then there is Pablo Escobar, one of the most dangerous humans in history, plus the
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:38.840]   US government.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.840]   - Yep.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:43.600]   - Worst by far.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:48.240]   - Very difficult to get away.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.240]   In terms of your faith, how has your faith helped you to be the woman you are in this
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.520]   relationship and seeing love the way you see it?
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.600]   - Well, I think my faith gives me hope.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.520]   I have lots of hope.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:09.520]   It helps me to dwell on the good side.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:17.280]   You know, whenever I meet someone and there's negative, I try to see why they are like that
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:19.680]   or what's the source of all that.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.480]   And I try to pull out the good.
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.560]   I really do.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:26.640]   Not that I'm a goody-goody, but that's what your faith does.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:31.600]   You know, you see them as God sees us.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.320]   - How has he changed over the years?
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.320]   - Roger?
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.320]   - Yeah.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.320]   - He's still the same.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:39.520]   Actually, I like him better now.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.520]   He's a little calmer.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.520]   - Yeah, he looks crazy.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.520]   - Oh, yes.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:49.640]   And happy to be at home where he'll say, "Mari, I am just so happy to be with you here in
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.920]   this condominium.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:51.920]   I'm content."
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.960]   Because I used to call him my homing pigeon.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.320]   I just have to let him fly.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.320]   I couldn't...
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.760]   No, he has to fly, but he always came home.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:06.520]   - Do you think about the end of this ride, our mortality?
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.280]   Do you think about your death?
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.280]   - I do.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:17.480]   Particularly, I'm going to have a heart valve replacement in about seven days where I could
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:18.480]   not make it.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.520]   It's a very serious operation, and I think about that very much.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:26.600]   And I ask for peace.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:33.960]   I just lost my brother about 10 days ago so unexpectedly, and that really makes you think
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.680]   of your mortality.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.160]   - Are you afraid?
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:42.320]   - Somewhat and yet not.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.200]   I want to live, Lex.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.360]   I want to live.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.600]   - This life is fun.
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.600]   - Yes.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.520]   - Do you think about your death, Roger?
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:53.520]   - I have visions.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:58:00.880]   I have visions, and they often happen very, very clear, like what I have seen in the future.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:05.240]   Scientists might call it wormholes, or in the Old Testament, they called it prophets.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:10.320]   But I see sometimes in the future around the corner, as clear as we're sitting right here.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.680]   - What's that look like?
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:14.960]   - I was on a porch, and I believe I was in Central America place.
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:21.440]   I was an old man with khaki pants and a white shirt, and it was a chair with wide arms,
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.440]   and it was straight, and there's like the beams coming out above my head, and I'm on
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.440]   the porch.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.440]   - Bougainvillea.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:33.440]   - And I have out-of-the-body experiences also.
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:39.560]   And I came out of my body, I just floated out of my body and went into a veil, and like
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:41.160]   into a mist.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.040]   And I believe that's probably why it happened.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:47.280]   - You talk about like it's in your past.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.280]   This is your future.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.600]   - No, this is in my future.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.200]   - This is something he has seen in the past.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.200]   - I've seen it in a vision.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.200]   - Yeah, in a vision.
[01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:59.680]   - No, I know, but it's funny, just the tense you use, it happened, and yet it's something
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680]   that will happen.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.680]   - Yes.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.160]   - To both are true.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.160]   - It's just unbelievable.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:07.560]   And I don't know how many people have it, but I have it.
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:11.320]   I walked out of my body just like, just where I could come up to you and look and set up
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:12.320]   on the radio.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:14.920]   I used to be at work on the railroad and I had one there.
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:15.920]   - How do you explain that?
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.920]   - I don't know, but--
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:20.480]   - What do you think, what the heck is going on in this universe that's possible?
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:25.480]   - Oh, I don't know, but certainly a phenomenon that happened.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:30.680]   And there's a guy, Bill Monroe, that wrote the book on out-of-the-body, he tells about
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.680]   it.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:35.160]   And who was the guy that writes The Alchemist?
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.560]   - Pablo Coelho.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.680]   - He has them also, just like that.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:45.240]   And he tells about how it happens on him, mine happened differently.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:48.280]   But you certainly can come out of your body.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:51.760]   - What do you think the meaning of this life is?
[01:59:51.760 --> 02:00:00.960]   Maybe from your faith, but also from just the amazing adventure that you lived through?
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:05.360]   How do you make sense of why the heck we're here?
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.480]   - I don't know.
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.160]   It's just kind of like who you are.
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:14.640]   Even when I was a child, I was like, "I'm different from other people."
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:15.640]   You know?
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:16.640]   And just as a boy, I was.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:23.080]   - Could you put into words how you were different or it was just the feeling?
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:27.400]   - Yeah, like my brother, I mean, he kept his hands clean and his shoes shining.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:32.760]   Here I was barefooted catching a wild hog or wrestling a horse trying to get it down.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.160]   - I saw pictures of you climbing a tree recently.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:40.760]   - Yes, when I first got out of prison, always something like that.
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:43.920]   So I don't know.
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.560]   And I noticed that something about me is sometimes in prison, there'd be a knife fight.
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:55.160]   And people just, you see them rough guys that turn white from it.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:56.880]   I just kind of almost like smile.
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:01.240]   I mean, unless they come at me, I'll turn white and get away.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:04.600]   But it doesn't bother, those things, it doesn't bother me.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   Prison didn't bother me.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.240]   - So you don't know what the heck the meaning is.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.440]   You just know you're a bit different than the others.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:14.440]   - Yeah, might be a little bit kooky.
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:21.520]   - Well, maybe the whole point is you wanna realize, you wanna let that madness flourish,
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.440]   that uniqueness flourish.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.440]   That's the whole point of life.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.480]   We're all different in our, in like very interesting little ways.
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.480]   - Yes.
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:33.040]   - And the more different you are, you wanna let that become, you wanna let it be its full
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.040]   possibility.
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:37.640]   - Like a garden, you know, all the different flowers.
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:42.560]   - You did mention, you weren't sure if there's a free will or not.
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:44.680]   Do you think it's all predetermined?
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:45.680]   Or do you think we make our own choices?
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:47.280]   - No, we definitely make our own decisions.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.640]   I just said if it is, I hope that.
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:51.640]   But I know that we make our own decisions.
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.800]   - Yes, I agree.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:57.480]   - And I know that we are spirits that are living in this flesh.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.880]   That's beyond a shadow of a doubt for me.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:03.360]   If you walk out of your body and have out of body experience, you will know it.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.560]   - So the body is just the temporary container for something much bigger.
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:09.560]   - The spirit lives on eternally with no beginning and no end.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.920]   And that's hard to fathom.
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:15.920]   This is just a little, this is a shell to contain that spirit.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.800]   You know, this is the way we work on earth, you know.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.880]   But yeah, I know, I'm an eternal being.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:22.880]   So are you.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.240]   - Do you think there's a why to it?
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:28.640]   You know, do you think there's a meaning to this life?
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:33.720]   - Well, I think the why is beyond my capability of understanding.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:36.040]   It's someone greater than me.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:38.560]   I don't understand it.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.240]   But it's awesome.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:42.520]   I just know that it's awesome.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.360]   And one day we will know the answers.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:50.480]   Once we get to that crossover to the other side, I think we will understand clearly.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.800]   It says, you know, now we see through a glass darkly.
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.560]   But then when we are face to face with God, we will understand.
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:04.320]   And until we know, let's just enjoy this beautiful life while we got it.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.320]   - Yes, absolutely.
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:06.320]   - And we're meant to.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.320]   - That was my gift.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.680]   I love everybody and everything.
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.680]   I do.
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:14.400]   And it just, and I'm sorry if I put a stumbling block in anybody's way.
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.200]   I wouldn't want to.
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:22.720]   But these are these things that I just think about, oh, what a hypocritical world we live
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.920]   in though.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.880]   Like most anybody, I'd say, listen, okay, he's a drug dealer.
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:31.440]   And I would say most of them are committed adultery.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:32.440]   That's a cardinal sin.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:40.720]   And yet they move, throw rocks at me for moving marijuana or cocaine across the road.
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.560]   It's just if you saw the two different things, you'd say, what a terrible difference it is.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:51.320]   But we've become conditioned with this mad society that we have.
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:56.080]   - You mentioned that your daughter, Miriam, wrote you a poem.
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:57.080]   You mind reading it?
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.240]   - I'd be glad to.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:05.400]   I was doing 11 years up in Lombok Penitentiary, maximum security prison for parole violation
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:09.000]   for possession of marijuana in 1977.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.960]   They should have given me six months, but they gave me 11 years because they wanted
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:14.320]   me for what they call silent beef.
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:20.360]   Anyhow, while I was in that dungeon, I received a letter from my daughter, Miriam.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:23.080]   It's called "Daddy's Poem."
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.640]   A year ago, I became a poet when I wrote your birthday prose.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:30.480]   And here I am today ready to give it another go.
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:37.160]   First, I would like to wish you a very happy birthday to be, and to thank you so very much,
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:39.600]   for without you, I would not be me.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.000]   Secondly, I want to say that your support has been immense.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000]   It has been true, honest, loving, and free of all pretense.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:54.200]   Thirdly, it goes without saying, your love has surpassed all my wrongs, and you always
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.960]   made me smile with one of your old country songs.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:03.960]   I can remember on Quervo, Daddy, with you holding me in your arms as you sang Jim Reeve
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:06.520]   songs and talked about the farm.
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:10.840]   I can see you walking through the door from one of your travels far and wide, and the
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:15.040]   thought of you coming home, Daddy, kept a twinkle in our eyes.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.080]   I can smell you as I did when I used to climb into your bed, and you would talk to me again
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:22.760]   about one of the adventures that you led.
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:28.100]   I can see me and Mario asleep in one of your airplanes extraordinaire, and remembering
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:31.840]   wondering to myself why there wasn't an available chair.
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:36.520]   I remember having to meet you and worrying that you wouldn't be there, but you would
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:41.840]   pop from behind some counter and give us all a happy scare.
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:47.560]   You gave us presents in Key Biscayne, in hotels Pleasure Galore, and three dozen roses as
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:50.120]   we came through the airport door.
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:54.440]   I can see your face in Amsterdam with the luggage carousel, and you look like a boy
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:57.960]   with a secret that you were just dying to tell.
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:02.800]   You taught me mathematics in the sands of faraway places, and taught me to sail, and
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:05.040]   we left without any traces.
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:09.920]   We climbed glaciers in Argentina and saw the blue of the beautiful caves and witnessed
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:14.160]   the majestic beauty of such a jaggling maze.
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:17.680]   I learned how to change gears on the dirt roads of Brazil.
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:22.040]   We ate hot dogs in Paraguay, a memory we smile over still.
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:27.360]   We talked about lions, elephants, and bears on the Hacienda in Uruguay, but decided it
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.560]   was better if to Europe we did fly.
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:34.760]   Oh, the old world and all its luxury, what a good time it was.
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:39.240]   From South America to the Krasnopolsky, I think we fell in love.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:45.200]   The European jaunt, well, it is considered a book in itself, but it's a story about
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:48.720]   beauty and knowledge, suspense, and worldly wealth.
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:52.960]   We went from Holland to Sweden, and we went from France to Spain, and I promise you I
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.600]   have no regrets.
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:57.360]   I would definitely do it all again.
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.440]   I would see the world with you anytime, sir.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:05.200]   There's no doubt in my mind, because being by your side, Daddy, always ensures a wild
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.200]   good time.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:11.120]   So, our paths took a turn, and we're back in the U.S. of A, but life here isn't so
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:14.400]   bad and I'm plump content to stay.
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:19.480]   I'm happy to be near you, although I'm not as close as I was before, but because of your
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:23.600]   love and encouragement, I've been able to open new doors.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:29.320]   I'm grateful to be in school, and I'm generally happy where I am, and I even like when you
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:32.960]   call and tell me to study for the next exam.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.960]   What a life you've given me, Daddy.
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:37.800]   It's a tremendous and a magical gift.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:40.120]   We already have so many stories to tell.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:42.400]   There are far too many to list.
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:47.480]   But I want to thank you again this day with a very big happy birthday to you, and to tell
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:51.080]   you just a few more things that I knew in my heart to be true.
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:56.120]   That I love you, Daddy, with all of your wrongs and your rights, that you're a head of our
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:01.240]   family and you've kept us all bound tight, that you have an honest love in your heart
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:06.400]   for God and all mankind, and you truly do believe in yourself when you say it will all
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.280]   be fine.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:13.760]   I know you will be there to catch me if ever I waver or slip, and I know I'd want you as
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:16.040]   captain on any sinking ship.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:19.120]   I also know a new chapter is written.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.740]   It's almost time to move on.
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:25.080]   It's time to sail another sea and to witness a brand new dawn.
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:30.400]   It'll be good to see you at the helm again as you point out our destination, the laughing
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.920]   dance on the upper deckers while the boat glides through.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:40.280]   It'll be good to see you on the go, as I know you like to be, and to know you can open any
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:43.520]   door without any key.
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.440]   But while we revel in our days together, we will know better than to hurry, because as
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:53.240]   you told me many times, life is an incredible journey.
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:56.720]   - Wow, that's beautiful.
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:58.520]   - Yeah.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:05.560]   - Roger, I'm really honored that you would take the time to visit me in Texas and to
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.560]   sit down and talk with me.
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:07.560]   Thank you so much, Roger.
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:08.560]   - Thank you.
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:09.560]   - Thanks so much, Mark.
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:10.560]   - Thank you, it was a pleasure.
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:11.560]   - It's been a real pleasure.
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.560]   - Yes.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.560]   - Beautiful.
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:18.440]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Roger Reeves, and thank you to Noom,
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:23.360]   Allform, ExpressVPN, Four Sigmatic, and Eight Sleep.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:27.000]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.440]   And now let me leave you with some words from Pablo Escobar.
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:36.800]   All empires are created of blood and fire.
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:37.800]   Thank you for listening.
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.000]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000]   - Bye.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:40.000]   - Bye.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]   You
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000]   You
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:54.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
