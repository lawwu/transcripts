[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   - Let's try to go to the very simplest question
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.040]   that you've answered many a time,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.500]   but perhaps the simplest things can help us reveal,
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.600]   even in time, some new ideas.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.560]   So what, in your view, is consciousness?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.760]   What is qualia?
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.640]   What is the hard problem of consciousness?
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.300]   - Consciousness, I mean, the word is used many ways,
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.180]   but the kind of consciousness that I'm interested in
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960]   is basically subjective experience.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340]   What it feels like from the inside to be a human being
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100]   or any other conscious being.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.960]   I mean, there's something it's like to be me.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.460]   Right now, I have visual images that I'm experiencing.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.560]   I'm hearing my voice.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.100]   I've got maybe some emotional tone.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.620]   I've got a stream of thoughts running through my head.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.580]   These are all things that I experience
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.200]   from the first person point of view.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.100]   I've sometimes called this the inner movie in the mind.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.560]   It's not a perfect metaphor.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.180]   It's not like a movie in every way,
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.620]   and it's very rich.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.340]   But yeah, it's just direct, subjective experience.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.320]   And I call that consciousness,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.560]   or sometimes philosophers use the word qualia,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.420]   which you suggested.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.000]   People tend to use the word qualia
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.380]   for things like the qualities of things like colors,
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.220]   redness, the experience of redness
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.620]   versus the experience of greenness,
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.780]   the experience of one taste or one smell versus another,
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.900]   the experience of the quality of pain.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.660]   And yeah, a lot of consciousness
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.980]   is the experience of those qualities.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.220]   - Well, consciousness is bigger,
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.020]   the entirety of any kinds of experience.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.860]   - Consciousness of thinking is not obviously qualia.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.420]   It's not like specific qualities like redness or greenness.
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.180]   But still, I'm thinking about my hometown.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.660]   I'm thinking about what I'm gonna do later on.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.140]   Maybe there's still something running through my head,
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.300]   which is subjective experience.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.940]   Maybe it goes beyond those qualities or qualia.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.260]   Philosophers sometimes use the word
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.660]   phenomenal consciousness for consciousness in this sense.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.460]   I mean, people also talk about access consciousness,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.260]   being able to access information in your mind,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.020]   reflective consciousness,
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.900]   being able to think about yourself.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   But it looks like the really mysterious one,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.180]   the one that really gets people going
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.820]   is phenomenal consciousness.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.540]   The fact that all this,
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.660]   the fact that there's subjective experience
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.060]   and all this feels like something at all.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.820]   And then the hard problem is, how is it that,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.460]   why is it that there is phenomenal consciousness at all?
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.540]   And how is it that physical processes in a brain
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.340]   could give you subjective experience?
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.620]   It looks like on the face of it,
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.860]   you'd have all this big, complicated physical system
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.900]   in a brain running
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.420]   without it giving subjective experience at all.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.740]   And yet we do have subjective experience.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.180]   So the hard problem is just explain that.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.900]   - Explain how that comes about.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.500]   We haven't been able to build machines
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.260]   where a red light goes on that says it's not conscious.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.660]   So how do we actually create that?
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300]   Or how do humans do it?
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.860]   And how do we ourselves do it?
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.660]   - We do every now and then create machines that can do this.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.540]   We create babies that are conscious.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.500]   They've got these brains.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.340]   - As best as we can tell.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.380]   - And that does produce consciousness.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.620]   But even though we can create it,
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.820]   we still don't understand why it happens.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.380]   Maybe eventually we'll be able to create machines,
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.780]   which as a matter of fact, AI machines,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.220]   which as a matter of fact are conscious.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.700]   But that won't necessarily make the hard problem go away
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.420]   any more than it does with babies.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.420]   'Cause we still wanna know how and why is it
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.420]   that these processes give you consciousness?
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.100]   - You know, you just made me realize for a second,
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.180]   maybe it's a totally dumb realization,
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.780]   but nevertheless, that it's a useful way to think about
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.660]   the creation of consciousness is looking at a baby.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.460]   So that there's a certain point
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.840]   at which that baby is not conscious.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.060]   The baby starts from maybe, I don't know,
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.500]   from a few cells, right?
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.700]   There's a certain point at which it becomes,
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.860]   consciousness arrives, it's conscious.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.820]   Of course we can't know exactly that line,
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.960]   but it's a useful idea that we do create consciousness.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.500]   Again, a really dumb thing for me to say,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.940]   but not until now did I realize
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.580]   we do engineer consciousness.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.180]   We get to watch the process happen.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.140]   We don't know which point it happens or where it is,
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.140]   but we do see the birth of consciousness.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.020]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a question of course,
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.940]   is whether babies are conscious when they're born.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.260]   And it used to be, it seems,
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.180]   at least some people thought they weren't,
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.460]   which is why they didn't give anesthetics
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.100]   to newborn babies when they circumcised them.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.540]   And so now people think, oh, that's incredibly cruel.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.700]   Of course babies feel pain.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.060]   And now the dominant view is that babies can feel pain.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.180]   Actually, my partner, Claudia,
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.440]   works on this whole issue of whether there's consciousness
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.620]   in babies and of what kind.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.100]   And she certainly thinks that newborn babies
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.420]   can come into the world with some degree of consciousness.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.820]   Of course, then you can just extend the question
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.060]   backwards to fetuses,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.460]   and suddenly you're into politically controversial--
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.100]   - Exactly. - Territory.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.820]   But the question also arises in the animal kingdom.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.600]   Where does consciousness start or stop?
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.100]   Is there a line in the animal kingdom
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.680]   where the first conscious organisms are?
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.880]   It's interesting, over time,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.220]   people are becoming more and more liberal
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.060]   about ascribing consciousness to animals.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.340]   People used to think,
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.500]   maybe only mammals could be conscious.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.400]   Now most people seem to think, sure, fish are conscious.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.740]   They can feel pain.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.940]   And now we're arguing over insects.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.180]   You'll find people out there who say,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.580]   plants have some degree of consciousness.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.820]   So who knows where it's gonna end?
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.340]   The far end of this chain is the view
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.180]   that every physical system
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.300]   has some degree of consciousness.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.540]   Philosophers call that panpsychism.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.300]   I take that view.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.920]   - I mean, that's a fascinating way to view reality.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.820]   So if you could talk about,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.500]   if you can linger on panpsychism for a little bit,
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.380]   what does it mean?
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.940]   So it's not just plants are conscious.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.460]   I mean, it's that consciousness
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.340]   is a fundamental fabric of reality.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.340]   What does that mean to you?
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.620]   How are we supposed to think about that?
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.880]   - Well, we're used to the idea
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.620]   that some things in the world are fundamental, right?
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.460]   In physics. - Like what?
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.760]   - We take things like space or time or space-time,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.060]   mass, charge as fundamental properties of the universe.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.380]   You don't reduce them to something simpler.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.880]   You take those for granted.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.060]   You've got some laws that connect them.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.740]   Here is how mass and space and time evolve.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.540]   Theories like relativity or quantum mechanics
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.900]   or some future theory that will unify them both.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.460]   But everyone says you gotta take some things as fundamental.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.540]   And if you can't explain one thing
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.060]   in terms of the previous fundamental things,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.220]   you have to expand.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.600]   Maybe something like this happened with Maxwell.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.140]   He ended up with fundamental principles
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.460]   of electromagnetism and took charge as fundamental
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.060]   'cause it turned out that was the best way to explain it.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.800]   So I at least take seriously the possibility
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.040]   something like that could happen with consciousness.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.080]   Take it as a fundamental property like space, time, and mass
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.100]   and instead of trying to explain consciousness
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.980]   wholly in terms of the evolution of space, time,
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.980]   and mass and so on, take it as a primitive
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   and then connect it to everything else
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.700]   by some fundamental laws.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.580]   There's this basic problem that the physics we have now
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.820]   looks great for solving the easy problems of consciousness
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.260]   which are all about behavior.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.460]   They give us a complicated structure and dynamics.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.620]   They tell us how things are gonna behave,
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.140]   what kind of observable behavior they'll produce
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.380]   which is great for the problems of explaining how we walk
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.540]   and how we talk and so on.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.580]   Those are the easy problems of consciousness
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.500]   but the hard problem was this problem
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.300]   about subjective experience just doesn't look
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.540]   like that kind of problem about structure, dynamics,
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.740]   how things behave.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.260]   So it's hard to see how existing physics
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.620]   is gonna give you a full explanation of that.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.940]   - Certainly trying to get a physics view of consciousness,
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.900]   yes, there has to be a connecting point
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.540]   and it could be at the very axiomatic,
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.060]   at the very beginning level.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.100]   But I mean, first of all,
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.100]   there's a crazy idea that sort of everything
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.700]   has properties of consciousness.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.040]   At that point, the word consciousness
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.940]   is already beyond the reach of our current understanding,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.740]   like far because it's so far from,
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.700]   at least for me, maybe you can correct me,
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.940]   as far from the experience and the experiences
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.220]   that we have, that I have as a human being.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.420]   To say that everything is conscious,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.420]   that means that basically another way to put that,
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.780]   if that's true, then we understand almost nothing
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.060]   about that fundamental aspect of the world.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.700]   - How do you feel about saying an ant is conscious?
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.980]   Do you get the same reaction to that
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.700]   or is that something you can understand?
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.140]   - I can understand ant, I can't understand an atom.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.340]   - A plant? - A particle.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.620]   Plant, so I'm comfortable with living things on Earth
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.740]   being conscious because there's some kind of agency
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.140]   where they're similar size to me
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.740]   and they can be born and they can die
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.340]   and that is understandable intuitively.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.660]   Of course, you anthropomorphize,
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.940]   you put yourself in the place of the plant.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.180]   But I can understand it.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.540]   I mean, I'm not like, I don't believe actually
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.580]   that plants are conscious or that plants suffer,
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.820]   but I can understand that kind of belief,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.900]   that kind of idea.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.900]   - How do you feel about robots?
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.700]   Like the kind of robots we have now?
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.820]   If I told you like that a Roomba
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.420]   had some degree of consciousness
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:27.060]   or some deep neural network?
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.380]   - I could understand that a Roomba has consciousness.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.580]   I just had spent all day at iRobot.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.140]   And I mean, I personally love robots
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.900]   and have a deep connection with robots.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.980]   So I can, I also probably anthropomorphize them.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.820]   There's something about the physical object.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.740]   So there's a difference than a neural network,
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.900]   a neural network running a software.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.980]   To me, the physical object,
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.620]   something about the human experience
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.900]   allows me to really see that physical object as an entity.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.860]   And if it moves and moves in a way that it,
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.380]   there's a, like I didn't program it,
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:10.340]   where it feels that it's acting based on its own perception
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.380]   and yes, self-awareness and consciousness,
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.400]   even if it's a Roomba,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   then you start to assign it some agency, some consciousness.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.740]   So, but to say that panpsychism,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.820]   that consciousness is a fundamental property of reality
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.300]   is a much bigger statement.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.540]   That it's like turtles all the way.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.020]   It's like every, it doesn't end.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.300]   The whole thing is, so like how,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.060]   I know it's full of mystery,
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.940]   but if you can linger on it, like how would it,
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.540]   how do you think about reality
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.800]   if consciousness is a fundamental part of its fabric?
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.220]   - The way you get there is from thinking,
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.660]   can we explain consciousness
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.460]   given the existing fundamentals?
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.060]   And then if you can't, as at least right now it looks like,
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.240]   then you've got to add something.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.860]   It doesn't follow that you have to add consciousness.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.940]   Here's another interesting possibility is,
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.940]   well, we'll add something else.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.580]   Let's call it proto-consciousness or X.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.060]   And then it turns out space, time, mass, plus X
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.860]   will somehow collectively give you the possibility
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.140]   for consciousness.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.700]   Why don't rule out that view?
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.700]   Either I call that pan-proto-psychism
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.180]   'cause maybe there's some other property,
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.820]   proto-consciousness at the bottom level.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.980]   And if you can't imagine
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.740]   there's actually genuine consciousness at the bottom level,
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.040]   I think we should be open to the idea
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.100]   there's this other thing X.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.900]   Maybe we can't imagine that somehow gives you consciousness.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.300]   But if we are playing along with the idea
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.260]   that there really is genuine consciousness
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.300]   at the bottom level, of course,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.220]   this is going to be way out and speculative,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.980]   but at least in, say, if it was classical physics,
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.220]   then you'd end up saying, well, every little atom,
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.580]   with a bunch of particles in space-time,
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.480]   each of these particles has some kind of consciousness
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.500]   whose structure mirrors maybe their physical properties,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.020]   like its mass, its charge, its velocity, and so on.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.240]   The structure of its consciousness
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.220]   would roughly correspond to that.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.780]   And the physical interactions between particles.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.180]   There's this old worry about physics.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.060]   I mentioned this before
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.060]   in this issue about the manifest image.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.020]   We don't really find out
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.500]   about the intrinsic nature of things.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.380]   Physics tells us about how a particle relates
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.260]   to other particles and interacts.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.780]   It doesn't tell us about what the particle is in itself.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.540]   That was Kant's thing in itself.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.660]   So here's a view.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.780]   The nature in itself of a particle is something mental.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.420]   A particle is actually a little conscious subject
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.260]   with properties of its consciousness
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.060]   that correspond to its physical properties.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.540]   The laws of physics are actually ultimately relating
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.460]   these properties of conscious subjects.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.580]   So in this view, a Newtonian world
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.100]   actually would be a vast collection
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.140]   of little conscious subjects at the bottom level,
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.860]   way, way simpler than we are without free will
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.180]   or rationality or anything like that.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.700]   But that's what the universe would be like.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.260]   Now, of course, that's a vastly speculative view.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.520]   No particular reason to think it's correct.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.380]   Furthermore, non-Newtonian physics,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.860]   say quantum mechanical wave function,
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.020]   suddenly it starts to look different.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.500]   It's not a vast collection of conscious subjects.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.260]   Maybe there's ultimately one big wave function
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.580]   for the whole universe corresponding to that.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.180]   Might be something more like a single conscious mind
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.040]   whose structure corresponds to the structure
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.180]   of the wave function.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.060]   People sometimes call this cosmopsychism.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.780]   And now, of course, we're in the realm
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.100]   of extremely speculative philosophy.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.080]   There's no direct evidence for this.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.240]   But yeah, but if you want a picture
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.220]   of what that universe would be like,
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.620]   think yeah, giant cosmic mind with enough richness
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.420]   and structure among it to replicate
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.460]   all the structure of physics.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.640]   - I think therefore I am at the level of particles
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.420]   and with quantum mechanics at the level
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.520]   of the wave function.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.720]   It's kind of an exciting, beautiful possibility,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.880]   of course, way out of reach of physics currently.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.980]   It is interesting that some neuroscientists
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.620]   are beginning to take panpsychism seriously.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.800]   You find consciousness even in very simple systems.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.500]   So for example, the integrated information theory
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.300]   of consciousness, a lot of neuroscientists
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.140]   are taking it seriously.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.940]   Actually, I just got this new book by Christoph Koch
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.620]   just came in, "The Feeling of Life Itself,"
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.140]   why consciousness is widespread but can't be computed.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.460]   He basically endorses a panpsychist view
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.760]   where you get consciousness with the degree
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.580]   of information processing or integrated information
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.460]   processing in a system and even very, very simple systems
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.680]   like a couple of particles will have some degree of this.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.180]   So he ends up with some degree of consciousness
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.620]   in all matter and the claim is that this theory
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   can actually explain a bunch of stuff
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.520]   about the connection between the brain and consciousness.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.280]   Now that's very controversial.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.840]   I think it's very, very early days
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.940]   in the science of consciousness.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.780]   - But it's interesting that it's not just philosophy
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.620]   that might lead you in this direction
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.220]   but there are ways of thinking quasi-scientifically
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.420]   that lead you there too.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.140]   - But maybe it's different than panpsychism.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.980]   What do you think?
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.820]   So Alan Watts has this quote that I'd like to ask you about.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.300]   The quote is, "Through our eyes,
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.640]   "the universe is perceiving itself.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.500]   "Through our ears, the universe is listening
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.960]   "to its harmonies.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.900]   "We are the witnesses to which the universe
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.460]   "becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence."
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.740]   So that's not panpsychism.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.740]   Do you think that we are essentially the tools,
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.420]   the senses the universe created to be conscious of itself?
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.540]   - It's an interesting idea.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.500]   Of course, if you went for the giant cosmic mind view
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.340]   then the universe was conscious all along.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.180]   It didn't need us.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.200]   We were just little components
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.120]   of the universal consciousness.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.760]   Likewise, if you believe in panpsychism
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.800]   then there was some little degree of consciousness
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.640]   at the bottom level all along
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.240]   and we were just a more complex form of consciousness.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.020]   So I think maybe the quote you mentioned works better.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.080]   If you're not a panpsychist, you're not a cosmopsychist,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.160]   you think consciousness just exists
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.280]   at this intermediate level.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.260]   And of course, that's the orthodox view.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.600]   - That, you would say, is the common view?
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   So is your own view of panpsychism a rarer view?
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.080]   - I think it's generally regarded, certainly,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.400]   as a speculative view held by a fairly small minority
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.720]   of at least theorists, philosophers,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.160]   most philosophers and most scientists
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.560]   who think about consciousness are not panpsychists.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.160]   There's been a bit of a movement in that direction
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.840]   the last 10 years or so.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.920]   It seems to be quite popular,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.520]   especially among the younger generation,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.880]   but it's still very definitely a minority view.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.060]   Many people think it's totally bat shit crazy
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.260]   to use the technical term.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.240]   (laughing)
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.080]   - It's a philosophical term.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.760]   - Yeah, so the orthodox view, I think, is still
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.100]   consciousness is something that humans have
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.960]   and some good number of non-human animals have
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.660]   and maybe AIs might have one day, but it's restricted.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.360]   On that view, then there was no consciousness
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.160]   at the start of the universe, there may be none at the end,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.860]   but it is this thing which happened at some point
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.120]   in the history of the universe, consciousness developed.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.400]   And yes, that's a very amazing event on this view
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.520]   because many people are inclined to think
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.120]   consciousness is what somehow gives meaning to our lives.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.680]   Without consciousness, there'd be no meaning,
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   no true value, no good versus bad, and so on.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.120]   So with the advent of consciousness,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.920]   suddenly the universe went from meaningless
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.680]   to somehow meaningful.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.760]   Why did this happen?
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.120]   I guess the quote you mentioned was somehow,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.280]   this was somehow destined to happen
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.760]   because the universe needed to have consciousness within it
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.040]   to have value and have meaning, and maybe you could combine
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.560]   that with a theistic view or a teleological view.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.360]   The universe was inexorably evolving towards consciousness.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   Actually, my colleague here at NYU, Tom Nagel,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.160]   wrote a book called "Mind and Cosmos" a few years ago
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.000]   where he argued for this teleological view
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.960]   of evolution toward consciousness,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.560]   saying this led to problems for Darwinism.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.040]   It's got him on, you know, this was very, very controversial.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.560]   Most people didn't agree.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.000]   I don't myself agree with this teleological view,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   but it is at least a beautiful speculative view
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.760]   of the cosmos.
