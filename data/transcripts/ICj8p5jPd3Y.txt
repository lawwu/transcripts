[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   The following is a conversation with Matthew Johnson,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.600]   a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.920]   at Johns Hopkins, and is one of the top scientists
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.360]   in the world conducting seminal research on psychedelics.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.760]   This was one of the most eye-opening
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.880]   and fascinating conversations I've ever had on this podcast.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.540]   I'm sure I'll talk with Matt many more times.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.920]   Quick match interview sponsor,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.640]   followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   Thank you to a new sponsor, Brave,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.280]   a fast browser that feels like Chrome,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.440]   but has more privacy-preserving features.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.060]   Neuro, the maker of functional sugar-free gum and mints
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.680]   that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.800]   Four Sigmatic, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800]   I'm just now realizing how ironic the set of sponsors are.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.760]   And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.960]   Please check out these sponsors in the description

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.640]   As a side note, let me say that psychedelics
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760]   is an area of study that is fascinating to me,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240]   in that it gives hints that much of the magic
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.680]   of our experience arises from just a few
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.720]   chemical interactions in the brain,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.120]   and that the nature of that experience can be expanded
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.680]   through the tools of biology, chemistry, physics,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.360]   neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.200]   The fact that a world-class scientist and researcher
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.840]   like Matt can apply rigor to our study
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.720]   of this mysterious and fascinating topic
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.240]   is exciting to me beyond words,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.480]   as is the case with any of my colleagues
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.920]   who dare to venture out into the darkness
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.700]   of all that is unknown about the human mind,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.960]   with both an openness of first-principle thinking
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920]   and the rigor of the scientific method.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.020]   And now, here's my conversation with Matthew Johnson.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.960]   Can you give an introduction to psychedelics,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.800]   like a whirlwind overview?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.720]   Maybe what are psychedelics,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.560]   and what are the kinds of psychedelics out there,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.600]   and in whatever way you find meaningful to categorize.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.200]   - Yeah, you can categorize them
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   by their chemical structure.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.520]   So phenethylamines, tryptamines, ergalines.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.920]   That is less of a meaningful way to classify them.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.720]   I think that their pharmacological activity,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.380]   their receptor activity is the best way.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.960]   Well, let me start even broader than that,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.680]   because there I'm talking about the classic psychedelics.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.960]   So broadly speaking, when we say psychedelic,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.280]   that refers to, for most people,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   a broad number of compounds
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.000]   that work in different pharmacological ways.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.260]   So it includes the so-called classic psychedelics.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.080]   That includes psilocybin and psilocin,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   which are in mushrooms, LSD, dimethyltryptamine, or DMT,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.880]   it's in ayahuasca, people can smoke it too,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.620]   mescaline, which is in peyote and San Pedro, cactus.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.660]   And those all work by hitting
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.500]   a certain subtype of serotonin receptor,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.540]   the serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.240]   They act as agonists at that receptor.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.600]   Other compounds like PCP, ketamine, MDMA, ibogaine,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.100]   they all are, more broadly speaking, called psychedelics,
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.100]   but they work by very different ways pharmacologically.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.220]   And they have some different effects,
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.700]   including some subjective effects,
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.180]   even though there's enough of an overlap
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.300]   in the subjective effects
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.180]   that people informally refer to them as psychedelic.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.340]   And I think what that overlap is,
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.340]   compared to say caffeine and cocaine and Ambien, et cetera,
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.700]   other psychoactive drugs,
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.420]   is that they have strong effects
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.980]   in altering one's sense of reality
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.060]   and including the sense of self.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.700]   And I should throw in there that cannabis,
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.460]   more historically, like in the '70s,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.060]   has been called a minor psychedelic.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.780]   And I think with that latter definition,
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.100]   it does fit that definition,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.500]   particularly if one doesn't have a tolerance.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.300]   - So you mentioned serotonin,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   so most of the effect comes from something around
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.020]   like the chemistry around neurotransmitters and so on.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.820]   So it's chemical interactions in the brain,
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.660]   or is there other kinds of interactions
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.920]   that have this kind of perception
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.340]   and self-awareness-altering effects?
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.580]   - Well, as far as we know,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.020]   all of the psychedelics of all the different classes
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.820]   we've talked about,
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.700]   their major activity is caused by receptor-level events.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.700]   So either acting at the post-receptor side of the synapse,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.260]   so in other words, neurotransmission operates
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.260]   by one neuron releasing neurotransmitter into a synapse,
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.280]   a gap between the two neurons,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.140]   and then the other neuron receives.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.700]   It has receptors that receives,
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.640]   and then there can be an activation caused by that.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.260]   So it's like a pitcher and a catcher.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.700]   So all of the major psychedelics
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.700]   work by either mimicking a pitcher or a catcher.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.420]   So for example, the classic psychedelics,
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.420]   they fit into the same catcher's mitt
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.420]   on the post-synaptic receptor side as serotonin itself,
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.560]   but they do a slightly different thing to the cell,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.420]   to the neuron, than serotonin does.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.260]   There's a different signaling pathway
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.460]   after that initial activation.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.900]   Something like MDMA works at the presynaptic side,
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.820]   the pitcher side, and basically it floods the synapse
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.060]   or the gap between the cells with a bunch of serotonin,
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.260]   the natural neurotransmitter.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.300]   So it's like the pitcher in a baseball game
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.420]   all of a sudden just starts throwing balls every second.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.420]   - Everything we're talking about,
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.820]   is it often more natural,
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.740]   meaning found in the natural world?
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.060]   You mentioned cacti, cactus,
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.260]   or is it chemically manufactured,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.580]   like artificially in the lab?
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.580]   - So the classic psychedelics, there's--
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.820]   - What are the classics?
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.420]   So using terminology that's not chemical terminology,
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.260]   not like the terminology you see in titles of papers,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.220]   academic papers, but more sort of common parlance.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.620]   - Right, it would be good to kind of define their effects,
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.900]   like how they're different.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.580]   And so it includes LSD, psilocybin,
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.780]   which is in mushrooms, mescaline, DMT.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.940]   - Which one is mescaline?
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.220]   - Mescaline is in the different cacti,
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.340]   so the one most people will know is peyote,
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.980]   but it also shows up in San Pedro or Peruvian torch.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.360]   And all of these classic psychedelics,
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.300]   they have at the right dose,
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.700]   and typically they have very strong effects
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.420]   on one's sense of reality and one's sense of self.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.500]   Some of the things that makes them different
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.380]   than other more broadly speaking psychedelics
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.860]   like MDMA and others is that they're,
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.780]   at least the major examples,
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.460]   there are some exotic ones that differ,
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.140]   but the ones I've talked about are extremely safe
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.160]   at the physiological level.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.020]   Like there's LSD and psilocybin,
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.180]   there's no known lethal overdose,
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.420]   unless you have really severe heart disease,
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.180]   'cause it modestly raises your blood pressure.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.820]   So same person that might be hurt shoveling snow
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.820]   or going up the stairs, that could have a cardiac event
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.060]   because they've taken one of these drugs.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.740]   But for most people, someone could take 1,000 times
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.840]   what the effective dose is,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.500]   and it's not gonna cause any organ damage,
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.420]   affect the brainstem, make them stop breathing.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.060]   So in that sense, they're freakishly safe at the,
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.020]   I would never call any compounds safe
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.620]   'cause there's always a risk.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.220]   They're freakishly safe at the physiological level.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.700]   I mean, you can hardly find anything over the counter,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.220]   like that, I mean, aspirin's not like that,
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.060]   caffeine is not like that.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.060]   Most drugs, you take five, 10, 20, maybe it takes 100,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.060]   but you get to some times the effective dose,
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.660]   and it's gonna kill you or cause some serious damage.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.060]   And so that's something that's remarkable
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.820]   about most of these classic psychedelics.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.980]   - That's incredible, by the way,
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.400]   that you can go on a hell of a journey in the mind,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.540]   like probably transformative,
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.700]   potentially in a deeply transformative way,
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.100]   and yet there's no dose that in most people
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.500]   would have a lethal effect.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.700]   That's kind of fascinating.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.780]   There's this duality between the mind and the body.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.980]   It's like, it's the, okay,
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.420]   sorry if I bring him up way too much,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.020]   but David Goggins is like,
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.060]   you know, the kind of things you go on on the long run,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.700]   like the hell you might go through in your mind.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.940]   Your mind can take a lot,
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.900]   and you can go through a lot with the mind,
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.100]   and the body will just be its own thing.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.020]   You can go through hell, but after a good night's sleep,
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.580]   be back to normal, and the body is always there.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.860]   - So bringing it back to Goggins,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.940]   it's like you can do that
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.620]   without even destroying your knee or whatever.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.460]   - Right, well, yes.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.980]   - Or coming close and riding that line.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.820]   - That's true.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.340]   So the unfortunate thing about the running,
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.980]   which he uses running to test the mind,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.100]   so the aspect of running that is negative,
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.220]   in order to test the mind,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.180]   you really have to push the body,
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.180]   like take the body through a journey.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.820]   I wish there was another way of doing that
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.540]   in the physical exercise space.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.860]   I think there are exercises
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.420]   that are easier on the body than others,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.980]   but running sure is a hell of an effective way to do it.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.060]   - And one of the ways that where it differs
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.560]   is that you're, unlike exercise,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.420]   you're essentially, you know,
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.500]   most exercise, to really get to those intense levels,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.860]   you really need to be persistent about it.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.740]   I mean, it'll be intense if you're really out of shape
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.680]   just jogging for five minutes,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.140]   but to really get to those intense levels,
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.900]   you need to have the dedication.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.220]   And so some of the other ways
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.900]   of altering subjective effects
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.300]   or states of consciousness take that type of dedication.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.060]   Psychedelics, though, I mean, someone takes the right dose,
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.540]   they're strapped into the roller coaster,
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.460]   and something interesting is gonna happen.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.620]   And I really like what you said
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.220]   about that distinction between the mind,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.620]   or the contrast between the mind effects
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.560]   and the bodily, the body effects,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.700]   because I think of this,
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.180]   I do research with all the drugs,
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.420]   you know, caffeine, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine,
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.780]   alcohol, legal, illegal.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.480]   Most of these drugs,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.360]   thinking about, say, cocaine and methamphetamine,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.780]   you can't give to a regular user,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.220]   you can't safely give a dose
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.660]   where the regular cocaine user is gonna say,
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.140]   "Oh man, that's like,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.380]   that's the strongest coke I've ever had," you know?
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.780]   Because, you know, you get it past the ethics committee
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.300]   and you need approval,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.340]   and I wouldn't wanna give someone something that's dangerous.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.180]   So to go to those levels where they would say that,
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.180]   you would have to give something
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.500]   that's physiologically riskier.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.340]   - Yeah.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.140]   - Psilocybin or LSD,
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   you can give a dose at the physiological level
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.660]   that is like, very good chance
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.540]   it's gonna be the most intense psychological experience
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.620]   of that person's life.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.260]   - Yeah, that's true. - And have zero chance
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260]   for most people, if you screen them, of killing them.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.320]   The big risk is behavioral toxicity,
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.820]   which is a fancy way of saying doing something stupid.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.180]   I mean, you're really intoxicated,
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.100]   like if you wander into traffic or you fall from a height,
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.420]   just like plenty of people do on high doses of alcohol.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.020]   And the other kind of unique thing
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.540]   about classic psychedelics is that they're not addictive,
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.160]   which is pretty much unheard of
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.020]   when it comes to so-called drugs of abuse
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.960]   or drugs that people, at least at some frequency,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.260]   choose to take.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.560]   You know, most of what we think of as drugs,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.500]   you know, even caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.000]   most of these you can get into alcohol,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.960]   you can get into a daily use pattern.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   And that's just so unheard of with psychedelics.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.880]   Most people have taken these things on a daily basis.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   It's more like they're building up the courage to do it,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.560]   and then they build up a tolerance.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   Or they're in college and they do it on a dare,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.120]   can you take acid seven days in a row?
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.320]   And that type of thing, rather than a self-control issue
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.480]   where you have and say, oh God, I gotta stop taking this,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.080]   I gotta stop drinking every night,
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.860]   I gotta cut down on the Coke, whatever.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.360]   - So that's the classic psychedelics.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.640]   What are the, what's a good term, modern psychedelics,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   or more maybe psychedelics that are created in the lab?
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.680]   What else is there?
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.240]   - Right, so MDMA is the big one.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.920]   And I should say that with the classic psychedelics,
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.840]   that LSD is sort of, you can call it a semi-synthetic,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.480]   because there's natural, you know,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.220]   from both ergot and in certain seeds,
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.920]   morning glory seeds is one example,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.520]   there's a very close, there are some very close
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.780]   chemical relatives of LSD,
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.900]   so LSD is close to what occurs in nature, but not quite.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.540]   But then when we get into the other non-classic psychedelics,
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.660]   probably the most prominent one is MDMA.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.080]   People call it ecstasy, people call it molly.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.580]   And it is, it differs from classic psychedelics
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.760]   in a number of ways.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.560]   It can be addictive, but not so.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.100]   It's like, you can have cocaine on this end
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.580]   of the continuum, and classic psychedelics here.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.660]   - Continuum of addiction?
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.100]   - Continuum of addiction, you know.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.020]   So it's certainly no cocaine.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.820]   It's pretty rare for people to get into daily use patterns,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.460]   but it's possible.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.140]   And they can get into more like, you know,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.100]   using once a week pattern,
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.140]   where they can find it hard to stop.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.260]   But it's somewhere in between,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.220]   mostly towards the classic psychedelic side,
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.880]   in terms of like, relatively little addiction potential.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.580]   But it's also more physiologically dangerous.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.300]   I think that the, certainly the therapeutic use,
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.240]   it's showing really promising effects for treating PTSD,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.280]   and the models that are used,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.880]   I think those are extremely acceptable
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.680]   when it comes to the risk-benefit ratio
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.000]   that you see all throughout medicine.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.560]   But nonetheless, we do know that at a certain dose
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.740]   and a certain frequency that MDMA can cause long-term damage
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.780]   to the serotonin system in the brain,
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.900]   so it doesn't have that level of kind of freakish,
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.140]   bodily safety that the classic psychedelics do.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.940]   And it has more of a heart load, a cardiovascular,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.500]   I don't mean kind of emotion, I mean, in this sense,
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.700]   although it is very emotional,
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.020]   and that's something unique about its subjective effects,
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.820]   but it's more of a presser.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.540]   - And the terminology used instead of like,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.220]   freakish capacities,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.260]   allowing you from a researcher perspective,
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.660]   but a personal perspective too,
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.340]   of taking a journey with some of these psychedelics,
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.900]   that is the heroic dose, as they say.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.000]   So like, these are tools that allow you
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.640]   to take a serious mental journey, whatever that is.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.480]   That's what you mean.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.060]   And with MDMA, there's a little bit,
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.060]   it starts entering this territory
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.760]   where you gotta be careful about the risks
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.020]   to the body, potentially.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.140]   - So yes, that, in the sense that you can't
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.780]   kind of push the dose up as high as safely as one can,
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.020]   if they're in the right setting, like in our research,
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.260]   as they can with the classic psychedelics.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.380]   But probably more importantly,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.180]   just the nature of the effects with MDMA
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.500]   aren't the full-on psychedelic.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.540]   It's not the full journey.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.780]   So it's sort of a psychedelic with rose-colored glasses on,
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.860]   a psychedelic that's more of,
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.420]   it's been called more of a heart trip than a head trip.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.760]   The nature of reality doesn't unravel
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.380]   as frequently as it does with classic psychedelics.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.300]   - But you're able to more directly sense your environment.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.020]   So your perception system still works.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.340]   It's not completely detached from reality with MDMA.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.880]   - That's true, relatively speaking.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.740]   That said, at most doses of classic psychedelics,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.580]   you still have a tether to reality.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.900]   Changes a little bit when you're talking about smoking DMT
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.060]   or smoking 5-methoxy DMT,
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.300]   which are some interesting examples
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.540]   we could talk more about.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.540]   But with MDMA, for example,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.660]   it's very rare to have what's called an ego loss experience
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.800]   or a sense of transcendental unity,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.380]   where one really seemingly loses
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.100]   the psychological construct of the self.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:24.020]   But MDMA, it's very common for people to have this,
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.780]   they still are perceiving themselves as a self,
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.260]   but it's common for them to have this warmth,
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.340]   this empathy for humanity
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.180]   and for their friends and loved ones.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.380]   So it's more of,
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.700]   and you see those effects under the classic psychedelics,
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.540]   but that's a subset of what the classic psychedelics do.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.420]   So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects,
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.580]   is if you think about Venn diagrams,
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.540]   it's sort of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.260]   So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session,
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.180]   sometimes a psilocybin session looks just like that.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.940]   But then sometimes it's completely different
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.760]   with psilocybin, it's a little more narrowed
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.180]   in terms of the variability with MDMA.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.680]   - Is there something general to say
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.540]   about what the psychedelics do to the human mind?
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.500]   You mentioned kind of an ego loss experience
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.580]   in the space of Venn diagrams,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.060]   if we're to like draw a big circle,
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.100]   what can we say about that big circle?
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:28.540]   - In terms of people's report of subjective experience,
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.740]   probably one of the most general things we can say
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.140]   is that it expands that range.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.280]   So many people come out of these sessions
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.780]   saying that they didn't know it was possible
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.100]   to have an experience like that.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   - So there's an emphasis on the subjective experience
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.100]   that is there words that people put to it
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.060]   that capture that experience
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.020]   or is it something that just has to be experienced?
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.980]   - Yeah, people like--
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.660]   - As a researcher, that's an interesting question
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.660]   because you have to kind of measure the effects of this
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.140]   and how do you convert that into numbers?
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.980]   - Right.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.860]   - That's the ultimate challenge.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.780]   Is that possible to one, convert it into words
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.300]   and the second, convert the words into numbers somehow?
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.140]   - So we do a lot of that with questionnaires,
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.060]   some of which are very psychometrically validated,
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.900]   so lots of numbers have been crunched on them.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.560]   And there's always a limitation with questionnaires.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.580]   I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.820]   Ultimately, it's what the person is reporting
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.400]   and that doesn't necessarily point towards a ground truth.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.700]   So for example, if someone says that they felt like
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.900]   they touched another dimension
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.580]   or they felt like they sensed the reality of God
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.220]   or if they, I mean, just you name it,
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.220]   people's ontological views can sometimes shift.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.140]   I think that's more about where they're coming from
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.180]   and I don't think it's the quintessential way
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.020]   in which they work.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.900]   There's plenty of people that hold on
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.620]   to a completely naturalistic viewpoint
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.620]   and have profound and helpful experiences
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.820]   with these compounds,
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.740]   but the subjective effects can be so broad
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.740]   that for some people, it shifts their philosophical viewpoint
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.140]   more towards idealism, more towards thinking of
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   that the nature of reality might be more about consciousness
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.180]   than about material.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.300]   That's a domain I'm very interested in.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.660]   Right now, we have essentially zero to say about that
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.140]   in terms of validating those types of claims,
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.260]   but it's even interesting just to see what people say
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.260]   along those lines.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.820]   - So you're interested in saying like,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.580]   can we more rigorously study this process of expansion?
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.980]   Like, what do we mean by this expansion of your sense
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.900]   of what is possible in the experiences in this world?
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.420]   - Right, as much as what we can say about that
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.780]   through naturalistic psychology.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.540]   Especially as much as we can root it
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.540]   to solid psychological constructs
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.180]   and solid neuroscientific constructs.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.900]   - And I wonder what the impact is of the language
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.500]   that you bring to the table.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.060]   So you mentioned about God or, speaking of God,
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.460]   a lot of people are really interested
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.420]   of theoretical physics these days at a very surface level,
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.940]   and you can bring the language of physics, right?
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.940]   You can talk about quantum mechanics.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.540]   You can talk about general relativity
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.500]   and curvature of space-time,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   and using just that language
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.260]   without a deep technical understanding of it
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.660]   to somehow start thinking like,
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.020]   sort of visualizing atoms in your head
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.540]   and somehow through that process,
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.860]   because you have the language,
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.260]   using that language to kinda dissolve the ego,
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.900]   like realize that we're just all little bits
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.820]   of physical objects that behave in mysterious ways.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.780]   And so that has to do with the language.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.980]   Like if you read a Sean Carroll book or something recently,
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.820]   it seems like it has a huge influence
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.700]   on the way you might experience,
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.100]   might perceive the world and might experience
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.500]   the alteration that psychedelics brings
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.260]   to your perception system.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.980]   So I wonder, like, the language you bring to the table,
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.420]   how that affects the journey you go on with the psychedelics.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.740]   - I think very much so.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.860]   And I think there's, I'm a little concerned
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.700]   some of the science is going a little too far
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.500]   in the direction of around the edges,
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.500]   speaking about changing beliefs in this sense or that sense
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.740]   about particular, in particular domains.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.620]   And I think what really what,
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.660]   a lot of what's going on is what you just discussed.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.820]   It's the priors coming into it.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.940]   So if you've been reading a lot of physics,
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.820]   then you might bring up like space-time
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.100]   and interpret the experience in that sense.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.980]   I mean, it's not uncommon for people come out
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.420]   talking about visions of the,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.500]   it's not the most typical thing,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.180]   but it's come up in sessions I've guided,
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.500]   the Big Bang and the, you know,
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.980]   this sort of nature of reality.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.900]   I think probably the best way to think
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.460]   about these experiences is that,
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.500]   and the best evidence,
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.500]   even though we're in our infancy and understanding it,
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.740]   they really tap into more general psychological mechanisms.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.500]   I think one of the best arguments is
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.380]   they reduce the influence of our priors,
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.340]   of what we bring into the,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.900]   all of the assumptions that we all,
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.020]   that we're essentially, especially as adults,
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.380]   we're riding on top of heuristic after heuristic
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.900]   to get through life.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.300]   And you need to do that.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.380]   And that's a good thing.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.820]   And that's extremely efficient.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.700]   And evolution has shaped that,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.780]   but that comes at an expense.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.780]   And it seems that these experiences
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.860]   will allow someone greater mental flexibility and openness.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:16.940]   And so one can be both less influenced
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.940]   by their prior assumptions,
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.180]   but still nonetheless,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.340]   the nature of the experience can be influenced
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.500]   by what they've been exposed to in the world.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.480]   And sometimes they can get it in a deeper way.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.320]   Like maybe they've read,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.580]   I mean, I had a philosophy professor one time
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.980]   as a participant in a high-dose psilocybin study.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.100]   And he's like, I remember him saying,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.420]   "My God, it's like Hegel's opposites defining each other.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.540]   "Like, I get it.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   "I've taught this thing for years and years and years.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.420]   "Like, I get it now."
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.100]   And so like that, you know,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.500]   and even at the psychological, emotional level,
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.700]   like the cancer patients we worked with,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.300]   you know, they told themselves a million times
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.620]   over the people trying to quit smoking,
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.620]   "I need to quit smoking.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.700]   "Oh, I'm ruining my life with this cancer.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.540]   "I'm still healthy.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.360]   "I should be getting out.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.680]   "I'm letting this thing defeat me."
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.260]   It's like, yeah, you told yourself that in your head,
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.820]   but sometimes they had these experiences
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.180]   and they kind of feel it in their heart.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.940]   Like they really get it.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.940]   - So in some sense that you bring some prize to the table,
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:22.060]   but psychedelics allow you to acknowledge them
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.340]   and then throw them away.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.720]   So like one popular terminology around this
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.800]   in the engineering space is first principles thinking
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.860]   that Elon Musk, for example, espouses a lot.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.100]   Let me ask a fun question
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.400]   before we return to a more serious discussion.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.160]   With Elon Musk as an example,
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.140]   but it could be just engineers in general.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.560]   Do you think there's a use for psychedelics
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   to take a journey of rigorous first principles thinking?
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.660]   So like throwing away,
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.400]   we're not talking about throwing away assumptions
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.120]   about the nature of reality in terms of like our philosophy
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.060]   of the way we live day-to-day life,
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.240]   but we're talking about like how to build a better rocket
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.960]   or how to build a better car
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.360]   or how to build a better social network
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.040]   or all those kinds of things, engineering questions.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.720]   - I absolutely think there's huge potential there.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   And there was some research in the late '60s, early '70s
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.020]   that it was very early and not very rigorous
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.100]   in terms of methodology,
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.340]   but it was consistent with the,
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.960]   I mean, there's just countless anecdotes of folks.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.140]   I mean, people have argued that just Silicon Valley
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.740]   was largely influenced by psychedelic experience.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.780]   I remember the, I think the person that came up
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.260]   with the concept of freeware or shareware,
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.460]   it's like it kind of was generated out of
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.720]   or influenced by psychedelic experience.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.340]   So to this, I think there's incredible potential there
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.400]   and we know really next,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.180]   there's no rigorous research on that, but.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.700]   - Is there anecdotal stuff like with Steve Jobs?
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.520]   I think there's stories, right?
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.040]   In your exploration of that,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.680]   is there something a little bit more than just stories?
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.440]   Is there like a little bit more of a solid data points,
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.820]   even if they're just experiential like anecdotes,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.940]   is there something that you draw inspiration from
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.340]   like in your intuition?
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.580]   'Cause we'll talk about,
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.220]   you're trying to construct studies
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.420]   that are more rigorous around these questions,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.660]   but is there something you draw inspiration from,
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.220]   from the past, from the '80s and the '90s
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.200]   and Silicon Valley, that kind of space?
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.380]   Or is it just like you have a sense
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.560]   based on everything you've learned
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.600]   and these kind of loose stories
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.460]   that there's something worth digging at?
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.140]   - I am influenced by the, gosh,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.140]   the just incredible number of anecdotes surrounding these.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.260]   I mean,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:02.140]   Carey Mullis, he invented PCR.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.900]   I mean, absolutely revolutionized biological sciences.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.380]   He says he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize for him
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.780]   and said he wouldn't have come up with that
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.040]   had he not had psychedelic experiences.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.540]   Now he's an interesting character.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.080]   People should read his autobiography
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.620]   'cause you could point to other things he was into.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.660]   But I think that speaks to the casting your nets wide
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.740]   and this mental flex,
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.320]   more of these general mechanisms
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.700]   where sometimes if you cast your nets really wide
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.220]   and it's gonna depend on the person and their influences,
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.220]   but sometimes you come up with false positives.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.040]   You connect the dots
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.220]   where maybe you shouldn't have connected those dots.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.700]   But I think that can be constrained
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.200]   and so much of our,
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.180]   not only our personal psychological suffering,
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.160]   but our limitations academically
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.620]   and in terms of technology
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.620]   are because of the self-imposed limitations and heuristics,
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.620]   these entrenched ways of thinking.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.460]   Like those examples throughout the history of science
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.980]   where someone has come up with a rat,
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.620]   the paradigm, Kuhn's paradigm shifts.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.540]   It's like, here's something completely different.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.140]   This doesn't make sense by any of the previous models
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.540]   and we need more of those.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.620]   And then you need the right balance between that
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.920]   because so many of the novel, crazy ideas are just bunk.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.260]   That's what science is about,
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.860]   separating them from the valid paradigm shifting ideas.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   But we need more paradigm shifting ideas in a big way.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.100]   And I think you could argue that we've,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.140]   because of the structure of academia and science
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.100]   in modern times, it heavily biases against those.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.660]   - Right, there's all kinds of mechanisms in our human nature
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.980]   that resist paradigm shift quite sort of obviously.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.060]   So, and psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools,
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.780]   but it seems like psychedelics could be one set of tools
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.340]   that encourage paradigm shifting thinking.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.380]   So like the first principles kind of thinking.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.140]   So as a kind of, you're at the forefront of research here.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.780]   There's just kind of anecdotal stories.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.300]   There's early studies.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.500]   There's a sense that we don't understand very much,
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.760]   but there's a lot of depth here.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.460]   How do we get from there to where Elon and I can regularly,
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.020]   like I wake up every morning, I have deep work sessions
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:40.020]   where it's well understood, like what dose to take.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:46.000]   Like if I want to explore something where it's all legal,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.020]   where it's all understood and safe, all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.540]   How do we get from where we are today to there?
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.220]   Not speaking in terms of legality in the sense like
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.900]   policymaking, all that like laws and stuff.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.940]   Meaning like, how do we scientifically understand this stuff
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.540]   well enough to get to a place where I can just take it
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.800]   safely in order to expand my thinking,
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.540]   like this kind of first principles thinking,
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.780]   which I'm in my personal life currently doing.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.420]   Like how do I revolutionize particular several things?
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.300]   Like it seems like the only tools I have right now,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:27.040]   it's just, just, but my mind going,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.420]   doing the first principles, like, wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.760]   Okay, why has this been done this way?
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.780]   Can we do completely differently?
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.500]   It seems like I'm still tethered to the priors
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.820]   that I bring to the table and I keep trying
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.860]   to untether myself.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.140]   Maybe there's tools that can systematically
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.600]   help me untether.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.260]   - Yeah, well, we need experiments, you know,
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.980]   and that's tied to kind of the policy level stuff.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.320]   And I should be clear, I would never encourage anyone
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   to do anything illicitly, but yeah, you know,
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.800]   in the future we could see these, you know,
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   compounds used for technical and scientific innovation.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.680]   What we need are studies that are digging into that.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.740]   Right now, most of what the funding,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.040]   which is largely from philanthropy,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   not from the government, largely what it's for
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   is treatment of mental disorders like addiction
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.020]   and depression, et cetera.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.240]   But we need studies.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.400]   You know, one of the early initial stabs
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.380]   on this question decades ago was they took some architects
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.940]   and engineers and said, what problems have you
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:40.860]   been working on?
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.460]   Where have you been stuck for months,
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.740]   like working on this damn thing
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.040]   and you're not getting anywhere?
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.420]   You're like, your head's butting up against the wall.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.180]   It's like, come in here, take,
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.140]   and I think it was 100 micrograms of LSD.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.740]   So not a big session.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.260]   And a little bit different model
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.260]   where they were actually working.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.140]   It was a moderate enough dose where they could work
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.940]   on the problem during the session.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:04.420]   I think probably, I'm an empiricist,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.300]   so I'd like to see all the studies done.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.460]   But the first thing I would do is a really high dose session
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.100]   where you're not necessarily in front of your computer,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.020]   which you can't really do on a really high dose.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.420]   - And then the work has been talked about,
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.760]   you take a really high dose, you take a journey,
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.220]   and then the breakthroughs come from when you return
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.100]   from the journey and like integrate, quote unquote,
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.060]   that experience.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.660]   - I think that's where all the,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.660]   again, we're babies at this point,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.460]   but my gut tells me, yeah,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.260]   that it's the so-called integration, the aftermath.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.060]   We know that there's some different forms
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.700]   of neuroplasticity that are unfolding
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.780]   in the days following a psychedelic, at least in animals.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   Probably going on humans,
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.300]   we don't know if that's related to the therapeutic effects.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.620]   My gut tells me it is,
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.940]   although it's only part of the story.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.660]   But we need big studies where we compare people,
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.660]   like let's get a hundred people like that,
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.380]   scientists that are working on a problem,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.100]   and then randomize them too.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.020]   And then I think you need a even more credible,
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.100]   active controls or active placebo conditions
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.300]   to kind of tease this out.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.900]   And then also in conjunction with that,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.260]   and you can do this in the same study,
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.140]   you wanna combine that with more rigorous
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.900]   sort of experimental models
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.260]   where we actually get there are problem solving tasks
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.180]   that we know, for example,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.700]   that you tend to do better on
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.180]   after you've gotten a good night's sleep versus not.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.860]   And my sense is there's a relationship there.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.780]   The people go back to first principles,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.220]   questioning those first principles they're operating under
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.100]   and getting away from their priors
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.380]   in terms of creative problem solving.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.460]   And so you, I think, wrap those things
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.180]   and you could speak a little more rigorously about those.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.180]   'Cause ultimately, if everyone's bringing their own problem,
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.060]   that's more on the face valid side,
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.780]   but you can't dig in as much
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.300]   and get as much experimental power
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.680]   and speak to the mechanisms as you can
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.820]   with having everyone do the same sort of canned
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.840]   problem solving task.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.980]   - So we've been speaking about psychedelics generally.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.060]   Is there one you find from the scientific perspective
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.300]   or maybe even philosophical perspective
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.580]   that's the most fascinating to study?
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.340]   - Therapeutically, I'm most interested in psilocybin and LSD
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.380]   and I think we need to do a lot more with LSD
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.060]   because it's mainly been psilocybin in the modern era.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.540]   I've recently gotten a grant
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.260]   from the Hefter Research Institute to do an LSD study.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.440]   So I haven't started it yet,
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.340]   but I'm going through the paperwork and everything.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.980]   - Therapeutic meaning there's some issue
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.380]   and you're trying to treat that issue.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.740]   - Right, right.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.660]   In terms of just like what's the most fascinating,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.660]   understanding the nature of these experiences
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.200]   if you really wanna like wrap your head
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.860]   around what's going on when someone has
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.720]   a completely altered sense of reality and sense of self.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   There I think you're talking about the high dose,
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.000]   either smoked, vaporized or intravenous injection,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.820]   which all kind of, they're very similar pharmacologically
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.200]   of DMT and 5-methoxy DMT.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.220]   This is like when people, this is what,
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.260]   I don't know if you're familiar with Terrence McKinney,
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.860]   he would talk a lot about smoking DMT.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.740]   Joe Rogan has talked a lot about that.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.620]   People will say that,
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.460]   and there's a close relative called 5-methoxy DMT.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.460]   Most people who know the terrain will say
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.460]   that's an order of magnitude or orders of magnitude beyond,
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.580]   I mean, anything one could get
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.200]   from even a high dose of psilocybin or LSD.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.500]   I think it's a question about whether,
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.540]   you know, how therapeutic.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.460]   I think there is a therapeutic potential there,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.340]   but it's probably not as sure of a bet
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.820]   because one goes so far out,
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.780]   it's almost like they're not contemplating their relationship
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.880]   and their direction in life.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.700]   They are like reality is ripping apart at the seams
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   and the very nature of the self and of the sense of reality.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.300]   And the amazing thing about these compounds,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.540]   and same to a lesser degree with oral psilocybin and LSD
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.500]   is that unlike some other drugs
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.840]   that really throw you far out there,
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.820]   you know, anesthetics and even alcohol,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.760]   like as reality starts to become different
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.840]   at higher and higher doses, there's this numbing.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.940]   There's this sort of,
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:31.580]   there's this ability for the sense of being the center,
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.180]   having a conscious experience that's memorable
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.400]   that is maintained
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.160]   throughout these classic psychedelic experiences.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.760]   Like one can go as far, so far out
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.720]   while still
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.520]   being aware of the experience
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.160]   and remembering the experience.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.480]   - Interesting, so being able to carry something back.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.720]   - Right.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.600]   - Can you dig in a little deeper?
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.340]   Like what is DMT?
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.020]   How long is the trip usually?
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.380]   Like how much do we understand about it?
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.800]   Is there something interesting to say
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.960]   about just the nature of the experience
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.400]   and what we understand about it?
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.720]   - One of the common methods for people to use it
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.840]   is to smoke it or vaporize it.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.720]   And it usually takes,
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.440]   this is a pretty good kind of description
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.480]   of what it might feel like on the ground.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:31.000]   The caveat is it's a completely insufficient description
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.040]   and someone's gonna be listening.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.920]   Who has done this, it's like nothing you could say
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.160]   is gonna come close.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.580]   But it'll take about three big hits, inhalations
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.340]   in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.100]   And there's no great definition of that,
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.600]   but basically meaning moving away from,
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.280]   not just having the typical psilocybin or LSD experience
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.340]   where like things are radically different,
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.480]   but you're still basically a person in this reality
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.840]   to go in somewhere else.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.660]   And so that'll typically take like three hits.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.580]   And this stuff comes on like a freight train.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.380]   So one takes a hit and around the time
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.220]   of the first exhalation,
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.300]   so we're talking about a few seconds in,
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.580]   or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit,
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.900]   it'll start to come on.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.020]   And they're already up to, let's say,
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:31.260]   what they might get from a 30 milligram
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.380]   or 300 microgram LSD trip, a big trip.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.660]   They're already there at the second hit,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.820]   but they're going, their consciousness is geared,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.460]   this is like acceleration, not speed,
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.700]   to speak of physics, okay?
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.900]   It's like those receptors are getting filled like that
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.620]   and they're going from zero to 60 in like Tesla time.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.780]   And at the second hit, again,
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.780]   they're at maybe the strongest psychedelic experience
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.100]   they've ever had.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.860]   And then if they can take that third hit,
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.060]   and some people can't,
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:11.300]   they're propelled into this other reality.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.500]   And the nature of that other reality will differ
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.780]   depending on who you ask,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.220]   but folks will often talk about,
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.340]   and we've done some survey research on this,
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.340]   entities of different types, elves tend to pop up.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.220]   The caveat is that I strongly presume
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.980]   all of this is culturally influenced,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.700]   but thinking more about the psychology and the neuroscience,
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.060]   there is probably something fundamental,
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.260]   like for someone that might be colored as elves,
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.460]   others that might be colored as,
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.900]   Terrence McKenna called them self-dribbling basketballs,
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.300]   for someone else, it might be little animals,
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.100]   or someone else, it might be aliens.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:57.100]   I think that probably is dependent on who they are
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.100]   and what they've been exposed to,
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.900]   but just the fact that one has this sense
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.740]   that they're surrounded by autonomous entities.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   - Right, intelligent, autonomous entities.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.620]   - Right, and people come back with stories
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.740]   that are just astonishing.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.780]   There's communication between these entities,
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.460]   and often they're telling them things
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.260]   that the person says are self-validating,
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.620]   but it seems like it's impossible.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.700]   It really seems like, and again,
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.620]   this is what people say oftentimes,
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.260]   that it really is like downloading some intelligence
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.500]   from a higher dimension,
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.300]   or whatever metaphor you wanna use.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.060]   Sometimes these things come up in dreams,
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.660]   where it's like someone is exposed to something that,
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.740]   I've had this in a dream,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.620]   where it seems like what they are being exposed to
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.700]   is physically impossible,
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.180]   but yet at the same time, self-validating.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.020]   It seems true,
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.900]   like that they really are figuring something out.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.900]   Of course, the challenge is to say something
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.700]   in concrete terms after the experience
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.020]   that where you could verify that in any way,
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.940]   and I'm not familiar of any examples of that.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.660]   - Well, there's a sense in which,
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.980]   I suppose the experience is like,
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:22.380]   you're a limited cognitive creature
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.300]   that knows very little about the world,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:29.220]   and here's a chance to communicate with much wiser entities
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.260]   that in a way that you can't possibly understand
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.260]   are trying to give you hints of deeper truths.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.540]   And so there's that kind of sense
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.300]   that you can take something back,
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.540]   but you can't,
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.500]   where our cognition is not capable
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.420]   to fully grasp the truth,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.540]   we'll just get a kind of sense of it,
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.900]   and somehow that process is mind-expanding,
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.180]   that there's a greater truth out there.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.020]   - Right.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.740]   - That seems like what,
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.140]   from the people I've heard talk about,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.140]   that seems to be what it is,
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.100]   and that's so fascinating that there's,
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.980]   there's fundamentally to this whole thing
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.100]   is a communication between an entity
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.420]   that is other than yourself, entities.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.820]   So it's not just like a visual experience,
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.100]   like you're floating through the world,
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.380]   is there's other beings there,
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.220]   which is kind of,
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.340]   I don't know,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.980]   I don't know what to sort of,
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.700]   from a person who likes Freud and Carl Jung,
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.180]   I don't know what to think about that.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.580]   That being, of course,
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.660]   from one perspective is just you looking in the mirror,
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.100]   but it could also be from another perspective,
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.860]   like actually talking to other beings.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.260]   - Yeah, and you mentioned Jung,
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.340]   and I think that's,
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.660]   he's particularly interesting,
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.740]   and it kind of points to something I was
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.460]   thinking about saying is that,
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.500]   I think what might be going on natural,
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.060]   from a naturalistic perspective,
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.660]   so regardless, whether or not there are,
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.660]   it doesn't depend on autonomous entities out there,
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.460]   what might be happening is that just
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.460]   the associative net,
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.020]   the level of learning,
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:16.060]   the comprehension might be so
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.220]   beyond what someone is used to
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.500]   that the only way for the nervous system,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.500]   for the aware sense of self to orient towards it
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.660]   is all by metaphor.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.300]   And so I do think,
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.820]   when we get into these realms,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.380]   as a strong empiricist,
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.940]   I think we always gotta be careful
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.500]   and be as grounded as possible,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.180]   but I'm also willing to speculate
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.220]   and sort of cast the nets wide with caveat,
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.500]   but I think of things like archetypes,
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:49.780]   and it's plausible that there are certain stories,
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:50.740]   there are certain,
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.820]   we've gone through millions of years of evolution,
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.380]   it may be that we have certain
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.580]   characters and stories that are sort of,
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.060]   that our central nervous system is sort of wired to tend to--
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.780]   - Yeah, those stories, we carry those stories in us.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.020]   - Right. - And this unlocks them
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.500]   in a certain kind of way.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.940]   - And we think about stories,
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.460]   like our sense of self is basically,
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.140]   narrative self is a story,
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.740]   and we think about the world of stories.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.300]   This is why metaphors are always more powerful than,
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.540]   sort of laying out all the details all the time,
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.740]   speaking in parables,
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.500]   it's like if you really get some,
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.140]   this is why, as much as I hate it,
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.340]   if you're presenting to Congress or something,
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.820]   and you have all the best data in the world,
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.300]   it's not as powerful as that one anecdote
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.460]   as the mom dying of cancer
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.620]   that had the psilocybin session
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.580]   and it transformed her life.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.540]   That's a story, that's meaningful.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.300]   And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   and experience happens with DMT ingestion,
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:04.780]   these stories of entities, they might be that,
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.380]   stories that are constructed that is the closest,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.020]   which is not to say the stories aren't real.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.700]   I mean, I think we're getting to layers where--
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   - What is real, man? - It doesn't really, right.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.980]   Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.140]   But it's the closest we can come to making sense out of it
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.300]   because what we do know about these psychedelics,
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.100]   one of the levels beyond the receptor
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.420]   is that the brain is communicating it with itself
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.460]   in a massively different way.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.500]   There's massive communication with areas
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.620]   that don't normally communicate.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.940]   And so I think that comes with both,
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.660]   it's casting the nets wide.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.060]   I think that comes with the insights
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.800]   and helpful novel ways of thinking.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.380]   I do think it comes with false positives.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.180]   That could be some of the delusion.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:52.260]   And so when you're so far out there,
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.780]   like with DMT experience,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:58.740]   like maybe alien is the best way
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.540]   that the mind can wrap some arms around that.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.700]   - So I don't know how much you're familiar with Joe Rogan,
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.380]   but he does bring up DMT quite a bit.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.980]   It's almost a meme.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.220]   It is a meme.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.700]   Have you ever, what is it?
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.060]   Have you ever tried DMT?
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.260]   (laughs)
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.620]   - I mean, I think he talks about this experience
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.300]   of having met other entities
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.540]   and they were mocking him, I think,
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.680]   if I remember the experience correctly,
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.180]   like laughing at him and saying F-you, F-you,
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.740]   or something like that.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.300]   I may be misremembering this,
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.260]   but there was a general mockery.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.260]   And what he learned from that experience
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.600]   is that he shouldn't take himself too seriously.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.460]   So it's the dissolution of the ego and so on.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.820]   Like, what do you think about that experience?
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.620]   And maybe if you have more general things
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.620]   about Joe's infatuation with DMT
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.700]   and if DMT has that important role to play
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.980]   in popular culture in general.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.420]   - I'm definitely familiar with it.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.980]   I remember telling you offline
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:09.420]   that the first time I learned who Joe Rogan was,
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.460]   it was probably 15 years ago.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.200]   And I came upon a clip and I realized
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.780]   there's another person in the world
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.020]   who's into both DMT and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.220]   And I think both those worlds have grown dramatically since,
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.460]   and it's probably not such a special club these days.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:29.020]   So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.980]   - You were into both before it was cool.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.820]   - Right, I mean, this is all relative
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.500]   'cause there's people that were before the late '90s
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.820]   and early 2000s that were into it
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.400]   that say you're a Johnny-come-lately.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.460]   But yeah, compared to where we're at now.
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.940]   But yet one of the things I always found fascinating
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.940]   by Joe's telling of his experiences, I think,
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.500]   is that they resemble very much
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.860]   Terrence McKenna's experiences with DMT.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.020]   And Joe has talked very much about Terrence McKenna
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.260]   and his experiences.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.660]   If I had to guess, I would guess
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.540]   that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.460]   talk about his experiences,
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:15.660]   that that influenced the coloring of Joe's experience.
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.260]   - It's funny how that works.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.000]   'Cause I mean, that's why McKenna hasn't...
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I mean, poets and great orators give us the words
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.580]   to then start to describe our experiences
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.640]   'cause our words are limited, our language is limited.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.260]   And it's always nice to get some kind of nice poetry
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.400]   into the mix to allow us to put words to it.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.520]   - Right.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.060]   But I also see some elements
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.220]   that seem to relate to Joe's psychology,
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.340]   just from what I've seen of him,
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.940]   from hours of watching him on his podcast,
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:52.380]   is that he's a self-critical guy.
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.980]   And I think with all his positive...
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.780]   Ben, I'm always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.220]   and no one else really says it about cannabis.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.140]   I'll get back to the DMT thing about,
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.340]   he likes the kind of the paranoid side of things.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.860]   He's like, that's you radically examining yourself.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.560]   It's like, that's not just a bad thing.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.980]   That's you need to look hard at yourself
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.100]   and something's making you uncomfortable, dig into that.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.880]   And it's sort of along the lines of Goggins with exercise.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.020]   And it's like, yeah, learning experiences
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   aren't supposed to be easy.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.820]   Take advantage of these uncomfortable experiences.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.040]   It's why we call in our research in a safe context,
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.240]   with psychedelics, they're not bad trips,
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.840]   they're challenging experiences.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.680]   - Nice, yes.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.380]   Yeah, it's fascinating, just as a tiny tangent.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.780]   It's always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana,
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.980]   like weed, as the paranoia, the anxiety,
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.420]   or whatever that you experience
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.580]   as actually the fuel for the experience.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.420]   Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he's writing.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.500]   That's inspiring to me
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.460]   because then you can't possibly have a bad experience.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.500]   I'm a huge fan of that.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.400]   Like every experience is good.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.780]   - Right, which is very Goggins.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.540]   - Yeah, yeah, is it bad?
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.300]   Okay, all right, great.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.980]   - Well, see, Goggins is one side of that.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.740]   He wants it bad.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:14.840]   Like he wants the experience to be challenging always.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.500]   But I mean, like both are good.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.700]   Like the few times I've taken mushrooms,
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.340]   the experience was like, everything was beautiful.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.900]   There's zero challenging aspect to it.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.020]   It was just like, the world is beautiful.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.100]   And it gave me this deep appreciation of the world,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.420]   I would say.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.820]   So like that's amazing.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.220]   But also ones that challenge you are also amazing,
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.820]   like all the times I drink vodka.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.340]   (both laughing)
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.960]   But that's another, let's not.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.400]   So back to DMT.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.240]   - Yeah, Joe's treating cannabis as a psychedelic,
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.260]   which is something that I'd say,
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.660]   like a lot of people treat it more like Xanax,
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.380]   or like beer, or vodka.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.420]   But he's really trying to delve into those,
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.820]   it's been called a minor psychedelic.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.300]   So with DMT, as you brought up,
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.820]   it's like the entity's mocking him.
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:11.980]   And it's like, you're not, I mean,
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.860]   this reminds me of him describing his,
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   writing his, or just his entire method of comedy.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.080]   It's like, watch the tape of yourself.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.140]   Don't just ignore it.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.300]   Like, that's where I screwed up.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.580]   That's where I need to do better.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.760]   This like sort of radical self-examination,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.060]   which I think our society is kind of getting away from,
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.980]   'cause like, all the children win trophies type of thing.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.720]   You know, it's like, no, no, don't go overboard,
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.300]   but like recognize when you've messed up.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.800]   And so like, that's a big part of the psychedelic experience.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.900]   Like people come out sometimes saying,
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.140]   my God, I need to say sorry to my mom.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:51.980]   - Yeah.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.200]   - You know, like, it's so obvious.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.860]   Like, or whatever, you know, interpersonal issue,
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.420]   or like, my God, I don't, I'm not pulling enough weight
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.780]   around the house and helping my wife.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:07.140]   And you know, these things that are just obvious to them,
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.820]   the self-criticism that can be a very positive thing
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.840]   if you act on it.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.600]   - You've mentioned addiction.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.260]   Maybe we could take a little bit detour
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.180]   and into a darker aspect of things,
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.260]   or not even darker, it's just an important aspect of things.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.740]   What's the nature of addiction?
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.980]   You've mentioned some things within the big umbrella
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.580]   of psychedelics, maybe usually not addictive,
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.140]   but maybe MDMA, I think you said,
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.180]   might have some addictive properties.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.060]   But the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.940]   can often be highly addictive.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.360]   So you've studied addiction from several angles,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.820]   one of which is behavioral economics.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.700]   What have you understood about addiction?
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.820]   What is addiction from the biological,
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.140]   physiological level to the psychological,
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:02.560]   to whatever is the interesting way to talk about addiction?
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.680]   - Yeah, and the lenses that I view addiction through
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.700]   very much are behavioral economic,
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.420]   but I also think they converge on,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.500]   I think it's beautiful, at the other end of the spectrum,
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.500]   sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.340]   And it converges on what people come out of,
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.700]   you know, 12-step meetings talking about.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.340]   - Can you say what is behavioral economics
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.220]   and what is humanistic psychology?
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.060]   What do you mean by that?
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.820]   And more importantly, behavioral economics lens.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:34.660]   What is that?
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:37.220]   - So behavioral economics, my definition of it
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.540]   is the application of economic principles,
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.600]   mostly microeconomic principles.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   So understanding the behavior of individual agents
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.540]   surrounding commodities in the marketplace,
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:55.540]   applying microeconomic types of analyses
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.940]   to non-economic behavior.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.500]   So basically at one point, like psychologists figured out
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.580]   that there's this whole other discipline
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.820]   that's been studying behavior,
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.580]   it just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior,
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.440]   spending and saving money, et cetera.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.580]   But it comes with all of these principles
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.740]   that can be wildly and fruitfully applied
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.980]   to understanding behavior.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.540]   So for example, I've studied things like
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.060]   demand curve analysis of drug consumption.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.100]   So I look at, for example,
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.440]   the tobacco, cigarettes, and nicotine products
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.380]   through the lens of demand curves.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.380]   And in other words, at different prices,
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.740]   if there's different work requirements
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.460]   for being able to smoke cigarettes,
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.980]   sort of modeling price.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.140]   - Within that price data,
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.500]   there is some indication of addiction,
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.100]   how much you, the habits that you form
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.620]   around these particular drugs.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.380]   - It's one important dimension.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.100]   So I think a particularly important one there
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.500]   is elasticity or inelasticity,
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.660]   two ends of the spectrum.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.340]   So that's the price sensitivity.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.740]   So for example, you could have something
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.740]   that's pretty price inelastic, like gasoline.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:16.940]   So the price of gas at times can keep going up
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:20.460]   and Americans are just gonna pretty much
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.540]   buy the same amount of gas,
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.100]   or maybe the price of gas doubles,
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.260]   but their consumption only decreases by 10%.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.620]   So it's a sub-proportional reduction.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.940]   So that's an inelastic.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.220]   And that changes, like you push the price up high enough.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.540]   I mean, if it was $100 a gallon,
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.340]   it would eventually turn, the curve would turn
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.420]   and go downward more drastically and it would be elastic.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:44.060]   But you can apply that to someone,
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.940]   someone who, a regular cigarette smoker,
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.660]   who is working for cigarette puffs,
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:52.620]   who's gone six hours without smoking.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.540]   And you're asking questions like,
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:57.580]   yeah, how many times are they willing to pull this knob
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.300]   in the lab during this three hour session?
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.420]   I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:05.460]   How does the content of nicotine in that affect it?
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.340]   How's the availability of nicotine replacement products
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.460]   like nicotine gum or e-cigarettes affect those decisions?
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.340]   So you can, it's a certain lens of,
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:17.380]   it's sort of a way to take the kind of the classic
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:21.900]   behavioral psychology definition of reinforcement,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.300]   which is just basically reward.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.500]   How much is this a good thing?
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.900]   And it kind of breaks that apart
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:31.060]   into a multi-dimensional space.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.580]   So it's not just the ideas reward or reinforcement
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.180]   is not unit dimensional.
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.580]   So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.180]   At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.060]   So the classic example is luxury versus necessity.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.580]   So diamonds versus toilet paper.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.460]   So at those cheap prices,
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.140]   you can look at something called intensity of demand.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.260]   If it was basically as cheap as possible,
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.980]   or essentially zero, how much would you buy of this good?
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:02.840]   But then you keep jacking up the price and you'll see,
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.260]   so diamonds will look like the better reward
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:10.000]   at that low price or intensity of demand side of things.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.420]   But as you keep jacking up the price,
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.300]   you gotta have some toilet paper.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.740]   And again, we can get into the whole like bidet thing,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.580]   but forget that.
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.560]   You know, like I know Joe's been pushing that too.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.020]   You're gonna hang on and keep buying the toilet paper
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.700]   to a greater degree than you will the diamonds.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.940]   So you'll see a crossing of demand curves.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.900]   So what's the better reinforcer?
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.860]   What's the better reward?
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:33.660]   Depends on your price.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:37.260]   And so that's an example of one way to,
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.540]   and that of look at addiction.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.940]   So specifically drug consumption,
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.540]   which isn't all of addiction,
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:46.540]   but it's like in order for something to be addictive,
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.900]   it has to be a reward.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   And it has to compete with other rewards in your life.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:59.260]   And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my view,
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.740]   and this doesn't map onto how the DSM,
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.560]   the psychiatry Bible defines addiction,
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.460]   which I think is largely bunk,
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.820]   but there's some value to have some common description,
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.980]   but it's, you know,
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:15.260]   how rewarding is it from this multi-dimensional lens?
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.820]   And specifically, how does that rewarding value compete
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:24.820]   with other rewards, other consequences in your life?
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:30.140]   So it's not a problem if the use of that substance
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.780]   is rewarding, you know, okay, yeah,
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.180]   you like to have a couple of beers every once in a while,
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.580]   it's like not a problem.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:42.740]   But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:47.700]   that it tanks their career, it ruins their marriage.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.560]   It's in competition with these pro-social aspects
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.400]   to their life.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.900]   - It's all about comparing to the other choices
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.860]   you're making, the other activities in your life.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.380]   And if you evaluate it as a much higher reward
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.420]   than anything else, that becomes an addiction.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.260]   - Right, right.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.300]   And so it's not just the rewarding value,
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.100]   but it's the relative rewarding value.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.260]   And the other major aspect, again,
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.820]   from behavioral economics,
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.460]   the thing that makes addiction
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.420]   is something called delayed discounting.
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.500]   So in economics, sometimes it's called time preference.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.860]   It's what compound interest rates are based upon.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.420]   It's the idea that delaying a good,
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.460]   access to a good or a reward
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.200]   comes with a certain decrement to its value.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.780]   So we'd all rather have things now than later.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:41.980]   And we can study this at the individual level of,
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.980]   you know, would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow?
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:52.820]   And when you do that, you get huge differences
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.440]   between addicted populations and non-addicted.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.460]   Not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.140]   like normal everyday cigarette smokers.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.180]   And even when you look at something like,
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.420]   you know, monetary rewards.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.380]   And so you can go into the rabbit hole
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.680]   with this delayed discounting model.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.380]   So it's not only those huge differences
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.300]   that seem to have a face valid aspect to it.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.500]   Like the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.500]   that's rewarding today,
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.400]   but I know it comes with increased risk
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.060]   of having these horrible consequences down the line.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.480]   So it's this competition between what's good for me now
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.360]   and what's good for me later.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.760]   And the other aspect about delayed discounting is that
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.680]   if you quantitatively map out
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.260]   that discounting curve over time.
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.220]   So you don't just do the, you know,
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:43.100]   how much, you know, that $10 tomorrow,
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.200]   how much is it worth to you today?
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.460]   So you can say, what about nine?
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.300]   What about eight?
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.240]   What about $7?
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.040]   And you can titrate it to find that indifference point.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.960]   And so we can say, aha, $6.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.700]   You know, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 to you today.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.020]   So it's by the one day it's decreased by 40%.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.180]   We can do that also at one week and one month
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.440]   and one year and 10 years and map out that curve,
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.640]   get a shape of that curve.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.460]   And one of the fascinating things about this
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.660]   is that whether you're talking about pigeons,
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.900]   making these types of choices
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.260]   between a little bit of food now
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.540]   or a little bit of food a minute from now,
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:21.620]   or rats or every like dozens of species of animals tested,
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.980]   including humans.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.860]   The tendency is pretty consistently
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:29.860]   that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.540]   What exponentially means is that every unit of time
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.580]   is associated with the same proportional reduction.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.260]   Every unit of delay is associated with the same,
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.900]   causes the same proportional reduction in value.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.300]   And that's the way the compound interest rate,
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.420]   you know, works, you know,
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:52.780]   every day, you know, you get this sort of,
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.740]   whatever values in there at the beginning of that day,
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.860]   you get this, you know,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.540]   we'll give you this amount of extra money
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.300]   to compensate you for that delay.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:05.500]   But then the way that all animals tend to function
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:09.440]   is of this very different way where the reductions,
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.860]   the initial, that initial delay,
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.660]   so like one day's worth of delay,
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.580]   you see a much stronger discounting rate
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:20.420]   or reduction in value than you do over those.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.980]   So you see the super proportional,
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.180]   then it changes to these lesser rates.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.420]   And so the implication of that,
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.740]   I know I've gone like really into the weeds quantitatively,
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.140]   but what that means is that
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.240]   there's these preference reversals.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.400]   When you have curves of that nature,
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.560]   the decay that's hyperbolic,
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.860]   it maps onto this phenomenon we see
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.700]   both in terms of how people deal with future rewards,
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.780]   but also how perception works.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.200]   When two things are far away,
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.300]   whether it's physical distance
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.780]   or whether in terms of perception
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.820]   or whether it's in terms of time,
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.860]   when you're really far away,
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.700]   the value, the subjective value for that further,
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.980]   that delayed reward is larger.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:13.860]   So for example, like let's say we're talking about 360,
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:19.020]   364 days from now, you can get $9
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.700]   or 365 days a year.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.460]   Now you get $10 and you're like,
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.220]   "Dude, it's a year, no difference.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.040]   I'll take, why not get one more dollar?"
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.500]   You bring that same exact set of choices closer,
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.420]   nothing's changed other than the time to both rewards.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.500]   And it's like, would you rather have $9 today
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.560]   or $10 tomorrow?
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.700]   And plenty of people would say,
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.140]   "Eh, about the same, I'll just go ahead and take it today."
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.980]   So you see this preference reversal.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.980]   And so that's a model of addiction
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:54.980]   in the sense that consistently with true addiction,
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.140]   I would argue, you see this competition
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.660]   between molar and molecular utility.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:05.400]   It's like interpersonal,
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.940]   like within the person competing agents.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.340]   Someone sometimes has control of the bus
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.380]   that wants to do what's good for you in the short term
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.500]   and someone at other times
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.180]   is in control of driving the bus
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.500]   and they wanna do what's good for you in the long term.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.220]   So you tell the, you're trying to quit
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:28.380]   and you see a doctor, you see your 12-step therapist
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.740]   and say, "God, I know this stuff is killing me.
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.660]   I'm really, I'm on the path, I'm done."
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.100]   And that's when you're kind of in their office
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.200]   or wherever it's not around you.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.220]   And then later on that day, your buddy says,
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.640]   "Hey man, I just scored.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.060]   I've got it right here, do you want it?"
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.500]   And that reward is right in front of you.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.000]   That's like bringing those two choices
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.580]   right in front of you and it's like,
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.540]   "Hell yeah, I wanna use."
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.900]   And then you can go through that cycle
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.820]   for like years of the person telling themselves,
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.420]   "I wanna quit."
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.760]   But then other times that same person is saying,
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.740]   "I don't wanna."
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.980]   Functionally, they're saying, "I don't want to,"
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.240]   because they're saying, "Yeah, give me some."
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.180]   - So in the moment, it's very difficult to quit.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.420]   - And this isn't just something,
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.120]   this is something that has huge clinical ramifications
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.420]   with addiction, but it's like all humans do it.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.700]   Anyone who's hit the snooze alarm in the morning,
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   like the night before they realize,
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.620]   "Oh, I gotta get up extra early tomorrow.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.360]   That's what's ultimately better for me.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.120]   So I'm gonna set the alarm for 5 a.m."
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:30.780]   And it goes off at 5 a.m.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.700]   And then, so now those two consequences have come sooner
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.980]   and it's like, "What the hell?"
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.380]   And they hit the snooze alarm.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.540]   And sometimes not just once, but then five minutes later
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.700]   and five minutes later.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.940]   And so, and it's why it's easier to exercise self-control
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.700]   at the grocery store compared to in your fridge.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge,
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.140]   you're gonna more likely yield to temptation
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.060]   than if it is further away.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.540]   - So then, to take a step back to something
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:07.060]   you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:12.140]   Is it from a perspective of the dealers,
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.480]   whether we're talking about cigarettes
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   or maybe venturing slightly into the illegal realm
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.120]   of people who sell drugs illegally,
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.540]   they also have an economics to them
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.080]   that they set prices and all those kinds of things.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.140]   Does addiction allow you to mess
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.820]   with the nature of pricing?
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.460]   Like, so I kind of assume that you meant
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:42.380]   that there's a correlation between things you're addicted to
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.640]   and the inelasticity of the price.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.740]   So you can jack up the price.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.040]   Is there something interesting to be said
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.900]   both for legal drugs and illegal drugs
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   about the kind of price games you can play
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:03.940]   because the consumers of the product are addicted?
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.300]   - Right, I mean, I think you just described it.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.820]   Yeah, you can jack up the price
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.900]   and some people are gonna drop off,
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.540]   but the people, and it's not dichotomous
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.280]   'cause you could just consume less,
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.920]   but some people are gonna consume less
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.520]   and the people that are most addicted are gonna keep,
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.420]   I mean, you see this, they're gonna keep purchasing.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.620]   So you see this with cigarettes.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.060]   And so it's interesting when you interface this with policy.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.300]   Like in one respect, heavily taxing cigarettes
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.140]   is a good thing.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:35.180]   I know it keeps, adolescents are particularly
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.700]   price sensitive, so you definitely,
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.660]   people smoke less and especially kids smoke less
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.140]   when you keep cigarette prices high
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.300]   and you tax the hell out of them.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.780]   But one of the downsides, you've got to balance
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.020]   and keep in mind is that you disproportionately
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.860]   have working class, poor people,
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:55.380]   and then you get into a point where someone's spending
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.660]   a quarter of their paycheck on cigarettes.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.660]   - So they're gonna smoke no matter what.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:01.060]   And basically because they're addicted,
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.100]   they're gonna smoke no matter what
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.380]   and you're just, yeah, you're taxing their existence.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.220]   - Right, so you're making it worse for them.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.540]   If they don't, if they are completely inelastic,
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.820]   you're actually making that person's life worse
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:15.460]   because we know that by interfering
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.380]   with the amount of money they have,
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.420]   you're interfering with the other pro-social,
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.940]   the potential competitors to smoking.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.580]   And we know that when someone's in more impoverished
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.260]   environments and they have less sort of non-drug
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.140]   alternatives, the more likely they're gonna stay addicted.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.780]   So, you know.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.900]   - Is there a data, this is interesting,
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.780]   from a scientific perspective of those same kind of games
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.520]   in illegal drugs?
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.540]   Sort of, because that's where most drug,
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.180]   I mean, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:56.360]   but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.100]   And so, but there's still an economics to them, obviously.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.020]   - Right. - That's the drug war
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:01.860]   and so on.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.220]   Is there data on the setting of prices
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.540]   or like how good are the business people running
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.300]   the selling of drugs that are illegal?
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.460]   Are they all the same kind of rules apply
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.820]   from a behavioral economics perspective?
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.660]   - I think so.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.980]   I mean, they're basically,
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.900]   whether they're crunching the numbers or not,
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.340]   they're basically sensitive to that demand curve
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.700]   and they're doing the same thing that businesses do
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.140]   in a legal market.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.660]   And you wanna sell as much of a product
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.460]   to get as much money,
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.860]   you're looking more at the total income.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.500]   So if you jack the price a little bit,
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.820]   you're gonna get some reduction in consumption,
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.800]   but it may be that the total amount of money
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.380]   that you rake in is gonna be more than,
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.380]   it's gonna overcompensate for that.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.220]   So you're willing to take,
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.220]   okay, I'm gonna lose 10% of my customers,
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.140]   but I'm getting more than enough to compensate from that,
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.740]   from the extra money from the people who still are buying.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.140]   - So I think they're more,
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.420]   and especially when we get to the lower,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.520]   I wouldn't be surprised if people are crunching those numbers
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.500]   and looking at demand curves,
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.060]   maybe at the really high levels of the,
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.180]   up the chain with the cartels and whatnot, I don't know.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.300]   That wouldn't surprise me at all.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.460]   But I think it's probably more implicit
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.220]   at the lower levels where,
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.220]   something you brought up, drug policy,
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.780]   I will say that for years now,
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:24.780]   it's been this kind of unquestioned goal by, for example,
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.740]   the drug czars office in the US
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.660]   to make the price of illegal drugs as high as possible
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.360]   without this kind of nuanced approach that,
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.420]   yeah, if you make, for some people,
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.780]   if you make the price so high,
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.860]   you're actually making things worse.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.820]   I mean, I'm all about reducing the problems
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.740]   associated with drugs and drug addictions.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.460]   And part of that is that,
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.460]   are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:57.540]   But a whole lot is what you get from indirectly
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.740]   and sort of the,
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.100]   both for the individual and for society.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.420]   So like making a poor person
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.860]   who doesn't have enough money for their kids,
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:06.940]   making them even poorer.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.940]   So now you've made their children's future worse
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.540]   because they're growing up in deeper poverty
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.940]   because you've essentially levied a tax
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.780]   onto this person who's heavily addicted.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.460]   But then at the societal level,
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   so everything we know about the drug war
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.220]   in terms of the heavy criminalization
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.380]   and filling up prisons
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.540]   and reducing employment and educational opportunities,
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.740]   which in the big picture,
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.900]   we know are the things that in a free market
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.980]   compete against some of the worst problems of addiction
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.940]   is actually having educational
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.180]   and employment opportunities.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.600]   But when you give someone a felony, for example,
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.380]   you're pretty much guaranteeing
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.340]   they're never gonna go very high on the economic ladder.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:53.820]   And so you're making drugs a better reward
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.140]   for that person's future.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:13:00.500]   - And so this is a quick step into the policy realm.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.820]   And I think for both you and I,
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.100]   I'm not sure you can correct me,
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.020]   but I'm more comfortable into studying
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.300]   the effects of drugs on the human behavior
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.180]   and human psychology versus like policy.
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.820]   It seems like a whole giant mess,
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   but there's some libertarian candidates for president
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.180]   and just libertarian thinkers
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:26.180]   that had a nice thought experiment
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.740]   of possibly legalizing,
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.940]   or spoken about possibly legalizing basically all drugs.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.900]   In your intuition,
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.740]   do you think a world where all drugs are legal
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.660]   is a safer world or a less safe world
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.260]   for the users of those drugs?
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.880]   - It really depends on what we mean by legalization.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.420]   So this is one of my beefs with this,
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.260]   how these things are talked about.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:57.260]   I mean, we have very few completely laissez-faire
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.420]   legal drugs.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:02.340]   So even caffeine is one of the few examples.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.720]   So for example, caffeine and tea and coffee is in that realm.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.420]   Like there's no limits, no one's testing,
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.340]   there's no laws, regulation at any level
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:11.180]   of how much caffeine you're allowed to buy
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.020]   or how much you're not allowed to buy.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.940]   But even like with this Starbucks, like Nitro,
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.040]   there are rules with soda and with canned products,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.480]   you can only put so much.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.320]   - In there, yeah.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.840]   - Yeah, so this is FDA regulated.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.920]   And it's kind of weird because there's a limit to sodas
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.440]   that's not there for energy drinks and other things.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.560]   But so even caffeine,
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.520]   it depends on what product we're talking about.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.040]   Like if you're like no-dose
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.880]   and other caffeine products over the counter,
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.960]   like you can't just put 800 milligrams in there.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.440]   The pills are like one or 200 milligrams.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.960]   And so it's FDA regulated as no-re-counter drug.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.220]   Some of the most dangerous drugs in society,
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.020]   I would say arguably one of the most dangerous
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.660]   classes of drugs are the volatile anesthetics, huffing.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.180]   People huffing gasoline and airplane glue,
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:57.180]   toluene, whatnot, severely damaging to the nervous system.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.500]   Pretty much legal, but there's some regulation
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.040]   in the sense that there's a warning label,
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.900]   like it's illegal to do it for,
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.900]   not that it's necessary, they're busting people for this.
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.620]   But it's against federal law to use this in a way
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.660]   other than intended type of,
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:15.660]   basically saying, yeah, don't huff this.
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.060]   Your paint thinner or whatnot.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.800]   At least keeps people from selling it for that.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.560]   'Cause they're gonna go after that person.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.520]   They're not gonna be able to find
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.180]   the 12-year-old who's huffing.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.980]   So anyway, just as some extreme examples at the end.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.980]   And then even the so-called illegal,
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.500]   like schedule one drugs, psilocybin,
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.500]   we do plenty in terms of schedule two,
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.040]   which is ironically less restrictive than psilocybin,
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.420]   but methamphetamine and cocaine,
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.280]   I've done human research with.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.060]   My research has been legal.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.300]   So they're scheduled compounds,
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.820]   but they're not completely illegal.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.560]   You can do research with them
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.640]   with the appropriate licenses and approval.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.880]   So there really is no such thing.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.420]   And like alcohol, well, it's illegal if you're 12 years old
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.540]   or 18 years old or 20 years old.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.860]   And for anyone, it's illegal to be drinking it
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:06.700]   while you're driving.
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.180]   So there's always a nuance.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.180]   - There's rules, right? - It's not dichotomy.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:12.500]   - And I actually should admit,
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.000]   it's been on my to-do list for a while
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.380]   to buy in Massachusetts some edible,
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.960]   or just buy weed legally.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.700]   Yeah, haven't done that in Massachusetts,
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:24.540]   but this way.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.300]   (Bridget laughs)
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.340]   And I wonder what that experience is like,
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.060]   'cause I think it's fully legal in Massachusetts.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.780]   And so I wonder what legal drugs look like to me.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.480]   I grew up with even weed being like,
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.180]   it's like this forbidden thing.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.580]   Not forbidden, but it's illegal.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.500]   Most people, of course, I never partook,
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.580]   but most people I knew would attain it illegally.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.780]   And so that big switch that's been happening
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.280]   across the country,
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.700]   there's like federal stuff going on
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.380]   to make marijuana legal federally.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.620]   I'm half paying attention.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.740]   - There's some movement there.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.800]   I mean, the House passed a bill
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.060]   that's not gonna be passed by the Senate,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.180]   but yeah, it's progress.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.980]   - There's clearly a change.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.420]   - Right, it's moving in a trend.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.020]   - So that's the example of a drug
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.500]   that used to be illegal
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.900]   and is now becoming more and more and more legal.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:22.780]   So I wonder what cocaine being legal looks like.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:26.060]   What a society with cocaine being legal looks like,
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.620]   the rules around it,
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:34.480]   the processes in which you can consume it in a safer way
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.080]   and be more educated about its consequences,
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.260]   be able to control dose and purity much better,
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:44.120]   be able to get help for overdose.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.820]   I don't know, all those kinds of things.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.560]   It does, in a utopian sense,
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.000]   feel like legalizing drugs
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.480]   at least should be talked about and considered
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.640]   versus keeping them in the dark.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.480]   - I agree.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.200]   - But yeah, so in your sense,
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:10.260]   it's possible that in 50 years we legalize all drugs
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:13.160]   and it makes for a better world.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.300]   - The way I like to talk about it is that,
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.080]   I would say that it's possible
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.400]   and it would probably be a good thing
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.020]   if we regulate all drugs.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.960]   - How would you regulate cocaine, for example?
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.660]   Is there ideas there?
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.780]   - So yeah, and you were already going,
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.940]   where I was going with that,
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.100]   kind of first I described how there's always a nuance
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.180]   and even like the cannabis in Massachusetts,
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.100]   federally illegal.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.700]   So for example, if I was like,
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.900]   and I have colleagues that do cannabis research
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.260]   where they get people high in the lab,
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:43.720]   like you're a federal funded researcher with NIH funds,
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.100]   you can't get that stuff from the dispensary
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.260]   'cause you're breaking a federal law,
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.920]   even though the feds don't have the resources to go after,
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.540]   they don't want the controversy at this point
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.860]   to go after the individual users
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.320]   or even the sellers in those legal states.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.380]   So there's always this nuance,
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.620]   but it's about the right regulation.
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:02.260]   So I think we already know enough that,
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:04.540]   for example, like I think safe injection sites
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:07.100]   for hard drugs makes a lot of sense.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:11.600]   Like I wouldn't want heroin and cocaine
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.100]   at the convenience stores.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.940]   And I don't think,
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.080]   maybe there's some extreme libertarians that want that.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.400]   I think even the folks that identify as libertarians,
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.740]   probably most of them don't, well, I don't know.
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.300]   Like not all of them want that.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.620]   I think that as a form of regulation,
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.580]   like look, if you're using these hard drugs
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.860]   on a regular basis,
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:34.280]   you're putting yourself at risk for lethal overdose.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.940]   You're putting yourself at risk for catching HIV
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.560]   and hepatitis.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.580]   If you're gonna do it, if you're doing it anyway,
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.080]   come to this place where at least you're not like,
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.300]   like pulling the water out of like the puddle
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.380]   on the side of the street.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.140]   - Yeah, so it's done by professionals
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.140]   and those professionals are able to educate you also.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:01.700]   So like a 7-Eleven clerk may not be both capable
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:05.260]   of helping you to inject the drug properly,
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.700]   but also won't be equipped to educate you
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.100]   at the negative consequences, all those kinds of things.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.920]   - That's a huge part of it, the education.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.740]   But then I think with the opioids,
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:18.300]   like the big part of it is just like with naloxone,
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.020]   which is an antagonist, it goes into the receptor.
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.060]   It's called Narcan.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.500]   That's the trade name, but it's what they revive people
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:26.980]   on an opioid overdose.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.220]   That's almost completely effective.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.100]   Like if there's a medical professional there
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.340]   and someone's ODing on an opioid,
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:35.380]   they're virtually guaranteed to live.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.380]   Like that's remarkable that if 100% at the opioid crisis,
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.040]   if all of those people right now that are dying,
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.300]   we're doing that in the presence of a medical professional,
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.060]   like even like a nurse with Narcan,
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.020]   there'd be basically almost no deaths.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.140]   There's always some exceptions,
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:53.180]   but almost no deaths.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.460]   Like that's staggering to me.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.720]   So the idea that people are doing this,
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.220]   that we could have that level of positive effect
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:02.620]   without encouraging the drug.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.100]   And this is where you get into this terrain
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.580]   of like sending the wrong message.
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:09.060]   And it's like, no, you can do that.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.140]   You can say like, we're not encouraging this.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.420]   In fact, probably one of the greatest advertisements
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.900]   for not getting hooked on heroin
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.380]   is like visiting a methadone clinic,
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:19.900]   visiting a safe injection site.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.660]   Like this is not like an advertisement
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.100]   for getting hooked on this drug,
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.700]   but knowing that we can save people.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:27.980]   Now you have a landscape here,
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.140]   'cause a lot of times it's just like supervised injection,
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:32.460]   but you bring your own stuff.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.660]   You bring your own heroin,
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.660]   which could still be dirty
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.840]   and filled with fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives,
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:41.540]   which because of the incredible potency
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:43.500]   and the more difficulty measuring it,
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.140]   and some differences at the receptor,
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.740]   like you may be more likely,
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:51.620]   you are more likely on average to lethally overdose on it.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.060]   So you could, the level that's been more explored
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.220]   in Switzerland is in some places
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.620]   is you actually provide the drug itself
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.180]   and you supervise the injection.
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.140]   So I don't see-- - Do you like that idea?
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.100]   - Yeah, the public health data
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.740]   are completely on the side of,
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.020]   there's really no credible evidence to this.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.780]   If we allow that, we're sending the wrong message
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.580]   and everyone's gonna, I mean, I'm not showing up.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.380]   Like, and it's different by drug.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:19.920]   Like, yeah, you legalize, you set up cannabis shops
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.760]   and some people are gonna say,
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.940]   "It's illegal, I'm gonna go there."
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:23.020]   I don't think a whole lot of people
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.900]   are gonna go to one of these places
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.100]   and say, "I'm gonna shoot up heroin for the first time."
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.380]   And even if like, you know,
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.860]   it's a country of 300 million people.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.260]   Like even if someone does that,
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.860]   you have to compare this to the everyday
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:39.200]   people are dying from opioid overdoses.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.280]   Like people's kids, people's uncles,
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.820]   people's like, these are real lives
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:43.680]   that are being shattered.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.400]   So you just look at that.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.240]   And then the other thing,
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.100]   I know this from having done residential,
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.500]   even like non-treatment research
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.900]   where we just have a cocaine user or something
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.620]   stay on our inpatient ward for a month
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.620]   and you really get to know them.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:58.100]   And sometimes you see, like, oftentimes
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:00.780]   that's the first time this person has had a discussion
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.020]   with a medical professional, any type of professional
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.300]   in their entire life around their drug use.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.260]   Even if they're not looking to quit.
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.420]   And it's like, you know, you could imagine that
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:12.620]   in the safe injection settings where it's like,
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.180]   it might be a year into treatment.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.400]   And they're like, you know, doc,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.440]   I know you're not the cops.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.500]   Like, you really care for me.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.160]   Like, I think I'm ready to try that methadone thing.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.280]   I think I'm really, I think I want to be done.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.720]   - Just having a conversation about it, yeah.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.680]   - Yeah, they get to trust the people
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.000]   and realize that they're there
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.060]   'cause they truly like, they have a compassion,
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.480]   a love for this community, like as human beings.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.480]   And they don't want people to die.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.360]   And you get real human connections.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.940]   And that, and again, like those are the conditions
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.960]   where people are gonna ultimately seek treatment.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:46.800]   And not everyone always will, but you're gonna get that.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.400]   And then you're gonna get people
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.960]   like looking into treatment options sometimes,
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.720]   you know, maybe years into the treatment.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.120]   So it's like, there's just all of these indirect benefits
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.680]   that I think at that level,
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.440]   I don't know if you'd call that legalizing.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.720]   You know, I think again, at least well-regulated.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.600]   - Right, whatever that word is.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.280]   Yeah, well-regulated, but out in the open.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.520]   - Right, minimizing as many harms as we can
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.400]   while not encouraging.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.520]   I mean, we don't encourage people to drink all the,
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.900]   I mean, people die every year from caffeine overdose.
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.400]   Like, you know, and there's different ways to like,
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.920]   you know, just by allowing something
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.080]   doesn't mean we're sending the message that,
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.000]   you know, by saying we're not gonna give you a felony,
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   which is actually often the penalty for psychedelics.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.920]   I just actually testified for the Judiciary Committee,
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.480]   the Senate, the Assembly in New Jersey.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.480]   And just to move psilocybin from a felony to misdemeanor,
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.520]   they use different language in New Jersey, it's weird,
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.200]   but like the equivalent of felony misdemeanor.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.600]   And that was like, two people didn't vote for that
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.360]   on this committee because it was,
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.200]   one of them said it might be sending the wrong message.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.120]   And it's like, a felony, I mean, there's real harms.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.600]   Like that's the scarlet letter the rest of your life.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.240]   You're stuck at the lower ends of the employment ladder.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.020]   You're not gonna get, you know, loans for education,
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:09.000]   all of this, maybe 'cause of a stupid mistake
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.440]   you made once as a 19 year old.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.840]   Doing something that like, you know,
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.280]   a presidential candidate could have done and admitted to
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.880]   and had no problem, you know?
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.480]   - Yeah.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.460]   What drug is the most addictive,
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.520]   the most dangerous in your view?
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.080]   Not maybe, like not technically,
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.360]   like specifically which drug,
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.280]   but more like in our society today,
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.000]   what is a highly problematic drug?
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.920]   We talked about psychedelics not being that addictive.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.100]   On the other flip side of that, you mentioned cocaine.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.380]   Is that the top one?
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.020]   Is there something else that's a concern to you?
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.260]   - It depends, and you've already alluded to this nuance.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.380]   It depends on how you define it.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.780]   If we're talking about on the ground today,
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:58.780]   in, you know, modern society, I'd say nicotine, tobacco.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.980]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.500]   - I mean, in terms of mortality,
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.500]   it kills far more than any other drug known to humankind.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.000]   Four times more than alcohol,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.700]   like a half million deaths in the US every year,
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:18.560]   and about five to six million worldwide due to tobacco.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.580]   That's four times more in the US than alcohol.
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.140]   And if you graph all of the drugs, legal and illegal,
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:28.060]   like, you know, put all of the illegal drugs
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.780]   in like one category on that figure,
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.340]   and you put alcohol and tobacco on that figure,
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.180]   all the illegal drugs combined,
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:39.820]   barely, they're a barely visible blip to this incredible,
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.300]   like, there's no, even all of the opioid epidemic rolled up
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.820]   along with cocaine and everything else,
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.100]   meth, barely shows up compared to tobacco.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.380]   - That's one of those uncomfortable truths
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.820]   that I don't know what to do with.
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.260]   It's like where everybody's freaking out
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.140]   about coronavirus, right?
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.700]   And nobody's freaking-- - The relative.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.540]   - It's all relative.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:03.780]   If you look at the relative thing,
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:06.260]   it's like, well, why aren't we freaking out
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.060]   about cigarettes, which we are, increasingly so,
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.420]   over the, historically speaking, right?
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.260]   - Right.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:14.940]   It's like terrorism versus swimming pools.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.480]   I remember that being back in the,
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.980]   after the war on terror started.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.740]   It's like, yeah, there's not even comparison.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:25.380]   - Okay, so, you know, that's a little sobering truth there.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.940]   'Cause I was thinking like cocaine,
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.840]   I was thinking about all of these hard drugs,
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.340]   but the reality is relatively nicotine is the big one.
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.460]   - And he didn't ask about mortality or deaths.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.420]   He asked about addiction.
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.540]   But that really is hard to evaluate.
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.620]   It gets into those nuances I spoke of before
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.140]   about there's not a unidimensional way
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.280]   to measure reinforcement.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.060]   It kind of depends on the situation
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.780]   and what measure we're looking at.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:55.020]   But, you know, more people have access to tobacco.
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:58.580]   And I'm not advocating that we make it an illegal drug.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.900]   I think that would be a horrible mistake.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.060]   Although there is a very credible push
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:07.660]   to mandate the reduction of nicotine in cigarettes,
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:10.900]   which I have, most scientists that study it are for it.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.100]   I think there's some real dangers there
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.180]   'cause I see that in the broader history of drug use.
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:19.340]   It's like, when has drug prohibition worked,
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.300]   broadly speaking?
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:25.300]   And it's, to me, that path would only make sense
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.420]   in very good conjunction with e-cigarettes,
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.580]   which, once they're fully regulated, can be a safer,
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.300]   not safe, but much safer alternative.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.980]   And if we tax the hell out of e-cigarettes
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.700]   and ban every attractive feature,
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.840]   like flavors and everything,
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.980]   then that's gonna push people to a black market
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.780]   if they can't get the real thing from real cigarettes.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.860]   Like, some people will just quit straight out.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.380]   But I think with the regulators
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:53.960]   and with a lot of scientists that study tobacco,
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.920]   like myself, it's a big part still of what I study,
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.960]   they're not used to thinking about tobacco really
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.800]   as a drug, largely speaking,
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.540]   in terms of, for example, the history of prohibition.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:10.000]   And I think of, we already know there's an illicit market,
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.680]   a black market for tobacco to get around taxes.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.620]   I mean, and for selling even loose cigarettes.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:18.520]   That's what initially caused in Staten Island
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.880]   the police to approach, was it Eric Garland
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.480]   who was selling loose cigarettes and he got choked out?
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.200]   I mean, the thing that caused that police contact
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.920]   was he was selling, well, I think reported
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.320]   to sell individual cigarettes for like,
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.280]   you can sell them for quarter, happens in Baltimore.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.400]   And it's like, that's technically illegal.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.160]   But are you not gonna have massive boats
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.260]   of supplies coming over from China and elsewhere
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:47.260]   of real deal cigarettes if you ban the sale of nicotine?
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:49.960]   Like, it's obviously gonna happen.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.720]   And you have to weigh that against,
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.200]   you're gonna create a black market
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.600]   to one size or another.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.520]   - And your intuition, that really hasn't worked
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.840]   throughout the history when we've tried it.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.900]   - Right, but I see a potential path forward,
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.800]   but only if it's well, if it's done
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.000]   in conjunction with e-cigarettes.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.320]   - If there's a clear alternative
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.560]   that's a positive alternative
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.560]   that it kind of stares the population
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:14.640]   towards an alternative, yeah.
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.600]   - The difference here, the unique thing
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.040]   that could be taken advantage of here
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.760]   is nicotine is by and large not what causes the harm.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.000]   It's the aromatic hydrocarbons,
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.320]   it's the carcinogens in tobacco,
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.460]   it's burning tobacco smoke, it's not the nicotine.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:34.120]   So it's not like alcohol prohibition
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.640]   where you couldn't create the oduls,
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.720]   the near beer is not gonna have the alcohol.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.920]   And so people aren't, like,
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:45.200]   here you do have the possibility of giving another medium,
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.040]   the ability to deliver the drug,
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.840]   which still aren't, to a lot of people,
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.320]   isn't preferred to the tobacco.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.200]   But nonetheless, again, if you over-regulate those
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.400]   and make them less attractive,
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.760]   like if you aren't thoughtful about the nicotine limits
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.840]   and thoughtful about whether you're allowing flavors
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.440]   and everything, and if you over-tax them,
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.440]   you're actually decreasing the ability
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.680]   to compete with the more dangerous products.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:11.080]   So I feel like there is a potential path forward,
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.440]   but I don't have a lot of confidence
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:17.040]   that that's gonna be done in a thoughtful, analytical way.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.200]   And I'm afraid that it could decrease the,
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.160]   increase the black market, cause all of the harms.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.600]   Like every other drug, we're moving away
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:28.400]   from the prohibition model slowly,
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.440]   but the big barge ship is making a very slow turn.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:35.000]   And like, okay, we really had to step back
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.800]   and question if we went with nicotine, tobacco,
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.600]   are we moving into that direction?
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.640]   Like, big picture.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.240]   - It doesn't quite make sense.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:50.240]   You've done a study on cocaine and sexual decision-making.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.360]   Can you explain? (laughs)
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.960]   Can you explain the findings?
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.040]   I mean, in a broad sense,
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:05.440]   how do you do a study that involves cocaine?
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.440]   And the other, how do you do a study
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.080]   involving sexual decision-making?
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.720]   And then how do you do a study that combines both?
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.040]   - Yeah, sex and drugs too.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.520]   I'm just missing the rock and roll.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.400]   It's like the two controversial,
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.800]   rock and roll isn't very controversial anymore.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.400]   Yeah, so the cocaine, lots of hoops to jump through.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.440]   You gotta have a lot of medical support.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.640]   You gotta be at a, basically at an institution,
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.440]   a research unit like I'm at that has a long history
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.320]   and the ability to do that.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:40.760]   And you get ethics approval, get FDA approval,
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.680]   but it's possible.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.960]   And whenever you're dealing with something like cocaine,
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.600]   you would never wanna give that to a not,
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.320]   someone who hasn't already used cocaine.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.880]   And you wanna make sure you're not giving it
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.400]   to someone who's an active user who wants to quit.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.840]   So the idea is like, okay,
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.240]   if you're using this type of drug anyway,
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.560]   and you're really sure you're not looking to quit,
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:04.280]   hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.520]   so we can at least learn something.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.120]   And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.080]   and it'll reduce the harms of cocaine.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.360]   So there's hoops to jump through.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.680]   With the sexual decision-making,
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.120]   I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model of,
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.840]   I applied delayed discounting to what we talked about
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.480]   earlier, the now versus later,
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.400]   that kind of decision-making that goes along with addiction.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   I applied that to condom use decisions.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.700]   And I've done, probably published about 20 or so papers
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.200]   with this and different drugs.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.160]   - So the primary metric is whether you do
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.480]   or don't use a condom?
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:43.920]   - Right, so this is using hypothetical decision-making,
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.700]   but I've published some studies looking at,
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.640]   showing a tight correspondence to self-reported
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.720]   in correlational studies to self-reported behavior.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.220]   - So this is like, so,
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:59.880]   like how do you, did you do a questionnaire kind of thing?
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.360]   - Right, so it's not quite a questionnaire,
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   but it's a behavioral task requiring them to respond to.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.600]   So you show pictures of a bunch of individuals
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.640]   and it's kind of like one of these fun behavioral,
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.840]   like in a lot of them you get like numbers are boring,
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.440]   but it's like, okay, hot or not,
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.720]   like which of these 60 people
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.560]   would you have a one night stand with?
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.520]   Men, women, so pick whatever you like,
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520]   a little bit of this, a little bit of that,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.920]   whatever you're into, it's all variety there.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.160]   Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.520]   Who do you think is the,
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.400]   the one you most wanna have sex with the least?
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.120]   Who do you think's most likely to have an STI
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.880]   or least likely a sexually transmitted disease by STI?
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.600]   And then you could do certain decision making questions.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.840]   So what I've done is asked,
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.240]   say this person, you read a vignette,
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.320]   this person wants to have sex with you,
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.080]   now you've met them, you get along.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.300]   Casual sex scenario, like a one night stand.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.020]   With a condom's available,
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.800]   just rate your likelihood from one to 100
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.040]   on this kind of scale, would you use it?
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:57.880]   - Would you use a condom?
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:59.800]   - But then you can change your scenario to say,
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.720]   okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.920]   to use a condom.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.600]   So the choice is now, instead of using condom versus not,
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.320]   in terms of your likelihood scale,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.960]   now it ranges from have sex now without a condom,
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.320]   versus on the other end of the scale is wait five minutes
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.380]   to have sex with a condom.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.600]   So you rate your likelihood
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.400]   of where your behavior would be along that continuum.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.780]   And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.920]   What about three hours?
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.960]   What about, you know, what about 24 hours?
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.160]   - Misunderstanding.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.800]   Now without a condom or five minutes later with a condom?
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.640]   - Right.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   - So what's supposed to be the preference for the person?
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:44.200]   There's a lot of factors coming into play, right?
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:49.520]   There's like pleasure, personal preference,
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.520]   and then there's also the safety.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.320]   Those are two, like, are those competing objectives?
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.120]   - Right, and so we do get at that
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.720]   through some individual measures.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.160]   And this task is more of a face valid task
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.640]   where there's a lot underneath the hood.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.720]   So for most people,
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.560]   sex with the condom is the better reward.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.840]   But underneath the hood of that is,
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.520]   just at the purely physical level,
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.640]   they'd rather have sex without the condom.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:14.520]   It's gonna feel better.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.720]   - What do you mean by reward?
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.720]   Like when they calculate their trajectory through life
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.380]   and try to optimize it,
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:24.480]   then sex with a condom is a good idea?
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.880]   - Well, it's really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.320]   Presumably that's the case,
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.760]   that there's, but it's measured by like,
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.200]   what would you, really that first question
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.480]   where there is no delay,
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.080]   most people say they would be at the higher end scale.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.080]   A lot of times, 100%,
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.760]   they said they would definitely use a condom.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.880]   Not everybody, and we know that's the case.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:46.200]   See, it's like that some people don't like condoms.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.120]   Some people say, yeah, I wanna use a condom,
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.000]   but a quarter of the time ended up not
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.880]   because I guess getting lost in the passion of the moment.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.960]   So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people,
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.640]   so behaviorally speaking,
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.080]   at least for a large number of people in many circumstances,
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.960]   condom use is a reinforcer just because people do it.
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:07.040]   Like, you know, why are they doing it?
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.200]   They're not because it makes the sex feel better,
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.040]   but because it makes that,
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.040]   it allows for at least the same general reward,
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.920]   even if actually, even if it feels a little bit,
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.400]   not as good, you know, with the condom,
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.000]   nonetheless, they get most of the benefit
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.680]   without the concurrent, oh my gosh,
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.920]   there's this risk of either unwanted pregnancy
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.960]   or getting HIV or way more likely than HIV,
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.760]   you know, herpes, you know, in general rewards, et cetera,
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.400]   all the lovely ones.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.880]   And we've actually done research saying like,
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.640]   where we gauge the probability of these individual,
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.680]   different STIs, and it's like, what's the heavy hitter
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.600]   in terms of what people are using to judge,
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.280]   you know, to evaluate whether they're gonna use a condom.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.520]   - So that's why the condom use is the delayed thing,
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.240]   five minutes or more. - Right.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.360]   - And then, yeah, because that's the--
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.320]   - Which would normally be the larger later reward,
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.000]   like the $10 versus the nine, it's like the $10,
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.800]   which is counterintuitive if you just think
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.360]   about the physical pleasure.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.160]   - So that's a good thing to measure.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   So condom use is a really good concrete quantifiable thing
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.640]   that you can use in a study,
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:15.960]   and then you can add a lot of different elements,
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:18.400]   like the presence of cocaine and so on.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.640]   - Yeah, you can get people loaded on like any number
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.840]   of drugs like cocaine, alcohol, and methamphetamine
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:24.960]   are the three that I've done and published on.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.800]   And it's interesting that--
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.920]   - These are fun studies, man.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:32.240]   - Right, I love to get people loaded in a safe context,
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.080]   and like, but to really, it started,
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.360]   like there was some early research with alcohol.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.040]   I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting,
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.320]   but it's like all of these drugs are fascinating.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.840]   The fact that all of these are keys that unlock
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.560]   a certain psychological experience in the head.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.080]   And so there was this work with alcohol that showed
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.480]   that it didn't affect those monetary
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.160]   delay discounting decisions,
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.960]   $9 now versus $10 later.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.040]   And I'm like getting people drunk.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.800]   And I thought to myself, are you telling me
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.160]   that getting someone, that people being drunk
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.320]   does not cause people, at least sometimes,
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.840]   to choose what's good for them in the short term
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:13.800]   at the expense of what's good for them in the long term.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:14.960]   It's like, bullshit.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.320]   But in what context does that happen?
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.800]   So that's something that inspired me
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.080]   to go in this direction of like, aha,
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.240]   risky sexual decisions is something they do
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.120]   when they're drunk.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.280]   They don't necessarily go home,
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.600]   and even though some people have gambling problems
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.880]   and alcohol interacts with that,
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.800]   the most typical thing is not for people to go home,
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.000]   log on and change their allocation
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.560]   in their retirement account or something like that.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.480]   - But they're more likely, risky sexual decisions,
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.520]   they're more likely to not wait the five minutes
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.360]   for the condom and instead go no condom now.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.680]   - Right, that's a big effect, and we see that.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:53.320]   And interestingly, we do not see,
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.240]   with those different drugs, we don't see an effect
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.320]   if we just look at that zero delay condition.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.200]   In other words, the condom's right there waiting to be used.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.760]   Would you, how likely are you to use it?
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760]   You don't see it.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.720]   I mean, people are by and large gonna use the condom.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.040]   So, and that's the way most of this research
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.480]   outside of behavioral economics
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.520]   that just looked at condom use decisions,
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.240]   very little of which has ever actually administered
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.440]   the drugs, which is another unique aspect.
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:20.640]   But they usually just look at assuming the condom is there.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.680]   But this is more using behavioral economics to delve in
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:24.640]   and model something that,
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.400]   and I've done survey research on this,
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.200]   modeling what actually happens.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.760]   Like, you meet someone at a laundromat,
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.600]   like you weren't planning on, you know,
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.600]   one thing leads to another, they live around the corner,
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:41.080]   these things, you know, and like we did one survey
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.320]   with men who have sex with men
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.200]   and found that 25% of them, 24%,
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.840]   about a quarter, reported in the last six months
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.440]   that they had unprotected anal intercourse,
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.280]   which is the most risky in terms of sexually transmitted
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.480]   infection in the last six months in a situation
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.880]   where they would have used a condom,
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.680]   but they simply didn't use one just 'cause they didn't have
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.080]   one on them.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.040]   So this, to me, it's like, if unless we delve into this
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.480]   and understand this, these suboptimal conditions,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.200]   we're not gonna fully address the problem.
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.680]   There's plenty of people that say, yep,
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.800]   condom use is good, I use it a lot of the time.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.400]   You know, it's like, where is that failing?
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.000]   And it's under these suboptimal conditions,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.480]   which in frank, if you think about it,
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.520]   it's like most of the case.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.960]   Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy,
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:31.160]   someone's like, do you got a condom?
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.120]   Eh, no.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.240]   It's like, do they break the action and take 10 minutes
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:38.560]   to go to the convenience store or whatever?
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.680]   Maybe everything's closed,
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.480]   maybe they gotta wait till tomorrow.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.960]   - And there's something to be studied there on the,
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.920]   it just seems like an unfortunate set of circumstances.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.680]   Like, what's the solution to that?
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:57.840]   I mean, what's the psychology that needs to be
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:00.960]   like taken apart there?
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.960]   Because it just seems like that's the way of life.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.120]   We don't expect the things to happen.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.360]   Are we supposed to expect them better,
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:11.680]   to be self-aware enough about our calculations?
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:15.880]   Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:20.280]   as a kind of thing that we need to understand
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:25.560]   how we humans evaluate the cost of that.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.440]   - I think in terms of like how we use this to help people,
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.680]   it's mostly on the environment side rather than on the--
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:34.560]   - Individual side, cool.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.240]   - Yeah, although those interact.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.320]   So it's like, in one sense, if you're,
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.800]   especially if you're gonna be drinking
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.400]   or using another substance that is associated
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.440]   with a stimulant, alcohol and stimulants
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.280]   go along with risky sex.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.320]   Good to be aware that you might make decisions
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.960]   just to tell yourself you might make a decision
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.120]   that you wouldn't have made in your sober state.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.160]   And so, hey, throwing a condom in the purse,
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.900]   in the pocket might be a good idea.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.400]   I think at the environmental level, just more condom,
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.680]   I mean, it highlights what we know
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.840]   about just making condoms widely available.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.400]   - Something that I'd like to do is like
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.480]   reinforcing condom use.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.480]   So just getting people used to carrying a condom
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:20.040]   everywhere they go, 'cause it's such a,
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.760]   once it's in someone's habit,
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.600]   if they are say like a young single person
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:27.640]   and they occasionally have unprotected sex,
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.760]   like training those people,
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.400]   like what if you got a text message once every few days
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.080]   saying, "Ah, if you show me a,
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.400]   "send back a photo of a condom,
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:38.360]   "within a minute you get a reward of $5."
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.960]   You could shape that up like,
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.760]   it's a process called contingency management,
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:44.680]   it's basically just straight up operant reinforcement.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.720]   You could shape that up with no problem.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.800]   I mean, those procedures of contingency management,
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.900]   giving people systematic rewards is like,
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:54.200]   for example, the most powerful way
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:57.600]   to reduce cocaine use in addicted people.
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.760]   - Is what?
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:05.000]   - By saying, "If you show me a negative urine for cocaine,
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.560]   "I'm gonna give you a monetary reward."
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.360]   And like that has huge effects
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360]   in terms of decreasing cocaine use.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.560]   If that can be that powerful
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.560]   for something like stopping cocaine use,
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.520]   how powerful could that be
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.160]   for shaping up just carrying a condom?
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.080]   'Cause the primary, unlike cocaine use,
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.440]   here we're not saying you can't have the main reward,
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.400]   like you could still have sex,
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.640]   and you can even have sex in the way
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.160]   that you tell yourself you'd rather do it
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:30.720]   if a condom is available.
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.200]   You know, so, you know, like, you're not, you know,
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.260]   it's, relatively speaking, it's way easier
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:40.160]   than like not using cocaine if you like using cocaine.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.380]   It's just basically getting in the habit
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:43.240]   of carrying a condom.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.080]   So that's just one idea of like--
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.120]   - There could be also the capitalistic solutions
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.400]   of like there could be a business opportunity
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.760]   for like a DoorDash for condoms.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.600]   - Oh yeah.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.920]   - Like delivery.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.120]   - I thought about this with--
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.240]   - Within five minute delivery of a condom
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.560]   at any location, like Uber for condoms.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.200]   - I've thought about it, not with condoms,
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:03.240]   but a very similar line of thinking,
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:06.040]   a line that you're going into in terms of Uber
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.360]   and people getting drunk when they intend,
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.240]   they enter the bar planning to have one or two,
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.560]   they ended up having five or six,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.840]   and it's like, okay, yeah, you can take the cab home,
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.220]   the Uber home, but you've left your car there,
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:19.320]   it might get towed, you might like,
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.880]   there's also the hassle of just, you know,
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.440]   you wanna wake up tomorrow with your hangover
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.600]   and forget about it and move on.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.320]   And I think a lot of people in their situation,
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.820]   they're like, screw it, I'm gonna take the risk,
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:29.920]   just get it, you know.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.120]   What if you had an Uber service where two,
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:38.040]   you know, you have a car come out with two drivers,
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:45.120]   and one of them, two sober drivers, obviously,
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.660]   and the person, the one driver drops off the other
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:54.660]   that then drives you home in their car, in your car.
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:58.000]   So that you can, I mean, I think a lot of people
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.160]   would pay 50 bucks, it's gonna be more than a regular Uber,
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.520]   but it's like, it's gonna be done, I got the money,
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:06.380]   I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight,
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:09.240]   like, just get the damn thing done,
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.100]   tomorrow I'm done with it, I wake up,
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:12.960]   my car's in front of my house.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.840]   I think that would be, I think someone could,
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:15.960]   I'm not gonna open that business,
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:18.540]   so if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that,
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.760]   like, I think it could help a lot of people.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:23.520]   - Yeah, definitely, and Uber itself, I would say,
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.440]   helped a huge amount of people,
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.040]   just making it easy to make the decision of going home,
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.560]   not driving yourself.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.320]   - I read about in Austin, where they,
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.200]   I don't know where it's at now,
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.280]   where they outlawed Uber for a while,
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.080]   you know, because of the whole taxicab union type thing,
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.040]   and how just, yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.880]   that were used to Uber
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.360]   that now didn't have a cheap alternative.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.840]   - So, just, we didn't exactly mention,
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:54.240]   you've done a lot of studies in sexual decision making
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.200]   with different drugs.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.560]   Is there some interesting insights or findings
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:03.120]   on the difference between the different drugs?
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.840]   So, I think you said meth as well, so cocaine.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.840]   Is there some interesting characteristics
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.040]   about decision making that these drugs alter
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.680]   versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.800]   - I think, and there's much more to study with this,
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:20.480]   but I think the biggie there is that the stimulants,
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.480]   they create risky sex by really increasing
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.280]   the rewarding value of sex.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.680]   Like, if you talk to people that are real,
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.480]   especially that are hooked on stimulants,
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.360]   one of the biggies is like,
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.120]   sex on coke or meth is like so much better
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.760]   than sex without, and that's a big part of what,
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.960]   why they have trouble quitting,
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.760]   'cause it's so tied to their sex life.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.360]   - So, it's not that your decision making is broken,
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.840]   it's just that you, well, you allocate--
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.560]   - It's a different aspect of their decision,
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.860]   yeah, on the reward side.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.400]   I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.840]   It's like, alcohol is really good at reducing the ability
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.280]   of a delayed punisher to have an effect on current behavior.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.000]   In other words, there's this bad thing
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.240]   that's gonna happen tomorrow, or a week from now,
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:06.120]   or 20 years from now.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.240]   Being drunk is a really good way,
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.640]   and you see this in like rats making decisions.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.840]   You know, a high dose of alcohol makes someone
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.700]   less sensitive to those consequences.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:20.160]   So, I think that's the lever that's being hit with alcohol,
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.780]   and it's more just increasing the rewarding value of sex
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:26.960]   by the psychostimulants on that side.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.920]   We actually found that it, and it was amazing,
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.240]   'cause like hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.000]   have been spent by NIH to study the connection
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.920]   between cocaine and HIV.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.520]   Like, we ran the first study on my grant
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:41.800]   that like actually just gave people cocaine
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.960]   under double blind conditions, and showed that like,
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.560]   yeah, when people are on coke,
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.460]   like their ratings of sexual desire,
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:50.320]   even though they're not in a sexual situation,
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.420]   yeah, you show them some pictures,
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:53.280]   but you're just saying they're horny.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.480]   Like, you get subjective ratings
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:57.600]   about like how much sexual desire you're feeling right now.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.480]   People get horny when they're on stimulants.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.380]   And a lot of people say, duh,
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:04.800]   if they really know these drugs.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.000]   - But that's a rigorous study that's in the lab
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.360]   that shows like, there's a plot.
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.600]   - Right, the dose effects of that, the time course of that.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.840]   - Yeah, it's not just--
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.040]   - Can you please tell me there's a paper with a plot
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:21.040]   that shows dose versus evaluation of like horniness?
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.440]   - Yeah, we didn't say horniness,
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.760]   we said sexual arousal.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.600]   - Sexual? - Yeah, basically, yeah.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:25.600]   - There's a plot?
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.600]   I'm gonna find this plot.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.680]   - Right, well, I'll send it to you.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.260]   There was one headline from some publicity on the work
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:36.400]   that said, "Horny cocaine users don't use condoms,"
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.240]   or something like that.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.060]   (laughing)
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.360]   - You gotta love journalism.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.400]   - I wouldn't have put it that way,
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.600]   but like, yeah, that's right on.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.800]   - I guess that's what it finds.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:48.000]   So you've published a bunch of studies on psychedelics.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000]   Is there some especially favorite,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.520]   insightful findings from some of these
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.360]   that you could talk about?
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:01.640]   Maybe favorite studies or just something that pops to mind
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.640]   in terms of both the goals and like the major insights gained
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:09.520]   and maybe the side little curiosities
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.440]   that you discovered along the way?
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.920]   - Yeah, I think of the work with using psilocybin
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.360]   to help people quit smoking.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   I mean, we've talked about smoking
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.520]   being such a serious addiction.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.120]   And so what inspired me to get into that
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.240]   was just kind of having behavioral psychologies
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.400]   my primary lens,
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.400]   sort of this sort of radical, empirical basis of,
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:41.320]   I'm really interested in the mystical experience
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.000]   and all of these reports, very interested.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.520]   And, but at the same time, I'm like, okay,
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.560]   let's get down to some behavior change
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.040]   and something that we can record,
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:56.920]   like quantitatively verify biologically.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.160]   - So find all kinds of negative behaviors
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.480]   that people practice and see if we can turn those
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:03.320]   into positive or change the behavior.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:06.320]   - Right, like really change it, not just people saying,
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.120]   which again is interesting, I'm not dismissing it,
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.200]   but folks that say my life has turned around,
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.200]   I feel this has completely changed me.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.760]   It's like, yep, that's good.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.680]   All right, let's see if we can harness that
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:21.480]   and test that into something that's real behavior change.
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.320]   You know what I mean?
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:23.200]   It's quantifiable.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.000]   It's like, okay, you've been smoking for 30 years.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.680]   You know, like that's a real thing.
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.400]   And you've tried a dozen times, like seriously to quit
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.600]   and you haven't been able to long-term, like, okay.
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.640]   And if you quit, like we'll ask you and I'll believe you,
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.200]   but I don't trust everyone reading the paper to believe you.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.680]   So we're gonna have you pee in a cup and we'll test that.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.120]   We'll have you blow into this little machine
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.560]   that measures carbon monoxide and we'll test that.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:48.640]   So multiple levels of biological verification.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.480]   - Nice.
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.400]   - Like now we're getting like,
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.960]   to me that's where the rubber meets the road
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.520]   in terms of like therapeutics.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.640]   It's like, can we really shift behavior?
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:58.560]   And since, and so much as we've talked about
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.440]   my other scientific work outside of psychedelics
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.960]   is about understanding addiction and drug use.
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.600]   So it's like, you know, looking at addiction,
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.320]   it's a no brainer and smoking is just a great example.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.000]   And so back to your question,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.040]   like we've had really high success rates.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.240]   I mean, it really, it rivals anything
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.800]   that's been published in the scientific literature.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.360]   The caveat is that, you know,
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.960]   that's based on our initial trial of only 15 people,
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:23.480]   but extremely high long-term success rates,
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.440]   80% at six months per smoke-free.
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.320]   - So can we discuss the details?
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.840]   So first of all, which psychedelic are we talking about?
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.360]   And maybe can you talk about the 15 people
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.240]   and how the study ran and what you found?
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.840]   - Yeah, yeah, so the drug we're using is psilocybin
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.480]   and we're using moderately high
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.960]   and high doses of psilocybin.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.880]   And I should say this about most of our work.
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.600]   These are not kind of museum level doses.
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.000]   In other words, nothing,
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.800]   even big fans of psychedelics wanna take
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:57.320]   and go to a concert or go to the museum.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.400]   If someone's at Burning Man on this type of dose,
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:02.200]   like they're probably gonna wanna find their way
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:05.200]   back to their tent and zip up and hunker down for,
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.640]   you know, not be around strangers.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:09.720]   Yeah. - And by the way,
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:14.680]   the delivery method, so psilocybin is mushrooms, I guess.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:19.160]   What's the usual, is it edible?
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.400]   Is there some other way?
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.160]   Like how is people supposed to think about
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:25.120]   the correct dosing of these things?
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:28.260]   'Cause I've heard that it's hard to dose correctly.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.480]   - That's right.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.680]   So in our studies, we use the pure compound psilocybin.
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.760]   So it's a single molecule, you know, a bunch of molecules.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.300]   And we give them a capsule with that in it.
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:44.880]   And so it's just, you know, a little capsule they swallow.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:49.880]   What people, when psilocybin is used outside of research,
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.960]   it's always in the context of mushrooms.
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.140]   'Cause they're so easy to grow.
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:56.240]   There's no market for synthetic psilocybin.
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.080]   There's no reason for that to pop up.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000]   The high dose that we use in research is 30 milligrams,
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.080]   body weight adjusted.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.200]   So if you're a heavier person,
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.600]   it might be like 40 or even 50 milligrams.
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:18.480]   We have some data that, based on that data,
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.160]   we're actually moving into like getting away
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:22.440]   from the body weight adjusting of the dose
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.720]   and just giving an absolute dose.
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.080]   It seems like there's no justification
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:28.160]   for the body weight based dosing, but I digress.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.920]   Generally 30, 40 milligrams, it's a high dose.
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.980]   And based on average, even though, as you alluded to,
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.840]   there's variability, which gets people into some trouble
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.520]   in terms of mushrooms, like psilocybin cubensis,
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.540]   which is the most common species
[01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.960]   in the illicit market in the US.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:47.800]   This is about equivalent to five dried grams,
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.680]   which is right at about where,
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:54.680]   right where McKenna and others, they call it a heroic dose.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.400]   This is not hanging out with your friends,
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.200]   going to the concert again.
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:03.240]   So this is a real deal dose, even to people that really,
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.040]   just even to psychonauts.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.520]   And we've even had a number of studies.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:07.560]   - Psychonauts?
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.840]   - Yeah, people that, yeah, like astronaut or cosmonaut.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.400]   - Psychonauts, great terms. - For psychedelics.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.080]   Yeah, going as far out as possible.
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.240]   - But even for them, even for those
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:21.160]   who've flown to space before.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.640]   - Right, right, they're like, "Holy shit,
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:25.840]   "I didn't know the orbit would be that far out."
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.680]   Or, "I escaped the orbit,
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:30.420]   "I was in interplanetary space there."
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.560]   (laughs)
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.040]   - So these folks, the 15 folks in the study,
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.460]   there's not a question of dose being too low
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:40.240]   to truly have an impact.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.680]   - Right, right, very, out of hundreds of volunteers
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.760]   over the years, we've only seen a couple of people
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:48.680]   where there was a mild effect of the 30 milligrams.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:51.520]   And who knows, that person's their serotonin,
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:55.280]   they might have lesser density of serotonin 2A receptors
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:56.380]   or something, we don't know.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.480]   But it's extremely rare.
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:00.680]   For most people, this is like something interesting
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.520]   is gonna happen, put it that way.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:04.360]   - Speaking of Joe Rogan, I think that Jamie,
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:09.360]   his producer, is immune to psychedelics.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.040]   So maybe he's a good recruit for the study to test.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:13.880]   - So that's interesting.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:16.040]   Now, I'm not, the caveat is I'm not encouraging
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:19.140]   anything illicit, but just theoretically,
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:21.800]   my first question as a behavioral pharmacologist
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.360]   is increase the dose.
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:24.480]   (laughs)
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.320]   Like really?
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.240]   - Nobody's immune.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.160]   - I'm not telling Jamie to do that, but okay.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.040]   You're taking the same amount that friends might be taking.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.900]   - But he was also referring to the psychedelic effects
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:38.720]   of edible marijuana, which is,
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.720]   is there rules on dosage for marijuana?
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:47.680]   Is there limits?
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.520]   Like places where it's, this all goes,
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:52.040]   it probably is state by state, right?
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.440]   - It is, but most, they've gone that direction
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.760]   in states that didn't initially have these rules
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.840]   have now have them.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:00.720]   So it's like, you'll get, I think, five, 10,
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.720]   I think five or 10 milligrams of THC being a common,
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.920]   and this is an important thing,
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.280]   like where they've moved from not being allowed to say,
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.160]   like have a whole candy bar and have each of the eight
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.240]   or 10 squares in the candy bar being 10 milligrams,
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.560]   but it's like, no, the whole thing,
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.160]   because like, someone gets a candy bar,
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.880]   they're eating the freaking candy bar.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.080]   And it's like, unless you're a daily cannabis user,
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:26.740]   if you take 100 milligrams, it's like,
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:30.880]   that's what could lead to a bad trip for someone.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.560]   And it's like, a lot of these people, it's like,
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.160]   oh, I used to smoke a little weed in college,
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:38.320]   they might say, they're visiting Denver for a business trip,
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:39.160]   and they're like, why not?
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.320]   Let's give it a shot, you know?
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:41.840]   And they're like, oh, I don't wanna smoke something
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:44.440]   'cause it's gonna, so I'm gonna be safer with this edible.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.760]   And they like consume this massive, you know,
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.800]   but there's huge tolerance.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.240]   So a regular, like for someone who's smoking weed every day,
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.680]   they might take five milligrams
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.680]   and kind of hardly feel anything.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.440]   And they may really need something like 30, 40, 50
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:02.160]   milligrams to have a strong effect.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:06.200]   But yeah, so they've evolved in terms of the rules
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:11.120]   about like, okay, what constitutes a dose, you know,
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:13.280]   which is why you see less big candy bars and more,
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:15.360]   or if it is a whole candy bar,
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:17.960]   you're only getting a smaller dose, like 10 milligrams or,
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:20.440]   yeah, 'cause that is where people get in trouble
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.360]   more often with edibles.
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:25.880]   - Yeah, except Joey Diaz, which I've heard.
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:27.520]   That's definitely somebody I wanna talk to.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:30.120]   Out of the crazy comedians I wanna talk to as well.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:33.680]   Anyway, so yeah, the study of the 15
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:36.080]   and the dose not being a question.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:39.200]   So like, what was the recruitment based on?
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:44.200]   What was the, like, how did the study get conducted?
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:47.000]   - Yeah, so the recruitment, I really liked this fact.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.480]   It wasn't people that, you know, largely were,
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:51.680]   you know, we were honest about what we were studying,
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:54.760]   but for most people, it was, they were in the category
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:57.520]   of like, you know, not particularly interested
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.920]   in psychedelics, but more of like,
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.920]   they wanna quit smoking, they've tried everything,
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.760]   but the kitchen sink.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.520]   And this sounds like the kitchen sink.
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:06.360]   (laughing)
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:08.400]   You know, it's like, well, it's Hopkins,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.560]   so, you know, thinking of that,
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:11.820]   sounds like it's safe enough.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:13.640]   So like, what the hell, let's give it a shot.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:15.960]   Like, most of them were in that category,
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.880]   which I really, you know, I appreciate,
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:22.120]   'cause it's more of a test, you know,
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:27.040]   of, yeah, just like a better model of what,
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.040]   if these are approved as medicines,
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.520]   like what you're gonna have the average participant,
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:34.200]   you know, be like.
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:37.600]   And so the therapy involves a good amount
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.320]   of non-psilocybin sessions, so preparatory sessions,
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.200]   like eight hours of getting to know the person,
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.000]   like the two people who are gonna be their guides
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.900]   or the person in the room with them during the experience,
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:52.160]   having these discussions with them
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.840]   where you're both kind of rapport building,
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.840]   just kind of discussing their life, getting to know them,
[01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.000]   but then also telling them, preparing them
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.480]   about the psilocybin experience,
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.040]   oh, it could be scary in this sense,
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.800]   but here's how to handle it, trust, let go, be open.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.600]   And also during that preparation time,
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:09.880]   preparing them to quit smoking,
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.240]   using really standard bread and butter techniques
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.800]   that can all fall under the label,
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.900]   typically of the cognitive behavioral therapy,
[02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:19.840]   just stuff like before you quit,
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:22.720]   we assign a target quit date ahead of time,
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:24.520]   you're not just quitting on the fly,
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.720]   and that happens to be the target quit date
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.920]   in our study was the day
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.820]   where they got the first psilocybin dose,
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:31.740]   but doing things like keeping a smoking diary,
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:34.760]   like, okay, during the three weeks until you quit,
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:35.840]   every time you smoke a cigarette,
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.480]   just like jot down what you're doing,
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.960]   what you're feeling, what situation, that type of thing,
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.640]   and then having some discussion around that,
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:44.520]   and then going over the pluses and minuses in their life
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.880]   that smoking kind of comes with,
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:47.980]   and being honest about the, this is what it does for me,
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:50.200]   this is why I like it, this is why I don't like it,
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.880]   preparing for like, what if you do slip, how to handle it,
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:54.920]   like, don't dwell on guilt,
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.680]   'cause that leads to more full on relapse,
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.600]   you know, just kind of treat it as a learning experience,
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.440]   that type of thing.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:04.040]   Then you have the session day where they come in,
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.560]   they, five minutes of questionnaires,
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.200]   but pretty much they jump into the,
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.920]   we touch base with them, and we give them the capsule,
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:17.480]   it's a serious setting, but you know, a comfortable one,
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:19.520]   they're in a room that looks more like a living room
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:21.160]   than like a research lab,
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.920]   we measure their blood pressure, they didn't experience,
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.660]   but kind of minimal, kind of medical vibe to it,
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:28.920]   and they lay down on a couch,
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:32.080]   and it's a purposefully an introspective experience,
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:35.200]   so they're laying on a couch during most of the
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.120]   five to six hour experience, and they're wearing eye shades,
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:41.200]   which has a better connotation as a name than blindfold,
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.920]   like, so they're wearing eye shades, but that's,
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.400]   and they're wearing headphones
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.120]   through which music is played, mostly classical,
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.600]   although we've done some variation of that,
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.080]   I have a paper that was recently accepted,
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.560]   kind of comparing it to more like gongs,
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.920]   and harmonic bowls, and that type of thing,
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.920]   kind of like sound, you know, kind of.
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.320]   - Yeah, you've also added this to the science,
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.200]   and have a paper on the musical accompaniment
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:09.160]   to the psychedelic experience, that's fascinating.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:11.200]   - Right, and we found basically that the,
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:13.960]   about the same effect, even by a trend, not significant,
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.280]   but a little bit better of an effect,
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.000]   both in terms of subjective experience and long-term,
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.640]   whether it helped people quit smoking,
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.680]   just a little tiny non-significant trend,
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:26.000]   even favoring the novel playlist
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.940]   with the Tibetan singing bowls, and the gongs,
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.640]   and didgeridoo, and all of that,
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.360]   and so anyway, just saying, okay,
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.440]   we can deviate a little bit from this,
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.440]   like what goes back to the 1950s,
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.200]   of this method of using classical music
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.120]   as part of this psychedelic therapy,
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.320]   but they're listening to the music,
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.400]   and they're not playing DJ in real time,
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.800]   you know, it's like, you know, they're just,
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:49.600]   be the baby, you're not the decision maker for today,
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.760]   go inward, trust, let go, be open,
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:53.480]   and pretty much the only interaction,
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:55.520]   like that we're there for,
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:57.600]   is to deal with any anxiety that comes up,
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.480]   so guide is kind of a misnomer in a sense,
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.680]   it's more of a safety net,
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:05.000]   and so like, tell us if you feel some butterflies,
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.200]   that we can provide reassurance,
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:09.120]   a hold of their hand can be very powerful,
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.000]   I've had people tell me that that was like the thing
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.560]   that really just grounded them.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.600]   - Can you break apart trust, let go, be open?
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:21.440]   What, so, in a sense,
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.480]   how would you describe the experience,
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:29.280]   the intellectual and the emotional approach
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.640]   that people are supposed to take
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.240]   to really let go into the experience?
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:37.960]   - Yeah, so, trust is,
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.920]   trust the context, you know, trust the guides,
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.120]   trust the overall institutional context,
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.240]   I see it as layers of like, safety,
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.600]   even though it's everything I told you about,
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:51.080]   the relative bodily safety of psilocybin,
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.640]   nonetheless, we're still getting blood pressure
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:54.640]   throughout the session, just in case,
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:56.680]   we have a physician on hand who can respond,
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:59.200]   just in case, we're literally across the street
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.480]   from the emergency department,
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.840]   just in case, you know, all of that, you know.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.920]   - Privacy is another thing you've talked about,
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:07.080]   just trusting that you're,
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.240]   and whatever happens is just between you
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.840]   and the people in the study.
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:13.280]   - Right, and hopefully they've really gotten that,
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.760]   by that point, deep into the study,
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.080]   that like, they realize we take that seriously
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:18.280]   and everything else, you know,
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:20.160]   and so it's really kind of like a very special role
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.720]   you're playing as a researcher or a guide,
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:25.800]   and hopefully they have your trust.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.120]   And so, you know, and trust that they can be as emotional,
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:29.680]   everything from laughter to tears,
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.760]   like that's gonna be welcomed, we're not judging them.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.760]   It's like, it's a therapeutic relationship where,
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:37.520]   you know, this is a safe container, it's a safe space.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:38.360]   - Safe space. - That has a lot
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.840]   of baggage to that term, but it truly is,
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.320]   it's a safe space for that, for this type of experience,
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.300]   and to let go, so trust, let's see, let go,
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:49.880]   so that relates to the emotional,
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:52.920]   like you feel like crying, cry,
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:55.960]   you feel like laughing your ass off, laugh your ass off,
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.760]   you know, it's like, all the things,
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.880]   actually that sometimes it's more challenging
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.520]   with a, someone has a large recreational use,
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.560]   sometimes it's harder for them,
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:07.340]   because people in that context, and understandably so,
[02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:09.360]   it's more about holding your shit.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:12.480]   Someone's had a bunch of mushrooms at a party,
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:15.040]   maybe they don't wanna go into the back room
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.360]   and start crying about these thoughts
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.520]   about the relationship with their mother,
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:22.620]   and they don't wanna be the drama queen or king
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:23.840]   that bring their friends down,
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:26.340]   'cause their friends are having an experience too,
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.080]   and so they wanna compose, you know?
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.440]   - And also just the appearance in social settings
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.980]   versus the, so prioritizing how you appear to others
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:39.420]   versus the prioritizing the depth of the experience,
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:42.720]   and here in the study, you can prioritize the experience.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:44.960]   - Right, and it's all about, like you're the astronaut,
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.800]   and we're, there's only one astronaut,
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:49.680]   we're ground control, and I use this often with,
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.560]   I have a photo of the space shuttle on a plaque
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:56.700]   in my office, and I kind of often use that as an example,
[02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:58.340]   and it's like, we're here for you.
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:00.300]   Like, we're a team, but we have different roles.
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:04.140]   It's just like, you don't have to compose yourself,
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.340]   like you don't have to be concerned about our safety,
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:09.500]   like we're playing these roles today,
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:12.420]   and like, yeah, your job is to go as deep as possible,
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:16.140]   or as far out, whatever your analogy is, as possible,
[02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:19.660]   and we're keeping you safe, and so,
[02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:23.060]   yeah, and you, the emotional side is a hard one,
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:25.320]   you know, because you really want people to,
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:28.200]   like if they go into realms of, subjectively,
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:32.360]   of despair and sorrow, like, yeah, like cry,
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.600]   you know, like, it's okay, you know,
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:37.120]   and especially if someone's, you know, more macho,
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:39.640]   and you know, you want this to be the place
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:43.020]   where they can let go, and again,
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:44.520]   something that they wouldn't or shouldn't do
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.680]   if someone were to theoretically use it
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:50.980]   in a social setting, and like, and also,
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:52.520]   these other things, like even that you get
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:54.420]   in those social settings of like, yeah,
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:56.660]   you don't have to, like, worry about your wallet,
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:59.240]   or being taken advantage, or especially for a woman,
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:02.620]   sexually assaulted by some creep at a concert or something,
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:05.480]   'cause they're, you know, they're laying down,
[02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:06.480]   being far out in the section. - There's like a million
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:11.400]   sources of anxiety that are external versus internal,
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.840]   so you can just focus on your own, like,
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:14.920]   - Right. - the beautiful thing
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:16.480]   that's going on in your mind.
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:18.360]   - And even the cops at that layer,
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:21.080]   even though it's extremely unlikely,
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:22.720]   for most people, that cops would come in
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:25.280]   and bust 'em right when, like, even at that theoretical,
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:26.920]   like, that one in a billion chance,
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:29.480]   like, that might be a real thing psychologically.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:31.440]   In this context, we even got that covered.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.160]   This is, we've got DEA approval.
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:34.240]   - Yeah. - Like, you are,
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:38.080]   this is okay by every level of society that counts,
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.040]   you know, that has the authority.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.880]   So it's, so go deep, trust the, you know,
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:47.200]   trust the setting, trust yourself, you know, let go,
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.260]   and be open, so in the experience,
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.480]   and this is all subjective and by analogy,
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:54.960]   but like, if there's a door, open it, go into it.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:58.280]   If there's a stairwell, go down it,
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:00.040]   or a stairway, go up it.
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.240]   If there's a monster in the mind's eye, you know,
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:05.400]   don't run, approach it, look in the eye,
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.920]   and say, you know, let's talk.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:08.760]   - Greet it. (laughs)
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:10.920]   - Yeah, what's up, what are you doing here?
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:12.600]   Let's talk turkey, you know?
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.840]   - Dave Goggins entered the chat, okay.
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.520]   - Right, it really is that, that really is a heart of it,
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:20.280]   this radical courage, like it--
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:21.120]   - Courage.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.680]   - People are often struck by that coming out,
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.520]   like this is heavy lifting, this is hard work.
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:27.800]   People come out of this exhausted,
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.880]   and it can be extremely, some people say
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.420]   it's the most difficult thing they've done in their life,
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:36.200]   like choosing to let go on a moment,
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:39.760]   a microsecond by microsecond basis.
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:42.960]   Everything in their inclination is to say stop,
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:45.040]   sometimes, stop this, I don't like this,
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:48.200]   I didn't know it was gonna be like this, this is too much,
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:49.880]   and Terrence McKenna put it this way,
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:52.760]   it's like comparing to meditation and other techniques,
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:56.000]   it's like spending years trying to press the accelerator
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.520]   to make something happen.
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:59.680]   High-dose psychedelics is like you're speeding down
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:03.240]   the mountain in a fully loaded semi-truck,
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:06.000]   and you're charged with not slamming the brake.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:06.840]   (laughs)
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:09.880]   It's like, you know, let it happen, you know,
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:12.320]   so it's very difficult, and to engage,
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:14.880]   always, you know, go further into it,
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.280]   and take that radical courage throughout.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.600]   - What do they say in self-report,
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:24.600]   if you can put general words to it,
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:26.200]   what is their experience like?
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:27.840]   What do they say it's like?
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.440]   'Cause these are many people, like you said,
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:33.000]   that haven't probably read much about psychedelics,
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.040]   or they don't have, like with Joe Rogan,
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:39.200]   like language or stories to put on it,
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.720]   so this is very raw self-report of experiences.
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.880]   What do they say the experience is like?
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:47.560]   - Yeah, and some more so than others,
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.200]   'cause everyone has been exposed at some level or another,
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:53.160]   but some it is pretty superficial, as you're saying.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:57.000]   One of the hallmarks of psychedelics
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.120]   is just their variability, so I'm more,
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.960]   it's like not the mean, but the standard deviation,
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:03.400]   it's so wide that it's like,
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:07.160]   it could be like hellish experiences,
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:12.160]   and, you know, just absolutely beautiful
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:15.800]   and loving experiences, everything in between,
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:18.520]   and both of those, like those could be
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.360]   two minutes apart from each other,
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.080]   and sometimes kind of at the same time concurrently.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.200]   So let's see, there's different ways to,
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:31.840]   there were some Jungian psychologists back in the '60s,
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.120]   masters in Houston that wrote a really good book,
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:36.080]   The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience,
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.680]   kind of which is a play on
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:40.600]   varieties of religious experience by William James,
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.600]   that they described this, a perceptual level,
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.440]   so most people have that, you know,
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.600]   when, whether they're looking at the room
[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:51.560]   without the eyeshades on or inside their mind's eye
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:54.600]   with the eyeshades on, colors, you know,
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:58.960]   sounds like this, it's a much richer sensorium,
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:02.400]   which can be very interesting.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.040]   And then at another level,
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:08.000]   masters in Houston called it the psychodynamic level,
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.640]   and I think you could think about it more broadly than,
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:11.840]   that's kind of Jungian,
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.600]   but just the personal psychological levels,
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.000]   how I think of it, like, this is about your life,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:17.920]   there's a whole life review,
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:20.280]   oftentimes people have thoughts about their childhood,
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.280]   about their relationships, their spouse or partner,
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:27.880]   their children, their parents, their family of origin,
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:30.160]   their current family, like, you know,
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.560]   that stuff comes up a lot, including every,
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:35.800]   like the love, just people just like pouring with tears
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.880]   about like, how much, like it hits them so hard,
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:41.720]   how much they love people.
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:42.760]   Like in a way that, you know,
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:44.680]   for people that like, they'd love their family,
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.120]   but like, it just hits them so hard that like,
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:52.360]   how important this is and like the magnitude of that love
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:54.400]   and like what that means in their life.
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.160]   So those are some of the most moving experiences
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:00.360]   to be present for is where people like it hits home,
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:02.840]   like what really matters in their life.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.680]   And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.600]   called the archetypal realm,
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:12.480]   which again is sort of viewing with the focus on archetypes,
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:14.200]   which is interesting, but I think of that more generally
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.000]   as like symbolic level.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.320]   So just really deep experiences where you have,
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.440]   you do have experiences that seem symbolic of,
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.600]   you know, very much in like, you know,
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:25.680]   what we know about dreaming
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.440]   and what most people think about dreaming,
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.600]   like there's this randomness of things,
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.840]   but sometimes it's pretty clear in retrospect,
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:36.220]   oh, like this came up because this thing has been on my mind,
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:37.060]   you know, recently.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:40.280]   So it seems to be, there seems to be this symbolic level.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:41.460]   And then they have this,
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:42.960]   the last level that they describe
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:45.440]   is the mystical integral level,
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:48.340]   which this is where there's lots of terms for it,
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:52.200]   but transcendental experiences, experiences of unity,
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.160]   mystical type effects we often measure.
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:58.500]   Europeans use a scale that will refer
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.280]   to oceanic boundlessness.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:02.600]   This is all pretty much the same thing.
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:04.860]   This is like, at some sense,
[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:08.240]   the deepest level of the very sense of self
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.040]   seems to be dissolved,
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.340]   minimize or expand it such that the boundaries of the self
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:17.560]   go into, and here, I think some of this is just semantics,
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:19.820]   but whether the self is expanding
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:21.720]   such that there's no boundary between the self
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:24.040]   and the rest of the universe,
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:25.920]   or whether there's no sense of self,
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:27.200]   again, might be just semantics,
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.040]   but this radical shift or sense of loss
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.080]   of sense of self or self boundaries.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:34.900]   And that's like the most,
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:37.060]   typically, when people have that experience,
[02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:40.300]   they'll often report that as being the most remarkable thing.
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:43.400]   And this is what you don't typically get with MDMA,
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.800]   these deepest levels of the nature of reality itself,
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:48.600]   the subjectivity and objectivity,
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:53.600]   just like the seer and the seen become one,
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.260]   and it's a process.
[02:13:57.260 --> 02:13:58.460]   And yeah.
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:02.700]   - And they're able to bring that experience back
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:06.620]   and be able to describe it?
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:09.380]   - Yeah, but one of the, to a degree,
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:11.780]   but one of the hallmarks, going back to William James,
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:15.580]   of describing a mystical experience is the ineffability.
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:17.660]   And so even though it's ineffable,
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:20.380]   people try as far as they can to describe it,
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:22.500]   but when you get the real deal, they'll say,
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.480]   and even though they say a lot of helpful things
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:26.200]   to help you describe the landscape,
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:28.500]   they'll say, "No matter what I say,
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:31.400]   "I'm still not even coming anywhere close to what this was.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.020]   "Like the language is completely failing."
[02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:36.700]   And I like to joke that even though it's ineffable,
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:38.940]   and we're researchers, so we try to F it up
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:41.180]   by asking them to describe the experience.
[02:14:41.180 --> 02:14:42.020]   - F it up.
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:42.860]   I love it.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:44.140]   - Yeah. - It's a good one.
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:46.340]   But to bring it back a little bit,
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:50.380]   so for that particular study on tobacco,
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:52.720]   what was the results?
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.180]   What was the conclusions in terms of the impact
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:59.360]   of psilocybin on their addiction?
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.480]   - So in that pilot study, it was a very small
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:04.160]   and it wasn't a randomized study, so it was limited.
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.320]   The only question we could really answer was,
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:08.140]   is this worthy enough of follow-up?
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:08.980]   - Yes.
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:11.080]   - And the answer to that was abso-freaking-lutely,
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:12.520]   'cause the success rates were so high,
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:15.940]   80% biologically confirmed successful at six months.
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:19.540]   That held up to 60% biologically confirmed abstinent
[02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:22.820]   at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall.
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:26.340]   - Yeah, and so, I mean, the best that's been reported
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:28.300]   in the literature for smoking cessation
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:30.540]   is in the upper 50%, and that's with not one,
[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:32.860]   but two medications for a couple of months,
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.420]   followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:38.860]   where you're coming in once a week or once every few weeks
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:40.980]   for an entire year.
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:42.380]   And so--
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:44.580]   - But this is what-- - It's very heavy.
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:48.020]   - This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?
[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:49.980]   - So this was three doses of psilocybin
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:52.580]   over a total course including preparation, everything,
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:54.980]   a 15-week period where there's mainly,
[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:58.300]   for the most part, one meeting a week,
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:00.820]   and then the three sessions are within that.
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:03.780]   And so it's, and we scaled that back in the more,
[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:06.460]   the study we're doing right now, which I can tell you about,
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:09.160]   which is a randomized controlled trial.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:15.180]   But it's the, yeah, the original pilot study
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:20.540]   was these 15 people.
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:23.380]   So given the positive signal from the first study
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:25.020]   telling us that it was a worthy pursuit,
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:26.940]   we hustled up some money to actually be able
[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:28.580]   to afford a larger trial.
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:30.580]   So it's randomizing 80 people
[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:33.700]   to get either one psilocybin session,
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:36.960]   we've narrowed, we've scaled that down from three to one,
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:40.660]   mainly 'cause we're doing fMRI neuroimaging before and after
[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:42.380]   and it made it more experimentally complex
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:45.100]   to have multiple sessions.
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:49.620]   But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch
[02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:52.260]   using the FDA approved label,
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.900]   like standard use of the nicotine patch.
[02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:57.100]   So it's randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin,
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:00.140]   one session, 40 people get nicotine patch.
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:02.380]   And they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapy
[02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:03.900]   through the standard talk therapy.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.420]   And we've scaled it down somewhat
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:07.240]   so there's less weekly meetings,
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:09.460]   but it's within the same ballpark.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:10.940]   And right now we're still,
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:16.020]   the study's still ongoing,
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:18.480]   and in fact, we just recently started recruiting again,
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:19.580]   we paused for COVID,
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.860]   now we're starting back up with some protections
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:23.340]   like masks and whatnot.
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:28.340]   But right now for the 44 people
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:31.080]   who have gotten through the one year follow up,
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:33.580]   and so that includes 22 from each of the two groups,
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:36.200]   the success rates are extremely high.
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:37.540]   For the psilocybin group,
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:41.300]   it's 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke-free
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:43.980]   at one year after their quit date.
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:48.180]   And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch,
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:51.000]   which by the way is extremely good for the nicotine patch
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.060]   compared to previous research.
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:56.980]   So the results could change because it's ongoing,
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:58.260]   but we're mostly done
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:01.380]   and it's still looking extremely positive.
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:02.360]   So if anyone's interested,
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:04.480]   they have to be sort of be in commuting distance
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:06.580]   to the Baltimore area, but you know--
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:07.420]   - To participate.
[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:09.660]   - Right, right, to participate.
[02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:13.680]   - This is a good moment to bring up something.
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:17.900]   I think a lot of what you talked about is super interesting.
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:19.940]   And I think a lot of people listening to this,
[02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:24.940]   so now it's anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people
[02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:27.220]   for just a regular podcast.
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:29.460]   I know a lot of them will be very interested
[02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:32.820]   in what you're saying, and they're going to look you up.
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:34.580]   They're going to find your email
[02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:36.860]   and they're going to write you a long email
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:39.700]   about some of the interesting things they've found
[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:42.320]   in any of your papers.
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:45.920]   How should people contact you?
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:47.940]   What is the best way for that?
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:49.320]   Would you recommend?
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.780]   You're a super busy guy.
[02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:52.580]   You have a million things going on.
[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:56.500]   How should people communicate with you?
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:18:58.300]   - Thanks for bringing this up.
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:01.940]   I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this.
[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:05.020]   If someone's interested in participating in a study,
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:07.300]   the best thing to do is go to the website.
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:13.180]   - Of the study or of, like, yeah, which website?
[02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:15.820]   - So we have all of our psilocybin studies.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:18.840]   So everything we have is up on one website
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:21.160]   and then we link to the different study websites,
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:24.540]   but hopkinspsychedelic.org.
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:27.480]   So everything we do, or if you don't remember that,
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.000]   just go to your favorite search engine
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.120]   and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:33.640]   and you're going to find one of the first hits
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:35.960]   is going to be our, is this website.
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:38.120]   And there's going to be links to the smoking study
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.160]   and all of our other studies.
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:40.960]   If there's no link to it there,
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:42.640]   we don't have a study on it now.
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:45.000]   And if you're interested in psychedelic research
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.300]   more broadly, you can look up, you know,
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.500]   like at another university that might be closer to you.
[02:19:49.500 --> 02:19:52.260]   And there's a handful of them now across the country.
[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:55.180]   And there's some in Europe that have studies going on,
[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:56.940]   but you can, at least in the US,
[02:19:56.940 --> 02:20:00.220]   you can look at clinicaltrials.gov
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:02.220]   and look up the term psilocybin.
[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:04.460]   And in fact, optionally, people even in Europe
[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:06.220]   can register their trial on there.
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:07.660]   So that's a good way to find studies.
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:11.380]   But for our research, rather than emailing me,
[02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:13.600]   like a more efficient way is to go straight
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:17.080]   and you can do that first, the first phase of screening,
[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:18.680]   there's some questions online
[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:21.920]   and then someone will get back in touch with you.
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.800]   But I do already, you know, and I, you know,
[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:29.640]   I expect it's like going to increase,
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:32.080]   but I'm already at the level where my simple,
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:34.400]   limited mind and limited capacity is already,
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:37.680]   I sometimes fail to get back to emails.
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:40.860]   I mean, I'm trying to respond to my colleagues, my mentees.
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.540]   All these things, my responsibilities,
[02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:46.140]   and as many of the people just inquiring about,
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:48.340]   I wanna go to graduate school, I'm interested in this,
[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:51.060]   I had this, I have a daughter that took a psychedelic
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:53.260]   and she's having trouble, and it's like,
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:54.760]   I try to respond to those,
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:58.060]   but sometimes I just simply can't get to all of them already.
[02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:00.700]   - To be honest, like from my perspective,
[02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:03.500]   it's been quite heartbreaking
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:07.420]   'cause I basically don't respond to any emails anymore.
[02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:11.940]   And especially as you mentioned mentees and so on,
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:15.100]   like outside of that circle, it's heartbreaking to me
[02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:18.680]   how many brilliant people that are thoughtful people,
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:21.540]   like loving people, and they write long emails
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:26.320]   that are really, by the way, I do read them very often.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:29.060]   It's just that I don't, the response
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:31.740]   is then you're starting a conversation.
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:34.700]   And there's, the heartbreaking aspect is
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:37.260]   you only have so many hours in the day
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:39.060]   to have deep, meaningful conversations
[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:40.860]   with human beings on this earth.
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:42.540]   And so you have to select who they are,
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:43.700]   and usually it's your family,
[02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:46.300]   it's people like you're directly working with.
[02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:48.660]   And even, I guarantee you with this conversation,
[02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:53.660]   people will write you long, really thoughtful emails,
[02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:55.840]   like there'll be brilliant people,
[02:21:55.840 --> 02:21:59.300]   faculty from all over, PhD students from all over.
[02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:00.300]   And it's heartbreaking
[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:01.660]   because you can't really get back to them.
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:05.380]   But you're saying like many of them, if you do respond,
[02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:07.620]   it's more like, here, go to this website.
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.540]   If you're, when you're interested into the study,
[02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:13.180]   it's just, it makes sense to directly go to the site
[02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:16.420]   if there's applications open, just apply for the study.
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:17.660]   - Right, right, right.
[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:19.780]   You know, as either a volunteer
[02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:22.580]   or if we're looking for somebody,
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:25.220]   you know, we're gonna be posting,
[02:22:25.220 --> 02:22:28.260]   including on the Hopkins University website,
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:30.940]   we're gonna be posting if we're looking for a position.
[02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:32.580]   I am right now actually looking through,
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:35.420]   and it's mainly been through email and contacts,
[02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:37.540]   but should I say it?
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:39.140]   Because I think I'd rather cast my nets wide,
[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:40.860]   but I'm looking for a postdoc right now.
[02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:41.700]   - Oh, great.
[02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:44.740]   - So I've mentored postdocs for, I don't know,
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:46.340]   like a dozen years or so,
[02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:50.060]   and more and more of their time is being spent on psychedelics
[02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:52.220]   so someone's free to contact me.
[02:22:52.220 --> 02:22:54.880]   That's more of a, that's sort of so close to home,
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:57.900]   that's a personal, you know, that like emailing me
[02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:01.920]   about that, but I come to appreciate more the advice
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:03.860]   that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like,
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:07.100]   I think it's him, like five cents emails, you know,
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:10.980]   like, you know, a subject that gets to the point
[02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:11.940]   that tells you what it's about
[02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:14.380]   so that like you break through the signal to the noise.
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:15.660]   But I really appreciate what you're saying
[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:17.660]   because part of the equation for me is like,
[02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:21.160]   I have a three-year-old and like my time on the ground,
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:23.820]   on the floor, playing blocks or cars with him
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.860]   is part of that equation.
[02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:27.500]   And even if the day is ending
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:29.220]   and I know some of those emails are slipping by
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:30.380]   and I'll never get back to them,
[02:23:30.380 --> 02:23:32.900]   and I'm struggling with it already,
[02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:34.180]   and I get what you're saying,
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:35.860]   is I haven't seen anything yet
[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:39.020]   if with the type of exposure that like your podcast gets.
[02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:40.380]   - This will bring an exposure,
[02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:42.380]   and then I think in terms of post-docs,
[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.340]   this is a really good podcast in the sense
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:47.860]   that there's a lot of brilliant PhD students out there
[02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:49.420]   that are looking for posts from all over,
[02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:52.220]   from MIT, probably from Hopkins,
[02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:53.660]   this is just all over the place.
[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:57.380]   So this is, and I, we have different preferences,
[02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:00.420]   but my preference would also be to have like a form
[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:01.940]   that they could fill out for posts
[02:24:01.940 --> 02:24:05.260]   because it's very difficult through email
[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:09.020]   to tell who's a really going to be a strong collaborator
[02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:12.280]   for you, like a strong post-doc, strong student,
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:15.620]   because you want a bunch of details,
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:16.480]   but at the same time,
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:19.540]   you don't want a million pages worth of email.
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:21.580]   So you want a little bit of application process.
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:23.300]   So I usually set up a form
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:27.440]   that helps me indicate how passionate the person is,
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:32.440]   how willing they are to do hard work.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:35.420]   Like I often ask a question,
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:39.060]   people, of what do you think is more important
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:41.580]   to work hard or to work smart?
[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:45.340]   And I use that, those types of questions
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:47.460]   to indicate who I would like to work with,
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:51.540]   because it's counterintuitive.
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:56.220]   But anyway, I'll leave that question unanswered
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.820]   for people to figure out themselves.
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:59.980]   But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins,
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:01.660]   you will understand.
[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:02.500]   So anyway.
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:04.340]   - Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything.
[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:05.660]   - It's difficult.
[02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:07.420]   And that's something that evolves.
[02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:09.900]   Email is such a messy thing.
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:14.020]   There's, speaking of Baltimore,
[02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:16.880]   Cal Newport, if you know who that is,
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:19.940]   he wrote a book called "Deep Work."
[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:21.340]   He's a computer science professor
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:23.540]   and he's currently working on a book about email,
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:25.780]   about all the ways that email's broken.
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:28.700]   So this is gonna be a fascinating read.
[02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:30.620]   This is a little bit of a general question,
[02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:35.620]   but almost a bigger picture question
[02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:38.180]   that we touched on a little bit,
[02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:40.620]   but let's just touch it in a full way,
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:43.420]   which is what have all the psychedelic studies
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:48.260]   you've conducted taught you about the human mind,
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:52.340]   about the human brain and the human mind?
[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:55.180]   Is there something, if you look at the human scientists
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:59.680]   you were before this work and the scientists you are now,
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:03.680]   how has your understanding of the human mind changed?
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:08.500]   - I'm thinking of that in two categories.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:13.340]   One kind of more scientific.
[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:14.580]   I mean, they're both scientific,
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:19.580]   but one more about the brain and behavior
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:22.820]   in the mind, so to speak.
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:25.180]   And as a behaviorist, I always see sort of the mind
[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:28.020]   as a metaphor for behavior.
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.240]   But anyway, that gets philosophical.
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.260]   It's really increasing the,
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:39.580]   so the one category is increasing the appreciation
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:43.180]   for the magnitude of depth.
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:47.440]   I mean, so these are all metaphors of human experience.
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:48.980]   That might be a good way to,
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:51.020]   'cause you use certain words like consciousness
[02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:53.660]   and whatnot, and it's like we're using constructs
[02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:56.940]   that aren't well-defined unless we kind of dig in,
[02:26:56.940 --> 02:26:59.740]   but into human experience,
[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:03.860]   like that the experiences on these compounds
[02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:07.200]   can be so far out there or so deep.
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:10.900]   And that, like, and they're doing that by tinkering
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:13.220]   with the same machinery that's going on up there.
[02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:17.420]   I mean, my assumption, and I think it's a good assumption,
[02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:20.220]   is that all experiences,
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:25.220]   there's a biological side to all phenomenal experience.
[02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:29.180]   So there is not, the divide between biology
[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:35.980]   and experience or psychology is,
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:38.420]   it's not one or the other.
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:43.060]   These are just two sides of the same coin.
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.780]   - I mean, you're avoiding the use
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:47.580]   of the word consciousness, for example,
[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:50.900]   but the experience is referring to the subjective experience.
[02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:54.460]   So it's the actual technical use of the word consciousness
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.780]   of, yeah, subjective experience.
[02:27:57.780 --> 02:27:59.860]   - And even that word, there's certain ways that,
[02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:02.500]   like sort of like if we're talking about access consciousness
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:05.820]   or narrative self-awareness, which is an aspect of,
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:08.300]   like you can wrap a definition around that
[02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:09.760]   and we can talk meaningfully about it,
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:11.180]   but so often around psychedelics,
[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:12.740]   it's used in this much more,
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:15.420]   in terms of ultimately explaining
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:17.180]   phenomenal consciousness itself,
[02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:18.880]   the so-called hard problem,
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:22.380]   relating to that question.
[02:28:22.380 --> 02:28:25.780]   And psychedelics really haven't spoken to that.
[02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:27.020]   And that's why it's hard,
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:29.040]   because like it's hard to imagine anything.
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.580]   But I think what I was getting is that
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:34.020]   psychedelics have done this by,
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:37.020]   the reason I was getting into the biology versus mind,
[02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:39.220]   psychology divide, is that,
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:42.300]   that just to kind of set up the fact that
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:45.780]   I think all of our experience is related
[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:49.240]   to these biological events.
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:52.860]   So whether they be naturally occurring neurotransmitters,
[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:56.420]   like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine, et cetera,
[02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:59.200]   and a whole other sort of biological activity
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.580]   and kind of another layer up
[02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:03.600]   that we could talk about as network activity,
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:05.160]   communication amongst brain areas,
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:06.740]   like this is always going on,
[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:10.580]   even if I just prompt you to think about a loved one,
[02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:13.420]   like there's something happening biologically.
[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:15.940]   Okay, so that's always another side of the coin.
[02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:18.660]   So, and another way to put that
[02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:21.780]   is all of our subjective experience, outside of drugs,
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:26.780]   it's all a controlled hallucination in a sense.
[02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:28.900]   Like this is completely constructed.
[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:33.740]   Our experience of reality is completely a simulation.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:36.340]   So I think we're on solid ground to say
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:37.380]   that that's our best guess
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:40.980]   and that's a pretty reasonable thing to say scientifically.
[02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:43.020]   - Take all the rich complexity of the world
[02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:45.980]   emerges from just some biology and some chemicals.
[02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:48.780]   - So in that definition implied a causation,
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.820]   it comes from, and so that's,
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:53.900]   we know at least there's a solid correlation there.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.260]   And so then we delve deep into the philosophy
[02:29:57.260 --> 02:30:00.420]   of like idealism or materialism and things like this,
[02:30:00.420 --> 02:30:01.500]   which I'm not an expert in,
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.940]   but I know we're getting into that territory.
[02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:06.980]   You don't even necessarily have to go there.
[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:09.300]   Like you at least go to the level of like,
[02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.180]   okay, we know there's,
[02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:12.340]   there seems to be this one-on-one correspondence
[02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:14.820]   and that seems pretty solid.
[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:16.660]   Like you can't prove a negative and you can't prove,
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:18.980]   you know, it's in that category of like,
[02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:20.540]   you could come up with an experience
[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:22.620]   that maybe doesn't have a biological correlate,
[02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:24.540]   but then you're talking about,
[02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:25.860]   there's also the limits of the science.
[02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:26.860]   Is it a false negative?
[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:29.620]   But I think our best guess and a very decent assumption
[02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.940]   is that every psychological event
[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:33.740]   has a biological correlate.
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:36.140]   So with that said, you know,
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:39.340]   the idea that you can throw, alter that biology
[02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:42.220]   in a pretty trivial manner.
[02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:45.380]   I mean, you could take like a relatively small number
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:48.900]   of these molecules, throw them into the nervous system
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:53.080]   and then have a 60 year old person who has,
[02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:59.260]   you name it, I mean, that has hiked to the top of Everest
[02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:02.700]   and that speaks five languages and that has been married
[02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:06.700]   and has kids and grandkids and has, you name it,
[02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:09.060]   you know, like been at the top and say,
[02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:12.820]   this fundamentally changed who I am as a person
[02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:16.060]   and what I think life is about.
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:20.940]   Like that's the thing about psychedelics
[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.620]   that just floors me and it never fails.
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:28.020]   I mean, sometimes you get bogged down by the paperwork
[02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:30.180]   and running studies and all the, I don't know,
[02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:33.300]   all of the BS that can come with being in academia
[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:34.700]   and everything and then you,
[02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:37.300]   and sometimes you get some dud sessions
[02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:39.940]   where it's not the full, all the magic isn't happening
[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:41.380]   and it's, you know, more or less it's,
[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:43.740]   or it's either a dud or somewhere in the,
[02:31:43.740 --> 02:31:45.260]   and I don't mean to dismiss them, but you know,
[02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:47.700]   it's not like these magnificent sort of reports,
[02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:50.700]   but sometimes you get the full Monty report
[02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:52.660]   from one of these people and you're like,
[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:54.460]   oh yeah, that's why we're doing this.
[02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:56.520]   Whether it's like therapeutically
[02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:59.920]   or just to understand the mind.
[02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:03.720]   And you're like, you're still floored.
[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:05.760]   Like how is that possible?
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:10.760]   How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:13.620]   and say, and this person is now saying
[02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:16.240]   that they're making fundamental differences
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:19.800]   in the priorities of their life after 60 years.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:23.640]   - It also just fills you with awe
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:27.000]   of the possibility of experiences
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.520]   we're yet to have uncovered.
[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:32.200]   If just a few chemicals can change so much,
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:36.520]   it's like, man, what if this could be up?
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:40.680]   I mean, like, 'cause we're just like took a little,
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:43.200]   it's like lighting a match or something in the darkness
[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:44.920]   and you could see there's a lot more there,
[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:47.600]   but you don't know how much more.
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:49.080]   And that's- - Right.
[02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.960]   And then like, where's that gonna go with like,
[02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:53.600]   I mean, I'm always like aware of the fact
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:55.760]   that like we always as humans and as scientists
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:58.000]   think that we figured out 99%
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.360]   and we're working on that first 1%
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:01.460]   and we got to keep reminding ourselves it's hard to do.
[02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:03.800]   Like we figured out like not even 1%,
[02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:05.760]   like we know nothing.
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:09.600]   And so like, I can speculate and I might sound like a fool,
[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:12.040]   but like what are drugs, even the concept of drugs,
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:14.800]   like 10 years, 50 years, 100 years,
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:17.220]   a thousand years if we're surviving.
[02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:22.880]   Like, you know, molecules that go to a specific area
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:25.120]   of the brain in combination with technology,
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:27.720]   in combination with the magnetic stimulation,
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:29.960]   in combination with the, you know,
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:31.800]   like targeted pharmacology of like,
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:35.120]   oh, like this subset of serotonin 2A receptors
[02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:37.800]   in the clostrum, you know, at this time
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:39.400]   in this particular sequence,
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:41.280]   in combination with this other thing,
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:44.880]   like this baseball cap you wear that like has, you know,
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:47.720]   has one of the, is doing some of these things
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:49.120]   that we can only do with these like giant,
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:50.440]   like pieces of equipment now,
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:53.240]   like where it's gonna go is gonna be endless.
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:55.400]   And it becomes easy to, you know,
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:56.840]   combined within virtual reality
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:33:58.160]   where the virtual reality is gonna move
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:01.520]   from being something out here to being more in there.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:04.100]   And then we're getting, like we talked about before,
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:06.640]   we're already in a virtual reality
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:11.080]   in terms of human perception and cognition models
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:14.080]   of the universe being all representations
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:16.680]   and, you know, sort of, you know, color not existing
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:20.240]   and just, you know, representations of EM,
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:22.000]   wavelengths, et cetera, you know,
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:23.840]   sound being vibrations and all of this.
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:28.320]   And so as the external VR and the internal VR
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.240]   come closer to each other,
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:31.280]   like this is what I think about
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:32.960]   in terms of the future of drugs,
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:35.600]   like all of this stuff sort of combines.
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.600]   And like where that goes is just, it's unthinkable.
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.400]   Like we're probably gonna, you know,
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:45.680]   again, I might sound like a fool
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:48.960]   and this may not happen, but I think it's possible,
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:50.760]   you know, to go completely offline,
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:53.320]   like where most of people's experiences
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:58.320]   may be going into these internal worlds.
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:02.400]   And I mean, maybe you through some,
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:03.800]   through a combination of these techniques,
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:05.400]   you create experiences where someone could live
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:08.080]   a thousand years in terms of,
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:09.640]   maybe they're living a regular lifespan,
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.140]   but in over the next two seconds,
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:13.320]   you're living a thousand years worth of experience.
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:15.040]   - Inside your mind.
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:16.600]   - Yeah, through this manipulation of the,
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:19.440]   like, is that possible?
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:22.960]   Like just based on like first principles.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.880]   - Yeah, first principles, yes.
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:26.080]   - I think so.
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:30.280]   Like give us another 50, 100, 500, like who knows,
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:33.200]   but like how could it not go there?
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:36.960]   - And a small tangent, what are your thoughts
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:39.400]   in this broader definition of drugs,
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:42.200]   of psychedelics, of mind altering things?
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:44.280]   What are your thoughts about Neuralink
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:47.080]   and brain computer interfaces,
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:52.080]   sort of being able to electrically stimulate
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:57.660]   and read neuronal activity in the brain,
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.840]   and then connect that to the computer,
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:04.840]   which is another way from a computational perspective
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:06.640]   for me is kind of appealing,
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:11.640]   but it's another way of altering subtly
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.280]   the behavior of the brain that's kind of,
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:18.080]   if you zoom out, reminiscent of the way
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:20.360]   psychedelics do as well.
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:23.280]   So what do you have, like what are your thoughts
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:26.200]   about Neuralink, what are your hopes
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:30.400]   as a researcher of mind altering devices,
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:32.440]   systems, chemicals?
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:36.120]   - I guess broadly speaking, I'm all for it.
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:38.400]   I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics,
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:40.480]   but it comes with all the caveats.
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:42.760]   You're going into a brave new world
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:44.400]   where it's like all of a sudden,
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:46.160]   there's gonna be a dark side,
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:51.080]   there's gonna be serious ethical considerations,
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:54.760]   but that should not stop us from moving there.
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:57.280]   I mean, particularly the stuff from an unknown expert,
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.720]   but on the short list, in the short term,
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:01.400]   it's like, yeah, can we help these serious
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:02.560]   neurological disorders?
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:03.520]   Like, hell yeah.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:06.600]   And I'm also sensitive to something,
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:10.320]   being someone that has lots of neuroscience
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:14.360]   colleagues with some of this stuff,
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:16.800]   and I can't talk about particulars, I'm not recalling,
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.720]   but in terms of stuff getting out there
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:22.440]   and then kind of a mocking of,
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:27.160]   oh gosh, they're saying this is unique,
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:29.840]   we know this, or sort of like this belittling of like,
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:33.080]   oh, this sounds like it's just a, I don't know,
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:36.000]   a commercialization or like an oversimplified,
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.680]   I forget what the example was, but something like,
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:40.320]   something that came off to some of my
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:42.880]   neuroscientific colleagues as an oversimplification
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:44.640]   or at least the way they said it.
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:46.400]   - Oh, from a New York perspective?
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:49.280]   - Right, oh, we've known that for years,
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:52.080]   but I'm very sympathetic to like,
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:54.120]   maybe it's because of my very limited,
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:57.960]   but relatively speaking, the amount of exposure
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:00.520]   the psychedelic work has had to my limited experience
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:02.880]   of being out there, and then you think about someone
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.520]   like Mike Musk, who's like really, really out there,
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:10.160]   and you just get all these arrows that like,
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:13.080]   and it's hard to be like when you're plowing new ground,
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:16.440]   like you're gonna get, you're gonna get criticized,
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:18.040]   like every little word that you,
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:20.160]   this balance between speaking to like people
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:21.520]   to make it meaningful, something scientists
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:23.880]   aren't very good at, having people understand
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:25.960]   what you're saying, and then being belittled
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.120]   by oversimplifying something in terms of the public message.
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:33.160]   So I'm extremely sympathetic, and I'm a big fan
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:35.560]   of like what that, you know, what Elon Musk does,
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:39.040]   like tunnels through the ground, and SpaceX,
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:40.560]   and all this, it's like hell yeah,
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:43.840]   like this guy has some great ideas.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:45.160]   - And there's something to be said,
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:47.400]   it's not just the communication to the public.
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:50.240]   I think his first principles thinking,
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:51.520]   it's like, 'cause I get this
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:53.000]   in the artificial intelligence world,
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.240]   it's probably similar to neuroscience world,
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:57.360]   where Elon will say something like,
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:00.840]   or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles,
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:05.160]   and he's sort of, I could sense how much he pisses off
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.920]   like every roboticist at MIT, and everybody who works
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.920]   on like the human factor side of safety,
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:14.680]   of autonomous vehicles, in saying like,
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:18.000]   "Nah, we don't need to consider human beings in the car,
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.280]   "like a car will drive itself, it's obvious
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:22.800]   "that neural networks is all you need,
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:26.260]   "like it's obvious that we should be able to,
[02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:30.240]   "systems that should be able to learn constantly."
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:32.080]   And they don't really need LIDAR,
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:36.480]   they just need cameras, because we humans just use our eyes,
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:39.320]   and that's the same as cameras, so like it doesn't,
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:41.040]   why would we need anything else?
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.880]   You just have to make a system that learns faster
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:46.440]   and faster and faster, and neural networks can do that,
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:48.880]   and so that's pissing off every single community,
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:50.600]   it's pissing off human factors community,
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:53.280]   saying you don't need to consider the human driver
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.080]   in the picture, you can just focus on the robotics problem,
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:59.440]   it's pissing off every robotics person
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:01.720]   for saying LIDAR can be just ignored,
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:04.320]   it can be camera, every robotics person knows
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:06.320]   that camera is really noisy,
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:08.200]   that it's really difficult to deal with,
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:13.200]   but he's, and then every AI person who says,
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:16.560]   who hears neural networks and says like,
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:18.560]   "Neural networks can learn everything,"
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.520]   like almost presuming that it's kind of going
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:22.200]   to achieve general intelligence.
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.880]   The problem with all those haters in the three communities
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.080]   is that they're looking one year ahead, five years ahead,
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:35.080]   the hilarious thing about the quote unquote ridiculous
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:37.440]   things that Elon Musk is saying is they have
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:40.520]   a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years,
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:43.020]   and so like, when you just look at the, you know,
[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:45.680]   when you look at the progression
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:47.300]   of these kinds of predictions,
[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:51.200]   and sometimes first principles thinking can allow you
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:55.120]   to do that is you see that it's kind of obvious
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:58.160]   that things are going to progress this way,
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.000]   and if you just remove the prejudice you hold
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:04.600]   about the particular battles
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:06.560]   of the current academic environment,
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:09.600]   and just look at the big picture of the progression
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:14.480]   of the technology, you can usually see the world
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:17.080]   in the same kind of way, and so in that same way,
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:20.040]   looking at psychedelics, you can see like,
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:22.800]   there is so many exciting possibilities here
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:25.040]   if we fully engage in the research.
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:28.640]   Same thing with Neuralink, if we fully engage,
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:31.440]   so we go from 1,000 channels of communication
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:33.840]   to the brain to billions of channels
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:35.680]   of communication to the brain,
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:38.560]   and we figure out many of the details
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:42.120]   of how to do that safely with neurosurgery and so on,
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:45.200]   that the world would just change completely
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.480]   in the same kind of way that Elon is,
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:49.240]   it's so ridiculous to hear him talk
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:52.440]   about symbiotic relationship between AI
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:57.440]   and the human brain, but it's like, is it though?
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:00.640]   (Lex laughing)
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:01.480]   Is it?
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:03.600]   Because I can see in 50 years,
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.600]   there's going to be an obvious,
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:08.320]   like everyone will have, like obviously you have,
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:11.120]   like why are we typing stuff in the computer?
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:13.160]   It doesn't make any sense, that's stupid.
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:16.280]   People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse?
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:17.120]   What is that?
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:19.240]   - And it seems pretty clear, like we're gonna be there.
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:20.080]   - Yeah.
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:21.680]   - Like, and the only question is like, what's the timeframe?
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:23.960]   Is that gonna be 20 or is it 50 or 100?
[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:25.280]   Like, how could we not?
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:27.400]   - And the thing that I guess upsets
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:31.720]   with Elon and others is the timeline he tends to do.
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:33.800]   I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing.
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:37.560]   I definitely do it, which is like, it'll be done this year,
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:39.640]   versus like it'll be done in 10 years.
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:41.520]   The timeline is a little bit too rushed,
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:43.160]   but from our leadership perspective,
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:47.320]   it inspires the engineers to do the best work of their life,
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:49.880]   to really kind of believe,
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:52.920]   because to do the impossible, you have to first believe it,
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:56.000]   which is a really important aspect of innovation.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:57.840]   - And there's the delay discounting aspect
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:42:58.840]   I talked about before.
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:00.480]   It's like saying, oh, this is gonna be a thing
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:01.800]   20, 50 years from now.
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:04.240]   It's like, what motivates anybody?
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:05.380]   And even if you're fudging it,
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:07.080]   or you're like wishful thinking a little bit,
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:09.760]   or let's just say erring on one side
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:12.360]   of the probability distribution,
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:14.440]   like there's value in saying like, yeah,
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.240]   like there's a chance we could get this done in a year.
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:18.080]   And you know what?
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:21.120]   And if you set a goal for a year and you're not successful,
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:23.200]   hey, you might get it done in three years.
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:25.560]   Whereas if you had aimed at 20 years,
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:27.080]   well, you either would have never done it at all,
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:28.320]   or you would have aimed at 20 years
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:30.020]   and then would have taken you 10.
[02:43:30.020 --> 02:43:32.800]   So the other thing I think about this,
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:34.400]   like in terms of his work,
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:36.680]   and I guess we've seen with psychedelics,
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:39.280]   it's like there's a lack of appreciation
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:40.760]   for like sort of the variability
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:42.560]   you need in natural selection,
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:45.000]   sort of extrapolating from biological,
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.440]   you know, from evolution, like,
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:51.040]   hey, maybe he's wrong about focusing only on the cameras
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:52.520]   and not these other things.
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:53.780]   Be empirically driven.
[02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:54.840]   It's like, yeah, you need to,
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:56.600]   like when he's, you know,
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:57.800]   when you need to get the regulation,
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:43:59.080]   is it safe enough to get this thing on the road?
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:43:59.920]   Those are real questions.
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:01.280]   And be empirically driven.
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:04.800]   And if he can meet the whatever standard is relevant,
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:06.560]   that's the standard and be driven by that.
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:07.940]   So don't let it affect your ethics.
[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:11.440]   But if he's on the wrong path, how wonderful.
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:12.720]   Someone's exploring that wrong path.
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:14.000]   He's gonna figure out it's a wrong path.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.840]   And like other people, he's,
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:17.760]   damn it, he's doing something.
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:19.920]   Like he's, you know, and,
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:23.880]   and so appreciating that variability,
[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:26.080]   you know, that like, it's valuable,
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:27.280]   even if he's not on,
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:29.760]   I mean, this is all over the place in science.
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:30.960]   It's like a good theory.
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:33.160]   One standard definition is that
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:35.400]   it generates testable hypotheses.
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:37.640]   And like the ultimate model
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:39.200]   is never gonna be the same as reality.
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:40.720]   Some models are gonna work better than others.
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:45.720]   Like, you know, Newtonian physics got us a long ways,
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:49.600]   even if there was a better model, like waiting.
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.280]   And some models weren't as good as, you know,
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:53.480]   were never that successful,
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:56.440]   but just even like putting them out there and testing.
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:58.640]   We wouldn't know something is a bad model
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:00.400]   until someone puts it out anyway, so.
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.300]   - Yeah, diversity of ideas is essential for progress, yeah.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:07.760]   So we brought up consciousness a few times.
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:11.240]   There's several things I wanna kinda disentangle there.
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:13.240]   So one, you've recently wrote a paper titled
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:16.020]   Consciousness, Religion, and Gurus,
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:18.100]   Pitfalls of Psychedelic Medicine.
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:20.480]   So that's one side of it.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:21.920]   You've kind of already mentioned that
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:24.520]   these terms can be a little bit misused
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:28.920]   or used in a variety of ways
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:32.440]   that can be confusing.
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:34.540]   But in a specific way,
[02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:39.100]   as much as we can be specific about these things,
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:41.600]   about the actual heart problem of consciousness
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:44.280]   or understanding what is consciousness,
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:46.760]   this weird thing that it feels like,
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:49.600]   it feels like something to experience things,
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:55.720]   have psychedelics given you some kind of insight
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:58.240]   on what is consciousness?
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:01.080]   You've mentioned that it feels like psychedelics
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.840]   allows you to kind of dismantle your sense of self,
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:09.160]   like step outside of yourself.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:13.560]   So that feels like somehow playing
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:15.880]   with this mechanism of consciousness.
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:18.040]   And if it is in fact playing with
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:21.440]   the mechanism of consciousness using just a few chemicals,
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:24.160]   it feels like we're very much in the neighborhood
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:27.760]   of being able to maybe understand
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:30.000]   the actual biological mechanisms
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.720]   of how consciousness can emerge from the brain.
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:34.880]   - So yeah, there's a bunch there.
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:39.280]   I think my preface is that I certainly have opinions
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:42.720]   that I can say, here are my best speculations
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:47.480]   as just a person and an armchair philosopher,
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:50.320]   and it's that philosophy is certainly not my training
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:52.280]   and my expertise.
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:53.480]   So I have thoughts there,
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:55.520]   but that I recognize are completely
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:57.340]   in the realm of speculation,
[02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:59.460]   that are like things that I would love
[02:46:59.460 --> 02:47:01.560]   to wrap empirical science around,
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:06.360]   but that are, you know, there's no data
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:08.320]   and getting to the heart problem,
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:11.760]   like no conceivable way, even though I'm very open,
[02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:14.620]   like I'm hoping that that problem can be cracked.
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:16.960]   And I do, as an armchair philosopher,
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:18.040]   I do think that is a problem.
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:20.640]   I don't think it can be dismissed as some people argue,
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:22.960]   it's not even really a problem.
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:25.440]   It strikes me that explaining just the existence
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:27.480]   of phenomenal consciousness is a problem.
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:30.480]   So anyway, I very much keep that divide in mind
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:31.800]   when I talk about these things,
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:34.160]   what we can really say about what we've learned
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:35.600]   through science, including by psychedelics,
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:38.520]   versus like what I can speculate on
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:42.760]   in terms of the nature of reality and consciousness.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:47.760]   But in terms of, by and large, skeptically,
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.240]   I have to say, psychedelics have not really taught us
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:55.720]   anything about the nature of consciousness.
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:57.000]   I'm hopeful that they will.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.060]   They have been used around certain,
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:03.000]   I don't even know if features is the right term,
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:04.840]   but things that are called consciousness.
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:06.800]   So consciousness can refer to not only
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:08.280]   just phenomenal consciousness,
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:11.920]   which is like, you know, the source of the heart problem
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:16.120]   and what it is to be like Nagel's description,
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.400]   but the sense of self, which can be sort of like
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:22.840]   the experiential self moment to moment,
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:24.480]   or it can be like the narrative self,
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:25.960]   the stringing together of stories.
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:29.160]   So those are things that I think can be,
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:33.920]   and a little bit's been done with psychedelics
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:37.460]   regarding that, but I think there's far more potential.
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:43.680]   - So like one story that unfolded is that
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.960]   psychedelics acutely have an effects
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:48.320]   on the default mode network,
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.640]   a certain pattern of activation
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:52.180]   amongst a subset of brain areas
[02:48:52.180 --> 02:48:55.880]   that is associated with self-referential processing.
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.240]   It seems to be more active,
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:01.240]   more communication between these areas,
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:04.000]   like the posterior cingulate cortex
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000]   and the medial prefrontal cortex, for example,
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.560]   being parts of this that are,
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:10.960]   and others that are tied with sort of
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:13.540]   thinking about yourself, remembering yourself in the past,
[02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:15.640]   projecting yourself into the future.
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:18.600]   And so an interesting story emerged
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:23.600]   when it was found that when psilocybin is on board,
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:25.600]   you know, in the person's system,
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:29.320]   that there's less communication amongst these areas.
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:32.160]   So with resting state fMRI imaging,
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:35.220]   that there's less synchronization
[02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:38.200]   or presumably communication between these areas.
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:41.600]   And so I think it has been overstated
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:43.120]   in terms of, ah, we see this is like,
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:45.240]   this is the dissolving of the ego.
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:48.200]   The story made a whole lot of sense,
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:50.960]   but there's several,
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:53.460]   I think that story is really being challenged.
[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:55.840]   Like one, we see increasing number of drugs
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:59.560]   that decouple that network,
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.680]   including ones like that aren't psychedelic.
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:05.000]   So this may just be a property, frankly,
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.800]   of being like, you know, screwed up, you know?
[02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:09.240]   Like, you know, being out of your head,
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:10.600]   being like, you know.
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:12.440]   - Anytime you mess with the perception system,
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:15.600]   maybe it screws up some,
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:17.720]   just our ability to just function
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:20.960]   in the holistically like we do in order,
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:22.600]   yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff,
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:24.120]   to be able to map it to memory,
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:25.840]   to connect things together,
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:28.160]   the whole recur mechanism,
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:30.400]   that could just be messed with.
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.200]   - Right, and it could, and I'm speculating,
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:33.120]   it could be tied to more,
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:35.360]   if you had to download a new language, everyday language,
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:37.560]   like not feeling like yourself.
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.160]   So whether that be like really drunk
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:41.040]   or really hopped up on amphetamine,
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:43.720]   or, you know, like we found it,
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:45.480]   like decoupling of the default mode network
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:49.000]   on salvinorin A, which is a smokable psychedelic,
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000]   which is a non-classic psychedelic,
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.800]   but another one where, like DMT,
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:55.000]   where people are often talking to entities
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:55.840]   and that type of thing.
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:57.320]   That was a really fun study to run.
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:50:58.680]   But nonetheless, most people say
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:00.320]   it's not a classic psychedelic
[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:04.440]   and doesn't have some of those phenomenal features
[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:06.880]   that people report from classic psychedelics
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:11.160]   and not sort of the clear sort of ego loss type,
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:12.920]   at least not in the way that people report it
[02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:13.960]   with classic psychedelics.
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:15.520]   So you get it with all these different drugs.
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:19.160]   And then you also see just broad changes
[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:21.440]   in network activity with other networks.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:25.840]   And so I think that story took off a little too soon,
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:27.320]   although, so I think,
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:30.720]   and the story that the DMN, the default mode network,
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:32.380]   relating to the self,
[02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:34.000]   and I know some neuroscientists,
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.960]   it drives them crazy if you say that it's the ego,
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:42.120]   but self-referential processing, if you go that far,
[02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:45.160]   like that was already known before psychedelics.
[02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:48.920]   Psychedelics didn't really contribute to that,
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:52.640]   the idea that this type of brain network activity
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:54.560]   was related to a sense of self.
[02:51:56.200 --> 02:52:00.160]   But it is absolutely striking that psychedelics
[02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:02.400]   that people report with pretty high reliability,
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:06.280]   these unity experiences that where people subjectively,
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:10.160]   like they report losing or getting like the boundaries
[02:52:10.160 --> 02:52:11.360]   of the, however you wanna say it,
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:15.000]   like these unity experiences,
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:16.560]   I think we can do a lot with that
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:19.480]   in terms of figuring out the nature of the sense of self.
[02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:23.440]   Now, I don't think that's the same as the hard problem
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:25.800]   or the existence of phenomenal consciousness
[02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:27.560]   'cause you can build an AI system,
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:28.760]   and you correct me if I'm wrong,
[02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:31.640]   that will pass a Turing test
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:34.840]   in terms of demonstrating the qualities
[02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:37.280]   of a sense of self.
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:38.840]   It will talk as if there's a self,
[02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:43.840]   and there's probably a certain algorithm or whatever,
[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:47.880]   computational, scaling up of computations that results
[02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:52.160]   in somehow, and I think this is the argument with humans,
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:54.000]   but some have speculated this,
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.840]   why do we have this illusion of the self that's evolved?
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:01.560]   And we might find this with AI that it works,
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:03.360]   having a sense of self,
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:06.120]   and that's stated incorrectly,
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:12.200]   acting as if there is an agent at play
[02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:17.000]   and behaviorally acting like there is a self,
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.440]   that might kind of work.
[02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:22.440]   And so you can program a computer or a robot
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:27.360]   to basically demonstrate, have an algorithm like that
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:28.920]   and demonstrate that type of behavior,
[02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:30.960]   and I think that's completely silent
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:33.840]   on whether there's an actual experience inside there.
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:36.760]   - I've been struggling to find the right words
[02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:38.520]   and how I feel about that whole thing,
[02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:42.360]   but 'cause I've said it poorly before,
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:44.360]   I've before said that there's no difference
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:48.840]   between the appearance and the actual existence
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:51.560]   of consciousness or intelligence or any of that.
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:53.560]   What I really mean is,
[02:53:53.560 --> 02:54:00.720]   the more the appearance starts to look like the thing,
[02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:03.400]   the more there's this area where it's like,
[02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:04.760]   I don't think,
[02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:11.880]   our whole idea of what is real and what is just an illusion
[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:16.760]   is not the right way to think about it.
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:18.760]   So the whole idea is like,
[02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:22.920]   if you create a system that looks like it's having fun,
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:27.240]   the more it's realistically able to portray itself
[02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:31.160]   as having fun, there's a certain gray area
[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:33.760]   which the system is having fun.
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:36.640]   And same with intelligence, same with consciousness.
[02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:40.000]   And we humans wanna simplify,
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000]   like it feels like the way we simplify the existence
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.080]   and the illusion of something
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:50.480]   is missing the whole truth of the nature of reality,
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:52.600]   which we're not yet able to understand.
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:55.520]   Like it's the 1%, we only understand 1% currently,
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:59.160]   so we don't have the right physics to talk about things,
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:00.960]   we don't have the right science to talk about things.
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:05.440]   But to me, like the faking it
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:08.460]   and actually it being true is,
[02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:12.800]   the difference is much smaller
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:14.760]   than what humans would like to imagine.
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:18.520]   That's my intuition, but philosophers hate that
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:21.240]   because, and guess what?
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:23.640]   It's philosophers, what have you actually built?
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:25.120]   (Lex laughing)
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:27.280]   So like to me, that's the difference
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:28.840]   between philosophy and engineering.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:32.920]   It feels like if we push the creation, the engineering,
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:35.160]   like fake it until you make it all the way,
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:37.120]   which is like fake consciousness
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:41.280]   until you realize, holy crap, this thing is conscious.
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:43.480]   Fake intelligence until you realize, holy crap,
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:44.560]   this is intelligence.
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:48.360]   And from my curiosity with psychedelics
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:52.000]   and just neurobiology, neuroscience,
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.680]   is like it feels, I love the armchair.
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:57.540]   I love sitting in that armchair
[02:55:57.540 --> 02:55:59.540]   because it feels like at a certain point,
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:01.920]   you're going to think about this problem
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:04.120]   and there's going to be an aha moment.
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.760]   Like that's what the armchair does.
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:10.560]   Sometimes science prevents you from really thinking, wait.
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:14.400]   Like it's really simple.
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:15.880]   There's something really simple.
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:20.880]   Like there's some, there could be some dance of chemicals
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:22.320]   that we're totally unaware of.
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:26.760]   Not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:29.320]   with which biological architectures,
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.920]   but more like we were thinking of it completely wrong.
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:38.720]   That, just out of the blue, like maybe the human mind
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:44.160]   is just like a radio that tunes into some other medium
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:46.080]   where consciousness actually exists.
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:49.640]   Like those weird sort of hypothetical,
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.140]   but maybe we're just thinking about the human mind
[02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:53.280]   totally wrong.
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:56.860]   Maybe there's no such thing as individual intelligence.
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:00.240]   Maybe it is all collective intelligence between humans.
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:02.280]   Like maybe the intelligence is possessed
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:05.560]   in the communication of language between minds
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:08.120]   and then in fact consciousness is a property
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:13.120]   of that language versus a property of the individual minds.
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:15.760]   And somehow the neurotransmitters will be able
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:16.600]   to connect to that.
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:21.160]   So then AI systems can join that common collective
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:23.240]   intelligence, that common language.
[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:25.400]   You know, like just thinking completely outside of the box.
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:26.760]   I just said a bunch of crazy things.
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:29.840]   I don't know, but thinking outside the box
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.280]   and there's something about subtle manipulation
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:38.280]   of the chemicals of the brain which feels like the best
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:43.200]   or one of the great chances of the scientific process
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:46.840]   leading us to an actual understanding of the hard problem.
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:50.480]   - So I am very hopeful that, and so I,
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:52.240]   I mean, I'm a radical empiricist,
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:54.160]   which I'm very strong with that.
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:57.960]   Like that's what, you know, so science isn't about
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:57:59.960]   ultimately being a materialist.
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:02.720]   It's like, it's about being an empiricist in my view.
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:04.520]   And so for example, I'm very fascinated
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:06.400]   by the so-called psi phenomenon.
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:08.320]   You know, like stuff that people just kind of reject
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:09.180]   out of hand.
[02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:12.840]   You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:16.560]   with an idea of, you know, hey, look, you know,
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:19.840]   what we consider, like anything exists as natural.
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:23.480]   And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature,
[02:58:23.480 --> 02:58:26.480]   like what we recognize as in nature moves,
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:28.760]   like what we do today and what we know today
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:31.280]   would only be described as magic 500 years ago
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:32.840]   or even a hundred years ago, some of it.
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:36.080]   So there will surely be things that,
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:37.760]   like you explained these phenomenon
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:39.560]   that just sound like completely,
[02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:41.200]   they're supernatural now,
[02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:42.960]   where there may be for some of it,
[02:58:42.960 --> 02:58:44.800]   like some of it might turn out to be a complete bunk
[02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:47.120]   and some of it might turn out to be,
[02:58:47.120 --> 02:58:49.120]   it's just another layer of nature,
[02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:50.960]   whether we're talking about multiple dimensions
[02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:51.800]   that were invoked or something
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:53.680]   where we don't even have the language to work.
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:55.560]   And what you're saying about the moving together
[02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:58.820]   of the model and the real thing of conscious,
[02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:00.720]   like I'm very sympathetic to that.
[02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:03.240]   So that's that part of like on the armchair side
[02:59:03.240 --> 02:59:06.160]   where I wanna be clear, I can't say this as a scientist,
[02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:07.860]   but just in terms of speculating,
[02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:11.160]   I find myself attracted to these
[02:59:11.160 --> 02:59:15.720]   more of the sort of the panpsychism ideas.
[02:59:15.720 --> 02:59:17.560]   And that kind of makes sense to me.
[02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:18.960]   I don't know if that's what you meant there,
[02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:22.680]   but it seemed like related the sense that ultimately,
[02:59:22.680 --> 02:59:26.840]   if you were completely modeling,
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:28.920]   like it's like if you completely modeling,
[02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:31.360]   unless you dismiss like the idea
[02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:33.040]   that there is a phenomenal consciousness,
[02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:34.440]   which I think is hard given that we all,
[02:59:34.440 --> 02:59:37.400]   I seem like I have one, that's really all I know,
[02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:41.520]   but that's so compelling, I can't just dismiss that.
[02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:44.880]   Like if you take that as a given,
[02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:49.000]   then the only way for the model and the real thing to merge
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:54.000]   is if there is something baked into the nature of reality,
[02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:58.320]   sort of like in the history of like there are certain
[02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:00.840]   just like fundamental forces or fundamental,
[03:00:00.840 --> 03:00:03.240]   like, and that's been useful for us.
[03:00:03.240 --> 03:00:04.480]   And sometimes we find out
[03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:05.640]   that that's pointing towards something else
[03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:09.280]   or sometimes it's still, seems like it's a fundamental
[03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:11.040]   and sometimes it's a placeholder for someone to figure out,
[03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:13.120]   but there's something like, this is just a given,
[03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:16.200]   this is just, and sometimes someone like gravity
[03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:17.360]   seems like a very good placeholder
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:19.760]   and then there's something better that comes to replace it.
[03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:23.200]   So, I kind of think about like consciousness
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.120]   and I didn't, I kind of had this inclination
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:27.080]   before I knew there was a term for it,
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:29.920]   Rossellian monism, the idea that,
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:32.600]   which is a form of, again, I'm not,
[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:35.600]   I'm an armchair philosopher, not a very good one.
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:37.120]   - Broadly panpsychism, by the way,
[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:40.440]   is the idea that sort of consciousness permeates all matter
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:44.640]   and it's a fundamental part of physics
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:45.960]   of the universe kind of thing.
[03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:49.120]   So, and there's a lot of different flavors of it
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:51.240]   as you're alluding to.
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:53.560]   - And something that struck me as like consistent
[03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:56.560]   with some just, you know, inclinations of mine,
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:00.400]   just total speculation is this idea of
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:04.080]   everything we know in science
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:06.440]   and with most of the stuff we think of physics,
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:10.840]   you know, really describes, it's all interactions.
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:13.840]   It's not the thing itself.
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:18.840]   Like there is something to the,
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:20.240]   and this sounds very new agey,
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:22.000]   which is why it's very difficult
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:25.000]   and I have high bullshit like meter and everything,
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.560]   but like an isness.
[03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:28.000]   I mean, I think about like Huxley,
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.160]   Aldous Huxley with his mescaline experience
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:32.640]   in "Doors of Perception," like there's an isness there
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:37.640]   and Alan Watson, like there is a nature of being,
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:39.240]   again, very new agey sounding,
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:40.960]   but maybe there is something to,
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:43.320]   and when we say consciousness,
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:45.200]   we think of like this human experience,
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:47.480]   but maybe that's just, that's so processed
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:50.960]   and so that's so far,
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:53.680]   so derivative of this kind of basic thing
[03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:55.640]   that we wouldn't even recognize the basic thing,
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:57.520]   but the basic thing might just be,
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:00.520]   this is not about the interaction between particles.
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:05.520]   This is what it is like to exist as a particle
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:07.640]   and maybe it's not even particles.
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:09.640]   Maybe it's like space-time itself.
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:11.760]   I mean, again, totally in the speculation area.
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:13.160]   - And something out there in space-time.
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:16.160]   So it's funny 'cause we don't have neither the science
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:18.560]   nor the proper language to talk about it.
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:21.120]   All we have is kind of little intuitions
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:23.840]   about there might be something
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:26.840]   in that direction of the darkness to pursue.
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:31.400]   And in that sense, I find panpsychism interesting
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:35.480]   in that it does feel like there's something
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:39.360]   fundamental here, that consciousness is not just like,
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:40.760]   okay, so the flip side,
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:43.800]   consciousness could be just a very basic
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:48.560]   and trivial symptom, like a little hack of nature
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:53.360]   that's useful for survival of an organism.
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:55.200]   It's not something fundamental.
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:03:00.200]   It's just this very basic, boring chemical thing
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:03.280]   that somehow has convinced us humans,
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:06.680]   'cause we're very human-centric, we're very self-centric,
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:08.320]   that this is somehow really important,
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:10.480]   but it's actually pretty obvious.
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:13.480]   But, or it could be something really fundamental
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:15.320]   to the nature of the universe.
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:18.600]   So both of those are, to me, pretty compelling
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:21.680]   and I think eventually scientifically testable.
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:24.040]   It is so frustrating that it's hard to design
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:25.880]   a scientific experiment currently,
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:29.560]   but I think that's how Nobel Prizes are won,
[03:03:29.560 --> 03:03:32.400]   is nobody did it until they do it.
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:36.680]   - The reason I lean towards, and again, armchair spec,
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:39.960]   if I had to bet like $1,000
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:41.560]   on which one of these ultimately would be proven,
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:44.600]   I would lean towards, I'd put my bets
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:49.600]   on something like panpsychism rather than the emergence
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:52.560]   of phenomenal consciousness through complexity
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:55.200]   or computational complexity.
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:57.080]   Because, although certainly,
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:01.200]   if there is some underlying fundamental consciousness,
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.360]   it's clearly being processed in this way,
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:08.480]   through computation, in terms of resulting
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:10.200]   in our experience and the experience,
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:11.400]   presumably, of other animals.
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:14.420]   But the reason I would bet on panpsychism is, to me,
[03:04:14.420 --> 03:04:18.880]   Occam's razor, it just, in terms of truly the hard problem,
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:22.360]   like at some point you have an inside looking out.
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:23.800]   And even looking refers to vision,
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:25.640]   and it doesn't, that's just an,
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:29.880]   but just there's an inside experiencing something.
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:34.760]   At some point of complexity, all of a sudden,
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:36.480]   you start from this objective universe,
[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:37.880]   and all we know about is interactions
[03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:39.680]   between things, and things happen.
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:42.200]   And at this certain level of complexity,
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:44.200]   magically, there's an inside.
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:48.800]   That, to me, doesn't pass Occam's razor as easily
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:53.800]   as maybe there is a fundamental property of the universe.
[03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:56.680]   There's both subjective and objective.
[03:04:56.680 --> 03:04:58.820]   There's both interactions amongst things,
[03:04:58.820 --> 03:05:02.640]   and there is the thing itself.
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:04.240]   - Yes. - But, yeah.
[03:05:04.240 --> 03:05:05.640]   - So, I'm of two minds.
[03:05:05.640 --> 03:05:08.040]   I agree with you totally, half my mind.
[03:05:08.040 --> 03:05:10.000]   And the other half is I've seen,
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.040]   looking at cellular automata a lot,
[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:16.720]   which is, it sure does seem that we don't understand
[03:05:16.720 --> 03:05:18.240]   anything about complexity.
[03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:21.520]   Like the emergence, just the property.
[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:25.960]   In fact, that could be a fundamental property of reality,
[03:05:25.960 --> 03:05:28.200]   is something within the emergence
[03:05:28.200 --> 03:05:30.420]   from simple things interacting,
[03:05:30.420 --> 03:05:33.440]   somehow miraculous things happen.
[03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:36.120]   And like that, I don't understand that.
[03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:40.160]   That could be fundamental, that like,
[03:05:40.160 --> 03:05:44.280]   something about the layers of abstraction,
[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:46.800]   like layers of reality,
[03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:48.800]   like really small things interacting,
[03:05:48.800 --> 03:05:53.800]   and then on another layer emerges actual complicated behavior
[03:05:53.800 --> 03:05:57.120]   even on the underlying thing is super simple.
[03:05:57.120 --> 03:06:00.160]   Like that process, we don't really don't understand either.
[03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:02.920]   And that could be bigger than any of the things
[03:06:02.920 --> 03:06:04.800]   we're talking about.
[03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:07.880]   That's the basic force behind everything
[03:06:07.880 --> 03:06:09.640]   that's happening in the universe,
[03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:14.640]   is from simple things, complex phenomena can happen.
[03:06:16.600 --> 03:06:19.320]   - And the thing that gives me pause
[03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:24.320]   is that I'm concerned about a threshold there.
[03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:26.240]   Like, how is it likely that,
[03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:28.840]   now there may be, and there may be some qualitative shift
[03:06:28.840 --> 03:06:30.480]   that in the realm of like,
[03:06:30.480 --> 03:06:32.880]   we don't even understand complexity yet,
[03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:34.840]   like you're saying, like, so maybe there is,
[03:06:34.840 --> 03:06:38.120]   but I do think like if it is a result of the complexity,
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:41.480]   well, just having helium versus hydrogen
[03:06:41.480 --> 03:06:43.040]   is a form of complexity.
[03:06:43.040 --> 03:06:45.880]   Having the existence of stars versus clouds of gas
[03:06:45.880 --> 03:06:46.720]   is a complexity.
[03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:50.640]   The entire universe has been this increasing complexity.
[03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:53.320]   And so that kind of brings me back to then the other
[03:06:53.320 --> 03:06:57.240]   of like, okay, if it's about complexity,
[03:06:57.240 --> 03:06:59.880]   then it exists at a certain level
[03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:02.600]   in these simple systems like a star,
[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:05.440]   or a more complex atom.
[03:07:05.440 --> 03:07:06.920]   - Panpsychism, that's right.
[03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:09.640]   But we humans, the qualitative shift,
[03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:12.920]   we might have evolved to appreciate
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:14.440]   certain kinds of thresholds.
[03:07:14.440 --> 03:07:15.400]   - Right. - Yeah.
[03:07:15.400 --> 03:07:18.480]   - I do think it's likely that this idea that,
[03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:20.200]   whether or not there's an inner experience,
[03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:22.400]   which is phenomenal, it's the hard problem,
[03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:26.520]   that acting like an agent, like having an algorithm
[03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:29.480]   that basically like operates as if there is an agent,
[03:07:29.480 --> 03:07:32.920]   that's clearly a thing that I think has worked.
[03:07:32.920 --> 03:07:35.840]   And that there is a whole lot to figure out there
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:40.320]   that, and I think psychedelics will be extremely helpful
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:43.240]   in figuring more out about that,
[03:07:43.240 --> 03:07:47.360]   because they do seem to a lot of times eliminate that,
[03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:51.560]   or whatever, radically shift that sense of self.
[03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:53.320]   - Let me ask the craziest question.
[03:07:53.320 --> 03:07:54.960]   Indulge me for a second.
[03:07:54.960 --> 03:07:57.440]   This is a joke.
[03:07:57.440 --> 03:07:58.640]   - You're tired of what we've been talking about?
[03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:00.680]   Like, okay, I gotta get my seatbelt on.
[03:08:00.680 --> 03:08:02.600]   - All of this is a science,
[03:08:02.600 --> 03:08:05.840]   all of that, despite the caveats about armchair,
[03:08:05.840 --> 03:08:08.720]   I think is within the reach of science.
[03:08:08.720 --> 03:08:11.840]   Let me ask one that's kind of also within the reach
[03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:14.000]   of science, but as Joe likes to say,
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:15.640]   it's entirely possible, right?
[03:08:15.640 --> 03:08:21.480]   Is it possible that with these DMT trips,
[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:26.480]   when you meet entities, is it possible that these entities
[03:08:26.480 --> 03:08:29.560]   are extraterrestrial life forms?
[03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:33.200]   Like, our understanding of little green men
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:36.580]   with aliens that show up is totally off.
[03:08:36.580 --> 03:08:37.880]   I often think about this, like,
[03:08:37.880 --> 03:08:42.880]   what would actual extraterrestrial intelligence look like?
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:47.960]   And my sense is it would look like very different
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:51.520]   from anything we can even begin to comprehend.
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:52.880]   - And how would it communicate?
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:53.720]   - And how would it communicate?
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:55.360]   - Yes, would it be necessarily spaceships
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:57.080]   with the Ursula travel or?
[03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:00.040]   - Could it be communicating through chemicals,
[03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:03.480]   through, if there's the panpsychism situation,
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:07.480]   if there's something, not if, I almost for sure know
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:11.360]   we don't understand a lot about the function of our mind
[03:09:11.360 --> 03:09:16.240]   in connection to the fabric of the physics in the universe.
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:18.600]   A lot of people seem to think we have theoretical physics
[03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:20.020]   pretty figured out.
[03:09:20.020 --> 03:09:22.720]   I have my doubts, because I'm pretty sure
[03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:24.640]   it always feels like we have everything figured out
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:25.480]   until we don't.
[03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:28.160]   - Right, I mean, there's no grand unifying theory yet,
[03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:30.600]   right, that's been widely recognized.
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:32.600]   - We could be missing out, like,
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:36.040]   the concept of the universe just can be completely off.
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:38.680]   Like, how many other universes are there,
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:40.500]   all those kinds of things.
[03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:43.520]   I mean, just the basic nature of information,
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:47.840]   the time, all of those things.
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:48.680]   - Yeah.
[03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:50.600]   - Yeah, whether that's just like a thing
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:53.700]   we assign value to, or whether it's fundamental or not,
[03:09:53.700 --> 03:09:56.160]   that's a whole chunk.
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:09:58.160]   I could talk to Shankara forever about whether time
[03:09:58.160 --> 03:10:01.120]   is emergent or fundamental to the reality.
[03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:04.240]   But is it possible that the entities we meet
[03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:06.600]   are actual alien life forms?
[03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:08.160]   Do you ever think about that?
[03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:10.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.
[03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:13.400]   And I've, to some degree, laid my cards out
[03:10:13.400 --> 03:10:15.840]   by identifying as a radical empiricist.
[03:10:15.840 --> 03:10:18.600]   So the answer, is it possible?
[03:10:18.600 --> 03:10:21.400]   And I think, ultimately, if you're a good scientist,
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:26.400]   you gotta say, now that's at the extremes, it's a yes.
[03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:28.400]   And it might get more interesting when you had to,
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:31.280]   you're asked to guess about the probability of that.
[03:10:31.280 --> 03:10:34.520]   Is that a one in a million, one in a trillion,
[03:10:34.520 --> 03:10:38.240]   one in a, one in more than the number of atoms
[03:10:38.240 --> 03:10:41.040]   in the universe probability?
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:44.500]   - And as an empiricist, it's like, what is a good testable?
[03:10:44.500 --> 03:10:47.240]   Like, how would you know the answer to that question?
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:49.480]   Or how would you be able to validate it?
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:52.520]   - Well, can you get some information that's verifiable,
[03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:57.520]   like information about some other planet,
[03:10:58.520 --> 03:11:02.200]   or some aspect, some, and gosh,
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:03.480]   it would be an interesting range,
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:06.480]   but what range of discovery that we can anticipate
[03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:10.120]   we're gonna know within, you know, whatever,
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:13.440]   a few years, next five, 10, 20 years,
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:17.040]   and seeing if you can get that information now,
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:20.200]   and then over time, it might be verified.
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:22.200]   You know, the type of thing like, you know,
[03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:24.880]   part of Einstein's work was ultimately verified,
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:26.480]   not until decades and decades later,
[03:11:26.480 --> 03:11:31.480]   at least certain aspects through empirical observations.
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:34.600]   - But it's also possible that the alien beings
[03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:36.480]   have a very different value system
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:37.680]   and perception of the world,
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:40.520]   where all of this little capitalistic improvements
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:42.600]   that we're all after, like predicting,
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:45.320]   the concept of predicting the future too,
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:50.160]   is like totally useless to other life forms
[03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:56.160]   that have, that perhaps think in a much different way,
[03:11:56.480 --> 03:11:58.960]   maybe a more transcendent way, I don't know, but.
[03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:00.640]   - So they wouldn't even sign the consent form
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:03.040]   to be a participant in our experiment.
[03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:05.840]   - They would not, they would not.
[03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:06.960]   And they wouldn't even understand
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:08.240]   the nature of these experiments.
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:13.240]   I mean, maybe it's purely in the realm of the consciousness
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:16.760]   that we talked about.
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:20.880]   So communicating in a way that is totally different
[03:12:20.880 --> 03:12:22.120]   than the kinds of communication
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:24.200]   that we think of as on Earth.
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:27.840]   Like what's the purpose of communication for us?
[03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:30.240]   For us humans, the purpose of communication
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:32.960]   is sharing ideas, it feels like.
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:37.840]   Like converging, like it's the Dawkins memes.
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:41.600]   It's like we're sharing ideas in order to figure out
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:45.920]   how to collaborate together to get food into our systems
[03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:49.080]   and procreate and then murder everybody
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:52.640]   in the neighboring tribe because they'll steal our food.
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:54.880]   Like we are all about sharing ideas.
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:12:59.800]   Maybe it's possible to have another alien life form
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:02.100]   that's more about sharing experiences.
[03:13:02.100 --> 03:13:05.880]   Like it's less about ideas, I don't know.
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:07.880]   - And maybe that'll be us in a few years.
[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:08.720]   How could it not?
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:11.800]   Like instead of explaining something laboriously to you,
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:12.960]   like having people describe
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:14.800]   the ineffable psychedelic experience,
[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:17.160]   like if we could record that
[03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:19.880]   and then get the Neuralink of 50 years from now,
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:21.560]   like oh, just plug this into your--
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:22.880]   - Just transfer in the-- - Yeah, it's like,
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:24.920]   oh, now you feel what it's like.
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:27.600]   And like in one sense, like how could we not go there?
[03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:28.640]   And then you get into the realm,
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:30.080]   especially when you throw time into it,
[03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:32.480]   are the aliens us in the future?
[03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:35.380]   Or even like a transcendental temporal,
[03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:37.440]   like the us beyond time?
[03:13:37.440 --> 03:13:39.320]   Like I don't know, like you get into this realm
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:41.080]   and there's a lot of possibilities.
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:45.360]   Yeah, but I think there's one psychedelic researcher
[03:13:45.360 --> 03:13:49.240]   who did high-dose DMT research in the '90s
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:50.820]   who speculated that,
[03:13:50.820 --> 03:13:54.120]   that, and there was a lot of alien encounter experiences,
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:13:57.480]   like maybe these are like entities
[03:13:57.480 --> 03:13:59.160]   from some other dimension or--
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:00.160]   - Jared-- - He labeled it
[03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:02.160]   as speculation, but you know.
[03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:03.760]   - Do you remember the name?
[03:14:03.760 --> 03:14:04.800]   - Oh, Rick Strassman.
[03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:06.480]   - Oh, Rick Strassman. - Who did, yeah, yeah,
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:07.720]   the DMT work.
[03:14:07.720 --> 03:14:11.600]   He labeled it as speculation, but you know, I think that,
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:17.120]   yeah, I think we'd be wise to kind of, you know,
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:21.920]   it's always that balance between being empirically grounded
[03:14:21.920 --> 03:14:23.680]   and skeptical, but also not being,
[03:14:23.680 --> 03:14:27.880]   and I think in science, well, often we are too closed.
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:29.500]   Which relates to like, you're talking about Elon,
[03:14:29.500 --> 03:14:31.760]   like in academia, it's like often,
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:33.280]   like I think you're punished for thinking
[03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:35.040]   or even talking about 20 years from now
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.520]   because it's just so far removed from your next grant
[03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:41.920]   or for your next paper that you're, it's easy pickings.
[03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:45.280]   And you know, that you're not allowed to speculate, so.
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:49.200]   - I think I'm a huge fan of, I think the best way,
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:52.880]   to me at least, to practice like science
[03:14:52.880 --> 03:14:57.280]   or to practice good engineering is to like do two things
[03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:00.400]   and just bounce off, like spend most of the time
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:03.500]   doing the rigor of the day-to-day
[03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:05.720]   of what can be accomplished now in the engineering space
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:08.000]   or in the science, like what can actually,
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.560]   what can you construct an experiment around,
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:14.040]   do like that, the usual rigor of the scientific process,
[03:15:14.040 --> 03:15:17.600]   but then every once in a while on a regular basis
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:21.920]   to step outside and talk about aliens and consciousness
[03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:25.440]   and we just walk along the line of things
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:27.800]   that are outside the reach of science currently.
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:33.640]   Free will, the illusion or the perception
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:37.720]   of the experience of free will, of anything,
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:41.680]   just the entirety of it, being able to travel in time
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:45.480]   through warm holes, it's like it's really useful to do that,
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:49.320]   especially as a scientist, like if that's all you do,
[03:15:49.320 --> 03:15:53.120]   you go into a land where you're not actually able
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:54.180]   to think rigorously.
[03:15:54.180 --> 03:15:56.440]   There's something, at least to me,
[03:15:56.440 --> 03:15:59.200]   that if you just hop back and forth,
[03:15:59.200 --> 03:16:03.440]   you're able to, I think, do exactly the kind of injection
[03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:07.600]   of out-of-the-box thinking to your regular day-to-day
[03:16:07.600 --> 03:16:11.440]   science that will ultimately lead to breakthroughs.
[03:16:11.440 --> 03:16:15.160]   But you have to be the good scientist most of the time.
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:17.120]   - And that's consistent with what I think
[03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:19.480]   the great scientists of history,
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:24.480]   like in most of the history, the greats,
[03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:29.480]   the Newtons and Einsteins, I mean, they were,
[03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:31.400]   there was less of, and this changed, I think,
[03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:33.720]   as time marched on, but less of a separation
[03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:34.760]   between those realms.
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:36.720]   It's like there's the inclination now
[03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:39.560]   for it's like as a scientist,
[03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:42.640]   and this is science, this is my work,
[03:16:42.640 --> 03:16:44.800]   and then this, my inclination is to say,
[03:16:44.800 --> 03:16:46.360]   oh, Lex, don't take me too seriously
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:47.340]   'cause this is my armchair.
[03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:48.520]   I'm not speaking as a scientist.
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:52.780]   I'm bending over backwards to say, to divide that self,
[03:16:52.780 --> 03:16:54.240]   and maybe there's been less of,
[03:16:54.240 --> 03:16:55.800]   there's been that evolution,
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:17:00.280]   and the greats didn't see that.
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:02.160]   I mean, Newton, and you go back in time,
[03:17:02.160 --> 03:17:04.560]   and it's like that obviously connects to then religion,
[03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:05.920]   especially if that is the predominant world,
[03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:07.800]   or Newton, like how much,
[03:17:07.800 --> 03:17:11.840]   how much time did he spend trying to decode the Bible
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:14.360]   and whatnot, and then maybe that was a dead end,
[03:17:14.360 --> 03:17:17.040]   but it's like if you really believe in that,
[03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:20.200]   in that particular religion, and you're this mastermind,
[03:17:20.200 --> 03:17:22.360]   and you're trying to figure things out,
[03:17:22.360 --> 03:17:24.600]   it's not like, oh, this is what my job description is,
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:25.660]   and this is what the grant wants.
[03:17:25.660 --> 03:17:28.560]   It's like, no, I've got this limited time on the planet.
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:30.920]   I'm gonna figure out as much stuff as possible.
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:32.360]   Nothing is off the table,
[03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:34.560]   and you're just putting it all together,
[03:17:34.560 --> 03:17:35.880]   so this is kind of this trajectory
[03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:38.960]   is really related to the siloing in science,
[03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:42.880]   like again, related to my, oh, I'm not a philosopher,
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:45.700]   whether you consider that a science,
[03:17:45.700 --> 03:17:47.080]   or not empirical science,
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:49.240]   but going to these different disciplines,
[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:53.080]   like the greats didn't observe the,
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:55.280]   boundaries didn't exist, and they didn't observe them.
[03:17:55.280 --> 03:18:00.280]   - Yeah, so speaking of the finiteness of our existence
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:07.440]   in this world, so on the front of psychedelics,
[03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:11.020]   and teaching you lessons as a researcher, as a human being,
[03:18:11.020 --> 03:18:16.080]   what have you learned about death, about mortality,
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:18.520]   about the finiteness of our existence?
[03:18:18.520 --> 03:18:21.760]   Are you yourself afraid of death,
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:25.840]   and how has your view, do you ponder it,
[03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:28.340]   and has your view of your mortality changed
[03:18:28.340 --> 03:18:30.360]   with the research you've done?
[03:18:30.360 --> 03:18:34.240]   - Yeah, yeah, so I do ponder it, and--
[03:18:34.240 --> 03:18:35.120]   - Are you afraid of death?
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:37.760]   - Probably on a daily basis I ponder it.
[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:40.140]   I'd have to pick it apart more and say,
[03:18:40.140 --> 03:18:46.080]   yeah, I am afraid of dying, the process of dying.
[03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:48.840]   I'm not afraid of being dead.
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:50.800]   I mean, I'm not afraid of, I think it was Penn Jillette
[03:18:50.800 --> 03:18:53.440]   that said, and he may have gotten it from someone else,
[03:18:53.440 --> 03:18:58.440]   but I'm not afraid of the year 1862, before I existed.
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:02.560]   I'm not afraid of the year 2262, after I'm gone.
[03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:06.200]   It's gonna be fine, but yeah, dying,
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:11.040]   I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of dying.
[03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:13.520]   And so there's both the process of dying,
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:15.260]   like, yeah, it's usually not good.
[03:19:15.260 --> 03:19:18.760]   It'd be nice if it was after many, many years,
[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:23.560]   and just sort of, I'd rather not fall, die in my sleep.
[03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:24.760]   I'd rather kind of be conscious,
[03:19:24.760 --> 03:19:26.960]   but sort of just fade out with old age maybe,
[03:19:26.960 --> 03:19:31.800]   but just being in an accident and horrible diseases.
[03:19:31.800 --> 03:19:33.180]   I've seen enough loved ones.
[03:19:33.180 --> 03:19:34.400]   It's like, yeah, this is not good.
[03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:39.400]   This is enough to be, I'd like to say that I'm peaceful
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:41.640]   and sort of balanced enough that I'm not concerned at all,
[03:19:41.640 --> 03:19:44.400]   but no, like, yeah, I'm afraid of dying.
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:47.720]   But I'm also concerned about, I think about family.
[03:19:47.720 --> 03:19:54.640]   I'm afraid or at least concerned about not being there,
[03:19:55.640 --> 03:19:57.760]   like with a three-year-old, not being there,
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:20:01.920]   not being there for him and my wife and my mom
[03:20:01.920 --> 03:20:03.880]   the rest of her life.
[03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:06.680]   I'm concerned about not, I'm concerned more about
[03:20:06.680 --> 03:20:10.040]   the harm that it would cause if I left prematurely.
[03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:11.760]   And then kind of even bigger along the lines
[03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:13.240]   of some of the stuff that Ford,
[03:20:13.240 --> 03:20:14.120]   I think we've been talking about,
[03:20:14.120 --> 03:20:17.960]   I think maybe way too much about just like,
[03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:19.940]   and I'll never know the answer.
[03:20:19.940 --> 03:20:22.320]   So even if I lived to 120,
[03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:24.460]   but I wanna know as much as I can,
[03:20:24.460 --> 03:20:28.720]   but like, how is this gonna work out like as humans?
[03:20:28.720 --> 03:20:30.720]   Are we, and a big one, I think is, are we gonna,
[03:20:30.720 --> 03:20:33.320]   and I don't think, unfortunately, I'm gonna learn it
[03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:37.280]   in my lifetime, even if I live to a ripe old age,
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:38.840]   but I don't know.
[03:20:38.840 --> 03:20:39.880]   Is this gonna work out?
[03:20:39.880 --> 03:20:41.680]   Like, are we gonna escape the planet?
[03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:42.920]   I think that's one of the biggies.
[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:45.220]   Like, are we gonna like, the survival of the,
[03:20:45.220 --> 03:20:48.560]   like, I think the next, like the time we're in now,
[03:20:48.560 --> 03:20:51.000]   it's like with the nuclear weapons, with pandemics
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:54.440]   and with, I mean, we're gonna get to the point
[03:20:54.440 --> 03:20:57.520]   where anyone can build a hydrogen bomb.
[03:20:57.520 --> 03:21:00.200]   Like, you know, it's like, you just like the,
[03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:02.000]   or engineer like the, you know,
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:03.760]   something that's a million times worse than COVID
[03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:04.600]   and then just spread it.
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:06.980]   It's like, we're getting to this period of,
[03:21:06.980 --> 03:21:09.160]   and then not to mention climate change, you know,
[03:21:09.160 --> 03:21:10.920]   it's like, although I think that's not,
[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:12.680]   there's probably gonna be surviving humans
[03:21:12.680 --> 03:21:15.440]   with that regard, you know, but it could be really bad.
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:17.960]   But these existential threats,
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:19.700]   I think the only real guarantee
[03:21:19.700 --> 03:21:22.120]   that we're gonna get another, you name it,
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:26.880]   thousand, million, whatever years is like diversity,
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:31.440]   diversify our portfolio, get off the planet, you know,
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:33.120]   don't leave this one, hopefully we keep, you know,
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:36.400]   but like, and I, you know,
[03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:38.640]   it's like either we're gonna get snuffed out
[03:21:38.640 --> 03:21:42.440]   like really quickly, or we're gonna,
[03:21:42.440 --> 03:21:44.040]   like if we reach that point
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:46.880]   and it's gonna be over the next like 100, 200 years,
[03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:51.880]   like we're probably gonna survive like until like,
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:54.160]   I mean, you know, like our sun,
[03:21:54.160 --> 03:21:55.240]   like, and even beyond that,
[03:21:55.240 --> 03:21:57.600]   like we're probably gonna be talking about millions
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:21:58.640]   and millions of years.
[03:21:58.640 --> 03:22:01.840]   It's like, and we're, I don't know,
[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:04.280]   in terms of the planet, four billion years into this.
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:06.120]   And depending on how you count our species, you know,
[03:22:06.120 --> 03:22:08.920]   we're, you know, we're millions of years into this.
[03:22:08.920 --> 03:22:11.680]   And it's like, it's just like the point of the relay race
[03:22:11.680 --> 03:22:13.760]   where we can really screw up.
[03:22:13.760 --> 03:22:15.280]   - So that would make you feel pretty good
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:19.080]   when you're on your deathbed at 120 years old
[03:22:19.080 --> 03:22:21.560]   and there's something hopeful about,
[03:22:21.560 --> 03:22:24.800]   there's a colony starting up on Mars and it's like.
[03:22:24.800 --> 03:22:27.320]   - Yeah, Titan, like whatever, you know, like, yeah,
[03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:29.360]   like that we have these colonies out there
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:32.120]   that would tell me like, yeah,
[03:22:32.120 --> 03:22:35.280]   then at least we'd be good until like the, you know,
[03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:39.480]   hopefully, probably until the sun goes red giant,
[03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:40.400]   you know what I mean?
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:43.160]   Rather than, oh, like 20 years from now
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:45.360]   when there's some, someone with their finger
[03:22:45.360 --> 03:22:47.240]   on the nuclear button that just, you know,
[03:22:47.240 --> 03:22:50.960]   misperceives, you know, the radar, you know,
[03:22:50.960 --> 03:22:54.400]   like the signal they think Russia's attacking,
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:22:56.160]   they're really not or China.
[03:22:56.160 --> 03:22:59.240]   And like, that's probably how a nuclear accident war
[03:22:59.240 --> 03:23:01.560]   is gonna start rather than, you know,
[03:23:01.560 --> 03:23:03.960]   or the, like I said, these other horrible things.
[03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:07.800]   - Does it not make you sad that you won't be there
[03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:10.560]   if we are successful at proliferating
[03:23:10.560 --> 03:23:13.720]   throughout the observable universe,
[03:23:13.720 --> 03:23:17.720]   that you won't be there to experience any of it?
[03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:18.760]   - Yeah. - It's just the ego death,
[03:23:18.760 --> 03:23:19.600]   right?
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:21.840]   - Yeah, the death 'cause you're still gonna die
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:23.440]   and it's still gonna be over.
[03:23:23.440 --> 03:23:26.320]   - Right. - That's, you know,
[03:23:26.320 --> 03:23:30.120]   Ernest Becker and those folks really emphasize
[03:23:30.120 --> 03:23:33.760]   the terror of death that if we're honest,
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:36.040]   we'll discover if we search within ourselves,
[03:23:36.040 --> 03:23:38.800]   which is like, this thing is gonna be over.
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:43.800]   Most of our existence is based on the illusion
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:46.960]   that it's gonna go forever.
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:48.960]   And when you sort of realize
[03:23:48.960 --> 03:23:50.400]   it's actually gonna be over,
[03:23:50.400 --> 03:23:53.200]   like today, like I might murder you
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:54.800]   at the end of this conversation.
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:57.040]   (laughing)
[03:23:57.040 --> 03:24:01.920]   It might be over today or like you on going home,
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:04.000]   this might be your last day on this earth.
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:09.000]   And it's, I mean, like pondering that,
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:13.400]   I suppose one thing to be,
[03:24:13.400 --> 03:24:17.080]   if I were to push back, it's interesting,
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:22.240]   is you actually, I think you seek comfort
[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:25.840]   in the sadness of how unfortunate it would be
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:28.080]   for your family to not have you.
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:31.080]   Because the really, even the deeper,
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:34.080]   yes, but that's the simple fear.
[03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:36.360]   Even the deeper terror is like,
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:41.360]   like this thing doesn't last forever.
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:43.160]   Like I think, I don't know,
[03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:47.400]   like it's hard to put the right words to it,
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:52.400]   but it feels like that's not truly acknowledged
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:55.680]   by us, by each of us.
[03:24:55.680 --> 03:24:58.680]   - Yeah, I think this is the,
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:00.000]   getting back to the psychedelics
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:02.600]   in terms of the people in our work with cancer patients
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:05.320]   who we had psilocybin sessions to help them,
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:07.300]   and it did substantially help them,
[03:25:07.300 --> 03:25:11.000]   the vast majority, in terms of dealing
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:12.480]   with these existential issues.
[03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:14.080]   And I think, it's something we,
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:16.880]   I could say that I really feel that I've come along
[03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:19.720]   in that both being with folks who have died
[03:25:19.720 --> 03:25:22.520]   that are close to me, and then also that work,
[03:25:22.520 --> 03:25:24.840]   I think are the two biggies, and sort of like,
[03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:28.640]   I think I've come along in that sort of acceptance
[03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:32.480]   of this, like it's not gonna last.
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:34.800]   Whether at the personal level
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:35.960]   or even at the species level,
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:38.480]   like at some point, all the stars are gonna fade out,
[03:25:38.480 --> 03:25:39.640]   and it's gonna be the realm of,
[03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:41.720]   which is gonna be the vast majority,
[03:25:41.720 --> 03:25:42.680]   unless there's a big crunch,
[03:25:42.680 --> 03:25:44.800]   which apparently doesn't seem likely.
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:46.040]   Like most of the universe,
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:47.880]   there's this blink of an eye that's happening right now
[03:25:47.880 --> 03:25:51.080]   that life is even possible, like the era of stars.
[03:25:51.080 --> 03:25:53.480]   So it's like, we're gonna fade out at some point.
[03:25:53.480 --> 03:25:58.120]   And then we get at this level of consciousness,
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:00.640]   and like, okay, maybe there is life after death,
[03:26:00.640 --> 03:26:02.240]   maybe there's maybe times in illusion,
[03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:04.920]   maybe we're gonna, like, that part I'm ready for.
[03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:07.600]   Like, I'm like, you know, like,
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:09.160]   that would be really great, and I'm looking,
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:10.320]   I'm not afraid of that at all.
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:12.680]   It's like, even if it's just strange,
[03:26:12.680 --> 03:26:15.400]   like if I could push a button to enter that door,
[03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:16.880]   I mean, I'm not gonna, you know, die,
[03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:17.920]   you know, I'm not gonna kill myself,
[03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:19.880]   but it's like, if I could take a peek
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:21.920]   at what that reality is, or choose,
[03:26:21.920 --> 03:26:23.320]   at the end of my life, if I could choose
[03:26:23.320 --> 03:26:27.040]   of entering into a universe where there is an afterlife
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:28.320]   of something completely unknown
[03:26:28.320 --> 03:26:29.480]   versus one where there's none,
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:32.200]   I think I'd say, well, let's see what's behind that.
[03:26:32.200 --> 03:26:33.980]   - That's a true scientist way of thinking.
[03:26:33.980 --> 03:26:36.840]   If there's a door, you're excited about opening it
[03:26:36.840 --> 03:26:38.120]   and going in.
[03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:41.080]   - Right, but I am attracted to this idea, like,
[03:26:41.080 --> 03:26:45.200]   you know, and I recognize it's easier said than done
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:47.400]   to say I'm okay with not existing.
[03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:48.240]   - Yeah.
[03:26:48.240 --> 03:26:49.060]   - It's like the real test is like,
[03:26:49.060 --> 03:26:50.520]   okay, check me on my deathbed.
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:52.560]   You know, it's like, it's, oh, I'll be all right,
[03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:55.360]   it's a beautiful thing, and the humility of surrendering,
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:59.080]   and I really hope, and I think I'd probably be more likely
[03:26:59.080 --> 03:27:01.480]   to be in that realm right now than I would,
[03:27:01.480 --> 03:27:05.320]   like, or check me when I get a terminal cancer diagnosis,
[03:27:05.320 --> 03:27:06.920]   and I really hope I'm more in that realm,
[03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:10.080]   but I know enough about human nature
[03:27:10.080 --> 03:27:11.400]   to know that, like, I don't wanna,
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:12.680]   I can't really speak to that,
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:14.680]   'cause I haven't been in that situation.
[03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:16.960]   And I think there can be a beauty to that,
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:19.600]   and the transcendence of like, yeah,
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:22.000]   and you know, it was beautiful,
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:25.040]   not just despite all that, but because of that,
[03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:27.240]   because ultimately there's gonna be nothing,
[03:27:27.240 --> 03:27:29.000]   and because we came from nothing,
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:30.280]   and we dealt with all this shit,
[03:27:30.280 --> 03:27:31.640]   the fact that there was still beauty,
[03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:33.760]   and truth, and connection, like,
[03:27:33.760 --> 03:27:39.000]   that, you know, like, it just, it's a beautiful thing,
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:43.520]   but I hope I'm in that, it's easy to say that now, like,
[03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:44.360]   yeah.
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:47.520]   - Do you think there's a meaning to this thing
[03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:52.520]   we got going on, life, existence, on Earth,
[03:27:52.520 --> 03:27:58.080]   to us individuals, from a psychedelics researcher perspective
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:00.680]   or from just a human perspective?
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:03.160]   - Those merge together for me,
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:04.320]   because it's just hard,
[03:28:04.320 --> 03:28:07.200]   I've been doing this research for almost 17 years,
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:09.600]   and like, not just the cancer study,
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:11.560]   but so many times people, like,
[03:28:12.840 --> 03:28:16.040]   I remember a session in one of our studies,
[03:28:16.040 --> 03:28:18.280]   someone who wasn't getting any treatment for anything,
[03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:19.660]   but one of our healthy normal studies,
[03:28:19.660 --> 03:28:23.520]   where he was contemplating the suicide of his son,
[03:28:23.520 --> 03:28:25.840]   and just these, I mean,
[03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:28.740]   just like the most intense human experiences
[03:28:28.740 --> 03:28:32.600]   that you can have in the most vulnerable situations,
[03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:35.880]   sometimes, like, people, like, you know,
[03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:38.500]   and it's just like, you have to have a,
[03:28:38.500 --> 03:28:40.720]   and you just feel lucky to be part of that process,
[03:28:40.720 --> 03:28:44.040]   that people trust you to let their guards down like that.
[03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:47.640]   Like, I don't know, the meaning,
[03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:52.640]   I think the meaning of life is defined meaning,
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:54.880]   and I think, actually, I think I just described it
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:28:58.040]   a minute ago, it's like that transcendence of everything,
[03:28:58.040 --> 03:29:02.560]   like, it's the beauty despite the absolute ugliness,
[03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:06.100]   it's the, and as a species,
[03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:07.520]   and I think more about this,
[03:29:07.520 --> 03:29:08.880]   like, I think about this a lot,
[03:29:08.880 --> 03:29:13.880]   it's the fact that we are, I mean, we're,
[03:29:13.880 --> 03:29:18.800]   we come from filth, I mean, we're, you know, we're animals,
[03:29:18.800 --> 03:29:21.440]   we come from, like, we're all descendant
[03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:24.720]   from murderers and rapists, like, we,
[03:29:24.720 --> 03:29:29.520]   despite that background, we are capable
[03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:33.800]   of this self-sacrifice, and the connection,
[03:29:33.800 --> 03:29:36.640]   and figuring things out, you know,
[03:29:36.640 --> 03:29:40.240]   truth science and other forms of truth, you know, seeking,
[03:29:40.240 --> 03:29:44.120]   and an artwork, just the beauty of music
[03:29:44.120 --> 03:29:46.360]   and other forms of art, it's like,
[03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:51.360]   the fact that that's possible is the meaning of life, I mean.
[03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:54.520]   - And ultimately, that feels to be creating
[03:29:54.520 --> 03:29:57.360]   more and richer experiences,
[03:29:57.360 --> 03:30:02.360]   from a Russian perspective, both the dark,
[03:30:03.400 --> 03:30:05.400]   you mentioned the cancer diagnosis,
[03:30:05.400 --> 03:30:07.960]   or losing a child to suicide,
[03:30:07.960 --> 03:30:12.960]   or all those dark things is still rich experiences,
[03:30:12.960 --> 03:30:16.880]   and also the beautiful creations,
[03:30:16.880 --> 03:30:19.000]   the art, the music, the science,
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:20.280]   that's also rich experience,
[03:30:20.280 --> 03:30:22.680]   so somehow we're figuring out,
[03:30:22.680 --> 03:30:25.000]   from just like psychedelics expand our mind
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:26.480]   to the possibility of experiences,
[03:30:26.480 --> 03:30:29.440]   somehow we're able to figure out different ways
[03:30:29.440 --> 03:30:33.080]   as a society to expand the realm of experiences,
[03:30:33.080 --> 03:30:35.000]   and from that we gain meaning somehow.
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:36.720]   - Right, and that's part of like this,
[03:30:36.720 --> 03:30:38.040]   we're going across different levels here,
[03:30:38.040 --> 03:30:40.960]   but like the idea that so-called bad trips
[03:30:40.960 --> 03:30:42.800]   or challenging experiences are so common
[03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:44.600]   in psychedelic experiences, it's like,
[03:30:44.600 --> 03:30:47.680]   that's a part of that, like, yeah, it's tough,
[03:30:47.680 --> 03:30:49.480]   and most of the important things in life
[03:30:49.480 --> 03:30:51.800]   are really, really tough and scary,
[03:30:51.800 --> 03:30:54.480]   and most of the things like the death of a loved one,
[03:30:54.480 --> 03:30:57.680]   like the greatest learning experiences,
[03:30:57.680 --> 03:31:01.120]   the things that make you who you are, are the horrors,
[03:31:01.120 --> 03:31:03.280]   and it's like, yeah, we try to minimize them,
[03:31:03.280 --> 03:31:06.720]   we try to avoid them, but, and I don't know,
[03:31:06.720 --> 03:31:08.040]   I think we all need to get into the mode
[03:31:08.040 --> 03:31:09.240]   of like giving ourselves a break,
[03:31:09.240 --> 03:31:12.800]   both personally and societally.
[03:31:12.800 --> 03:31:14.520]   I mean, I went through like the,
[03:31:14.520 --> 03:31:16.560]   I think a lot of people do these days in my 20s,
[03:31:16.560 --> 03:31:19.520]   like, oh, the humans are just,
[03:31:19.520 --> 03:31:21.560]   they're kind of a disease on the planet,
[03:31:21.560 --> 03:31:23.760]   and like, and then in terms of our country,
[03:31:23.760 --> 03:31:25.040]   in terms of the United States, it's like,
[03:31:25.040 --> 03:31:28.360]   oh, we have all these horrible sins in our past,
[03:31:28.360 --> 03:31:29.560]   and it's like, I think about that,
[03:31:29.560 --> 03:31:34.560]   like the, I think about it, like my three-year-old,
[03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:36.880]   it's like, yeah, you can construct a story
[03:31:36.880 --> 03:31:39.000]   where this is all just horrible,
[03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:42.440]   you can look at that stuff and say, this is all just horror,
[03:31:42.440 --> 03:31:44.000]   you know, we're, you are, like,
[03:31:44.000 --> 03:31:46.200]   there's no logical answer to our, you know,
[03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:48.640]   rational answer to say we're not a disease on the planet,
[03:31:48.640 --> 03:31:52.480]   from one lens, we are, you know, you know,
[03:31:52.480 --> 03:31:57.080]   and like, there's, you could just look at humanity as that,
[03:31:57.080 --> 03:31:58.200]   like nothing but this horrible thing,
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:00.720]   you can look at any, and you name the system,
[03:32:00.720 --> 03:32:03.840]   you know, modern medicine, Western medicine,
[03:32:03.840 --> 03:32:05.680]   you know, the university system,
[03:32:05.680 --> 03:32:07.000]   and it's like, you could dismiss everything,
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:08.480]   it's a, you know, big pharma,
[03:32:08.480 --> 03:32:09.960]   like, hopefully these vaccines work,
[03:32:09.960 --> 03:32:11.680]   and then like, okay, I'd like to, you know,
[03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:14.680]   like, I'm kind of glad big pharma was a part of that,
[03:32:14.680 --> 03:32:17.720]   like, you know, and it's like the United States,
[03:32:17.720 --> 03:32:19.600]   you can like point to the horrors,
[03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:22.640]   like any other country that's been around a long time
[03:32:22.640 --> 03:32:24.200]   that has these legitimate horrors,
[03:32:24.200 --> 03:32:27.760]   and kind of dismiss, like, these beautiful things,
[03:32:27.760 --> 03:32:30.160]   like, yeah, we have this like modifiable
[03:32:30.160 --> 03:32:32.540]   constitutional republic that just,
[03:32:32.540 --> 03:32:36.880]   like, I still think is the best thing going, you know,
[03:32:36.880 --> 03:32:39.920]   that as a model system of like how humans
[03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:41.440]   have to figure out how to work together,
[03:32:41.440 --> 03:32:45.440]   it's like it's, how, there's no better system
[03:32:45.440 --> 03:32:47.280]   that I've come across.
[03:32:47.280 --> 03:32:50.160]   - Yeah, there's, if we're willing to look for it,
[03:32:50.160 --> 03:32:53.340]   there's a beautiful court to a lot of things we've created.
[03:32:53.340 --> 03:32:57.080]   Yeah, this country is a great example of that,
[03:32:57.080 --> 03:33:00.720]   but most of the human experience has a beauty to it,
[03:33:00.720 --> 03:33:02.200]   even the suffering.
[03:33:02.200 --> 03:33:05.720]   - Right, so the meaning is choosing to focus
[03:33:05.720 --> 03:33:07.560]   on that positivity and not forget it.
[03:33:07.560 --> 03:33:08.760]   - Beautifully put.
[03:33:08.760 --> 03:33:12.400]   Speaking of experiences, this was one of my favorite

[03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:10.840]   from Terrence McKenna.
[03:34:10.840 --> 03:34:12.960]   "Nature loves courage.
[03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:15.240]   "You make the commitment, and nature will respond
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:18.720]   "to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.
[03:34:18.720 --> 03:34:20.760]   "Dream the impossible dream,
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:23.320]   "and the world will not grind you under.
[03:34:23.320 --> 03:34:24.880]   "It will lift you up.
[03:34:24.880 --> 03:34:26.220]   "This is the trick.
[03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:28.680]   "This is what all these teachers and philosophers
[03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:32.700]   "who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,
[03:34:32.700 --> 03:34:34.800]   "this is what they understood.
[03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:37.960]   "This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.
[03:34:37.960 --> 03:34:40.040]   "This is how magic is done,
[03:34:40.040 --> 03:34:42.560]   "by hurling yourself into the abyss
[03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:45.040]   "and discovering it's a feather bed."
[03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:48.880]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
