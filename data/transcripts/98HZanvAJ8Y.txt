[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   The following is a conversation with Brian Greene,
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.900]   theoretical physicist at Columbia
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.120]   and author of many amazing books on physics,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.480]   including his latest, "Until the End of Time,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.440]   Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.880]   in an Evolving Universe."
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.180]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.420]   in the description.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.240]   And now, here's my conversation with Brian Greene.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.960]   In your most recent book, "Until the End of Time,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.640]   you quote Bertrand Russell from a debate he had
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.920]   about God in 1948.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.560]   He says, quote, "So far as scientific evidence goes,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.440]   the universe has crawled by slow stages
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.720]   to a somewhat pitiful result on this earth
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.920]   and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   to a condition of universal death.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.080]   If this is to be taken as evidence of purpose,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.780]   I can only say that the purpose is one
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.640]   that does not appeal to me.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360]   I see no reason, therefore, to believe in any sort of God."
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.080]   That's quite a depressing statement.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   As you say, this is a bleak outlook on our universe
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.400]   and the emergence of human consciousness.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.920]   So let me ask, what is the more hopeful perspective
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.220]   to take on this story?
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.900]   - Well, I think the more hopeful perspective
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.440]   is to more fully understand
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   what was driving Bertrand Russell to this perspective.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.680]   And then to see it within a broader context.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.720]   And really that's in some sense
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.480]   what my book "Until the End of Time" is all about.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.720]   But in brief, I would say that there's a lot of truth
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.700]   to what Bertrand Russell was saying there.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700]   When you look at the second law of thermodynamics,
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.160]   which is the underlying scientific idea
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.040]   that's driving this notion
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.500]   that everything's gonna wither, decay, fall apart.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.120]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.800]   Second law of thermodynamics establishes that disorder,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.640]   entropy, in aggregate, is always on the rise.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.960]   And that is indeed interpretable
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.620]   as disintegration and destruction
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.560]   over sufficiently long timescales.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.480]   But my view is, when you recognize
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.960]   how special that makes us,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.560]   that we are these exquisitely ordered configurations
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.080]   of particles that only will last for a blink of an eye
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   in cosmological time-like terms,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   the fact that we're here and we can do what we do,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.920]   to me, that's just really something
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.160]   that inspires gratitude and wonder
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.020]   and a sense of deep purpose
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.080]   by virtue of being these unique collections of entities
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.640]   that happen to rise up, look around,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.480]   and try to figure out where we are
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.520]   and what the heck we should do with our time.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.740]   So it's not that I would disagree with Bertrand Russell
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.740]   in terms of the basic physics and the basic unfolding,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.560]   but I think it's really a matter of the slant
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.840]   that you take on what it means for us.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.680]   - So maybe we'll skip around a bit,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.860]   but let me ask the biggest possible question,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.260]   then you said purpose.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.520]   So what's the meaning of it all then?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   Is there a meaning to life that we can take from this,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.180]   from this brief emergence of complexity
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.260]   that arises from simple things
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.860]   and then goes into a heat death
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.780]   that is once again returns to simple things
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.060]   as the march of the second law of thermodynamics goes on?
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.880]   - I think there is,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.640]   but I don't think it's a universal answer.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.340]   And so I think throughout the ages,
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.340]   there has been a kind of quest for some final way
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.660]   of articulating meaning and purpose,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.540]   whether it's God, whether it's love,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.660]   whether it's companionship.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.700]   I mean, many people put forward different ways
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.660]   of taking this question on,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.340]   and there is no one right answer
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.340]   when you recognize deeply that the universe doesn't care.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900]   There is nothing out there that is the final answer.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   It's not as though we need a more powerful telescope
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.940]   and somehow if we can look deeply into the universe,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.300]   all will become clear.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.980]   In fact, the deeper we've looked,
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.440]   both literally and metaphorically,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.860]   into the universe and into the structure of reality,
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.020]   the more it's become clear
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.020]   that we are just a momentary byproduct of laws of physics
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.220]   that don't have any emotional content.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.660]   They don't have any intrinsic sense of meaning or purpose.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.340]   And when you recognize that,
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.860]   you realize that searching for the universal
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.700]   for this kind of a question is a fool's errand.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.260]   Every individual has the capacity
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.700]   to make their own meaning, to set their own purpose.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.780]   And that's not some platitude.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.860]   That is what we are.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.780]   Because there is no fundamental answer.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.120]   It's what you make of it.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.200]   And however much that may sound like a hallmark card,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.740]   this really is the deep lesson of physics
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.420]   and science more generally over the past few hundred years.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.700]   - But there's some level where you can objectively say
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.060]   that whatever we got going on here is kind of peculiar.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.060]   It's kind of special in terms of complexity.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.580]   And maybe you can even begin to measure it
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.900]   and like come up with metrics
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.560]   where whatever we got going on on Earth,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.620]   these like interesting hierarchical complexities
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.340]   that form more and more sophisticated biological system,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.800]   that seems kind of unique
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.540]   when you look at the entirety of the universe.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.540]   The observable part that we can see with our tools.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.660]   I mean, so I have to ask,
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.880]   as you describe in your book once again,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.220]   Schrodinger wrote the book, "What is Life?"
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.220]   based on a few lectures he gave in 1944.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.740]   So let me ask the fundamental question here.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.580]   What is life?
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.840]   This particular thing we got going on here,
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.300]   this pocket of complexity
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.220]   that emerged from such simple things.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.660]   - Yeah, it's a tough question.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.620]   I asked that question even to Richard Dawkins once,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.380]   and I already have my preconceived notion,
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.060]   which he pretty much confirmed,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.940]   which is if one could give an answer to that question
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.100]   that allowed you to sort of draw a line in the sand
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.680]   between the not living and the living,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.020]   then perhaps we would have the insight that we yearn for
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.460]   in trying to say what is so special about life.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.260]   But the fact of the matter is it's a continuum.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.180]   There's a continuum from the things
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.100]   that we would typically call non-living and animate
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.660]   to the things that we obviously call animate
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.780]   and full of the currents of life.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   Somewhere in there,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.500]   it is a question of the complexity of the structure,
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.320]   the ability of the structure to take in raw material
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.020]   from the environment and process it through a metabolism
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.260]   that allows the structure to extract energy
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.980]   and to release entropy to the wider environment.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.100]   Somewhere in those collections of biological processes
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.540]   is the necessity or the necessary ingredients
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.580]   and processes for life,
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.620]   but drawing that line in the sand
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.540]   is not something that we're able to do.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.500]   But I would agree with you.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.020]   It's deeply peculiar.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.000]   It may, in fact, be unique, but it may not.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.260]   It could be that the universe is such
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.020]   that under fairly typical conditions,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.020]   a star that's a well-ordered source of low entropy energy,
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.120]   that's what the sun is,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.020]   together with the planet being bathed
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.700]   by that low entropy energy,
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.740]   together with a surface that has enough
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.300]   of the raw constituents that we recognize
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.140]   are fairly commonplace result of supernova explosions
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.980]   where a star spews forth the result of the nuclear furnace
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.260]   that is the core of a star.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.700]   It could be that all you need
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.040]   are those fairly commonplace conditions
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   and maybe life naturally forms.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.460]   Look, the James Webb Space Telescope
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.780]   is going up, hopefully, in December.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.760]   And one of the goals of that mission
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.660]   is to look at atmospheres around distant planets
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.460]   and perhaps come to some sense of how special
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.000]   or not life, or at least life as we know it,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.980]   is in the universe.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.060]   - Which part of the story of life,
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.700]   let's stick to Earth for a second,
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.760]   do you think is the hardest?
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.740]   If you were like a betting man,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.440]   which part is the hardest to make happen?
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.180]   Is it the origin of life?
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.500]   Again, we haven't drawn the line of where,
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.920]   as you say, the line between a rock and a rabbit.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.180]   That part, is it complex organisms
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.260]   like multicellular organisms?
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.980]   Is it crawling out of the ocean
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.380]   where the fish somehow figured out how to crawl around?
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.960]   Is it then the us homo sapiens,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.460]   as we like to think of ourselves, special and intelligent?
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.260]   Or is it somewhere in between, as you also talk about,
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.500]   again, very hard to know
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   at which point does consciousness emerge?
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.940]   If you were to sort of took a survey
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.220]   and made bets about other Earth-like planets
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.380]   in the universe,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.660]   where do you think they get stuck the most?
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.500]   - Well, I would certainly say,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.380]   if we're gonna go all the way
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.420]   to conscious beings like ourselves,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.180]   I would put it at the onset of consciousness,
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.620]   which again, I think is a continuum.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.120]   I don't think it is something
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.660]   that you can draw the line in the sand,
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.980]   but there are obvious circumstances,
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.020]   there are obvious creatures such as ourselves,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.540]   where we do recognize a certain kind
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.820]   of self-reflective conscious awareness.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.660]   And if we think about what it would require
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.660]   for a system of living beings to acquire consciousness,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.580]   I think that's probably the hardest part,
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.740]   because look, take Earth and recognize
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.460]   that it weren't for some singular event,
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.980]   65 million years ago,
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.340]   where this large rock slams into planet Earth
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.860]   and wipes out the dinosaurs,
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.380]   maybe the dinosaurs would still rule the planet
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.580]   and they may well have not developed
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.900]   the kind of conscious awareness that we have.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.580]   So for billions of years on this planet,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.140]   there was life that didn't have
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.180]   the kind of conscious awareness that we have.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.180]   And it was an accidental event in astrophysical history
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.140]   that allowed a mammalian species like us
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.260]   to ultimately be the end product.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.980]   And so, yeah, I could imagine there's a lot of life
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.780]   out there, but perhaps none of it's wondering
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.620]   what's the meaning of life or trying to make sense of it,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.260]   just going about its business of survival,
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.620]   which of course is the dominant activity
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.620]   that life on this planet has practiced.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.900]   We are a rare exception to that.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.020]   - And I really appreciate that you lean into
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.500]   some of these unanswerable questions with me today.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.420]   But so you think about consciousness
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.420]   not as like a phase shift, the binary zero one.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.580]   You think of it as a continuum,
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.700]   that humans somehow are maybe some
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.020]   of the most conscious beings on Earth.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.820]   - I mean, people will dispute that.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.660]   - Yes, I mean, well--
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.660]   - And it's a very hard argument to make.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.900]   - People will dispute that.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.220]   - Rocks probably will stay quiet on the matter.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.820]   - Maybe not, right?
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.620]   For the moment, they're waiting for their opportunity.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.620]   But I agree that, look, even when you and I
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.660]   look at each other, I am not fully convinced
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.580]   that you're a conscious being, right?
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.420]   I mean, I think that you are.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.340]   - It's not to me.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.340]   - I mean, your behavior is such that
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.380]   that's the best explanation for what's going on.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.480]   But of course, we're all in the position
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   of only having direct awareness of our own conscious being.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.860]   And therefore, when it comes to other creatures in the world,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.740]   we're in a similar state of ignorance
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.280]   regarding what's actually happening
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.560]   inside of their head, if they have a head.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.360]   And so it's hard to know how singular we are.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.320]   But I would say, based on the best available data
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.960]   and the best explanations that we can make,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.600]   yeah, there is something special about us.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.520]   I don't think that there are fish walking around
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.240]   and coming up with existentialism.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   I don't know that there are dogs walking around
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.280]   who've developed an understanding
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.640]   of the general theory of relativity.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.840]   I mean, maybe we're wrong,
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.740]   but that seems the best explanation.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.720]   - What do you think is more special,
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.960]   intelligence or consciousness?
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.320]   - I think consciousness.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   And I think that there's a deep connection
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.600]   between these ideas.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.000]   They are distinct, but they're deeply connected.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.120]   But look, I mean, to me and to, of course,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.320]   many philosophers actually coined a name for this,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.920]   the hard problem of consciousness,
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.480]   you know, David Chalmers and others.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.780]   As a physicist, I look at the world
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.780]   and I see it's particles governed by physical law.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.440]   We can name them.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.800]   You know, we got electrons, we got quarks
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.920]   that come in various flavors and so forth.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.480]   We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.840]   And we have a list of laws
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.320]   that seemingly govern those ingredients.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   And nowhere in there is there even a hint
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.720]   that when you put those particles together in the right way,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.280]   an inner world should turn on.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.080]   And it's not only that there's no hint, it's insane.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.720]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.680]   How could it be that a thoughtless,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.180]   passionless, emotionless particle,
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.200]   when grouped together with compatriots,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.280]   somehow can yield something so deeply foreign
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.380]   to the nature of the ingredients themselves?
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.900]   So answering that question,
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.920]   I think is among the deepest
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   and most difficult questions that we face.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   - Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.120]   Or is it possible, I think you mentioned in your book
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.080]   that it's just like almost like a side effect.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.000]   It's an emergent thing that's like,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.200]   oh, it's nice.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.920]   It's like a nice little feature.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.600]   - Yeah, well, I mean, when people use the phrase
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.760]   hard problem, I mean,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.800]   they mean in a somewhat technical sense
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.760]   that it's trying to explain something
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.640]   that seems fundamentally unavailable
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.640]   to third party objective analysis, right?
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.640]   I'm the only one that can get inside my head.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.720]   And I can tell you a lot about what's happening
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.360]   inside my head right now is reflected in what I'm saying.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.160]   And you can try to deduce things
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.520]   about what's going on inside my head,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.240]   but you don't have access to it in the way that I do.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.080]   And so it seems like a fundamentally different
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.360]   kind of problem from the ones that we have
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.760]   successfully dealt with over the course of centuries
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.880]   in science where we look at the motion of the moon,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.280]   everybody can look, everybody can measure it.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.900]   We look at the properties of hydrogen,
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.640]   when you shine lasers on,
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.840]   everybody can look at the data and understand it.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.960]   And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.360]   And in that sense, it seems like it is hard
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.640]   relative to the others.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.680]   But I do think ultimately that the explanation will be,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.160]   as you recount, I think that 100 years from now,
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.200]   or maybe it's a thousand,
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.520]   it's hard to predict the timescale for developments,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.440]   but I think we'll get to a place where we'll look back
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.320]   and kind of smile at those folks in the 20th century
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.360]   and before 21st century and before
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.320]   who thought consciousness was so incredibly mysterious
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.400]   when the reality of it is, eh,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.800]   it's just a thing that happens when particles come together.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.420]   And however mysterious that feels right now,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.260]   I think, for instance,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.680]   when we start to build conscious systems,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.000]   things that you're more familiar with than I am,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.440]   when we start to build these artificial systems
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.180]   and those systems report to us,
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.320]   I'm feeling sad, I'm feeling anxious.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.680]   Yeah, there's a world going on inside here.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.640]   I think the mystery of consciousness
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.880]   will just begin to evaporate.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.480]   - Well, first of all, beautifully put,
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.280]   and I agree with you completely,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.520]   just the way you said it, it'll begin to evaporate.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.280]   I have built quite a few robots
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   and have had them do emotional type things.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.420]   And it's immediate that exactly what you're saying,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.640]   this kind of mystery of consciousness starts to evaporate,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   that the kind of need to truly understand,
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.400]   to solve the hard problem of consciousness disappears,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.880]   because, well, I don't really care
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.680]   if I understand or can solve
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.360]   the hard problem of consciousness.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.560]   That thing sure as heck looks conscious.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.880]   You know, I feel like that way when I interact with a dog.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.440]   I don't need to solve the problem of consciousness
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   to be able to interact and richly enjoy the experience
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.400]   with this other living being.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.440]   Obviously, same thing with other humans.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.960]   I don't need to fully understand it.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.000]   And there's some aspect,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.140]   maybe this is a little bit too engineering focused,
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.920]   but there's some aspect in which
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.800]   it feels like consciousness is just a nice trick
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.760]   to help us communicate with each other.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.680]   It sounds ridiculous to say,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   but sort of the ability to experience the world
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   is very useful in a subjective sense,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.200]   is very useful to put yourself in that world
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.360]   and to be able to describe the experience to others.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.840]   It could be just a social and the emerge.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.500]   Obviously, animals, the sort of more primitive animals
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.760]   might experience consciousness in some more primitive way,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.280]   but this kind of rich subjective experience
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.720]   that we think about as humans,
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.440]   I think it's probably deeply coupled
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.840]   like language and poetry.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.720]   - Yeah, that resonates with my view as well.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.280]   I mean, there's a scientist,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.400]   maybe you've spoken to him,
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.200]   Michael Graziano from Princeton.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.640]   Yeah, he's developed ideas of consciousness that,
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.660]   look, I don't think they solve the problem,
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.400]   but I think they do illuminate it in an interesting way
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.040]   where basically we are not aware
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.120]   of all the underlying physiochemical processes
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.960]   that make our brains and our inner worlds
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.040]   tick the way they do.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.240]   And because of that dissociation between sensation
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.120]   and the physics of it and the chemistry of it
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.600]   and the biology of it,
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   it feels like our minds and our inner worlds
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.960]   are just untethered,
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.640]   like floating somewhere in this gray matter
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.500]   inside of our heads.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.600]   And the way I like to think of it is like,
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   look, if you're in a dark room, right?
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.360]   And I had glow-in-the-dark paint on my fingers.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   So all you saw was my fingers dancing around.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.000]   There'd be something mysterious.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.440]   How could those fingers be doing that?
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.280]   And then you turn on the light,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.720]   you realize, oh, there's this arm underlying it.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.800]   And that's the deep physical connection explains it all.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.640]   And I think that's what we're missing,
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.340]   the deep physical connection
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.440]   between what's happening up here
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.560]   and what is responsible for it
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.440]   in a physical, chemical, biological way.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.640]   And so to me, that at least gives me some understanding
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.760]   of why consciousness feels so mysterious,
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.600]   because we are suppressing all of the underlying science
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.560]   that ultimately is responsible for it.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.960]   And one day we will reveal that more fully.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.280]   And I think that will help us tether this experience
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.600]   to something quite tangible in the world.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.400]   - I wonder if the mystery
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.160]   is an important component of enjoying something.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.200]   So once we know how this thing works,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   maybe we will no longer enjoy this conversation.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.280]   We'll seek other sources of enjoyment.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.360]   But this is, again, from an engineering perspective.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   I wonder if the mystery is an important component.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.560]   - Well, have you ever seen,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.560]   there's this beautiful interview that Richard Feynman did,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.040]   great Nobel Laureate physicist
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.720]   responsible for a lot of our understanding
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.080]   of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and so forth.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.520]   And he was in a conversation with an interviewer
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.760]   where he noted that some people feel like
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.400]   once the mystery is gone, once science explains something,
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.280]   the beauty goes away, the wonder of it goes away.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.040]   And he was emphasizing in his response to that,
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.000]   he's like, "No, that's not the right way of thinking about it."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.680]   He says, "Look, when I look at a rose,"
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.440]   he says, "Yeah, I can still deeply enjoy the aroma,
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.880]   "the color, the texture."
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.820]   He says, "But what I can do that you can't
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.640]   "if you're not a physicist, I can look more deeply
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.260]   "and understand where the red comes from,
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.420]   "where the aroma comes from,
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.720]   "where the structure comes from."
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   He says, "That only augments my wonder.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.820]   "It only augments my experience.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.600]   "It doesn't flatten it or take away from it."
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.440]   So I sort of-- - I hope he's right.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.920]   - Yeah, well, I sort of take that as a bit of a motto
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.620]   in some sense that there is a wonder
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.840]   that comes from a kind of ignorance.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.720]   And I don't mean that in a derogatory sense,
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.280]   but just from not knowing.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.720]   So there is a wonder that comes from mystery.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.480]   There's another kind of wonder that comes from knowing
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.840]   and deep knowing.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   And I think that kind of wonder has its own special character
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.140]   that in some ways can be more gratifying.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.060]   - I hope he's right.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.460]   I hope you're right.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.300]   But there's also, I remember he said something
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.940]   about like science is an onion or something like that.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.540]   You can peel back, you keep peeling back.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.600]   I mean, there is also, when you understand something,
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.060]   there's always a sense that there's more mystery
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.380]   to understand.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.060]   Like you never get to the bottom of the mystery.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.940]   - But I think it's also different than,
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.660]   I don't think you can analogize say to a magician, right?
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.260]   A magician does some trick, you learn how it sounds like,
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.580]   oh my God, that's ridiculous when you find.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.820]   But nature is perhaps the best magician
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.100]   if you wanna try to make the analogy there
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.900]   because when you peel things back and you understand
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.260]   how it is that things have color and you have electrons
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.460]   dancing from one orbital to another,
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.260]   emitting photons at very particular wavelengths
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.940]   that are described by these beautiful equations
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.500]   of quantum electrodynamics,
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.140]   part of which that Feynman developed,
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.500]   it gives you a greater sense of awe
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.740]   when the curtain is pulled back
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.380]   than what happens in other circumstances
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.420]   where it does flatten it completely.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.580]   - Yeah, it's very possible then, say in physics,
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.420]   that we arrive at a theory of everything
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.500]   that unifies the laws of physics
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.020]   and has a very strong understanding
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.580]   of the fabric of reality.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.420]   Even like from the big bang to today,
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.020]   it's possible that that understanding
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.540]   is only going to elevate our appreciation
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.380]   of this whole thing.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.300]   - Yeah, I think it will.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.140]   I think it will.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.020]   I mean, I think it has so far.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.420]   But the other side of it which you emphasize
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   is it's not like science somehow reaches an end, right?
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.460]   There are certain categories of questions
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.060]   that do reach an end.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.100]   I think we one day will close the book
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.140]   on nature's ingredients and the fundamental laws.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.660]   Now that, we can't prove that.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.380]   Maybe it goes on forever, smaller and smaller.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.860]   Maybe there are deeper and deeper laws.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.820]   But I don't think so.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.500]   I think that there's going to be a collection of ingredients
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.340]   and a collection of basic laws.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.300]   That chapter will close.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.660]   But it's one chapter.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.900]   Now we take that knowledge and we try to understand
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.780]   how the world builds the structures that it does,
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.420]   from planets to people to black holes
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.660]   to the possibility of other universes.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.740]   And every step of the way,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.900]   the collection of questions that we don't know the answer to
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.340]   only blossoms.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.800]   And so there's a deep sense of gratification
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.060]   from understanding certain qualities of the world.
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.540]   But I would say that if you take a ratio
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.800]   of what we understand to the things that we know
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.720]   that we don't yet understand,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.060]   that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.180]   because the things that we know that we don't understand
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.380]   grows larger and larger.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.700]   - Do you have a hope that we solve that
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.220]   theory of everything puzzle in the next few decades?
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.860]   So there's been a bunch of attempts from string theory
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.540]   to all kinds of attempts at trying to solve quantum gravity
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.300]   or basically come up with a theory for quantum gravity.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   There's a lot of complexities to this.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   One, for experimental validation,
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.860]   you have to observe effects
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.460]   that are very difficult to measure.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.700]   So you have to build, that's like an engineering challenge.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.300]   And then there's the theory challenge,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.420]   which is like, it seems very difficult
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.860]   to connect the laws of gravity to quantum mechanics.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.520]   Do you have a hope or are we hopelessly stuck?
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.660]   - Well, I have to have a hope.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.660]   I mean, it's in some sense,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.340]   but I devote at least part of my professional life
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.080]   toward trying to make progress on,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.580]   I'm glad you used the phrase quantum gravity.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.340]   I'm not a great fan of the theory of everything phrase
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.340]   because it does make other scientists feel like
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.660]   if they're not working on this, what are they working on?
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.500]   Man's like, you know, there's not much left
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.860]   when you're talking about theory of everything.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.260]   - Biology is just small details.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.500]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.220]   Yeah, so it is really trying to put gravity
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.180]   and quantum mechanics together.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.600]   And since I was a college kid,
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.980]   I was deeply fascinated with gravity.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.500]   And as I learned quantum mechanics,
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.020]   the notion of physicists being stumped
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.580]   and trying to blend them together,
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.900]   how could one not get fired up about
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.940]   maybe contributing something to that journey?
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.660]   And so we've been on this, you know,
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.820]   I've been on this for 30 years since I was a student.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.820]   We have made progress.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.860]   We do have ideas.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.240]   You mentioned string theory is one possible scenario.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.540]   It's not stuck.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.900]   String theory is a vibrant field of research
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.620]   that is making incredible progress,
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.320]   but we've not made progress on this issue
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.460]   of experimental verification, validation,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.940]   which is, you know, it is a vital part of the story.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.740]   So I would have hoped that by now
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.620]   we would have made contact with observation.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.620]   If you would have interviewed me back in the '80s
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.940]   when I was, you know, a wild, bright-eyed kid
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.140]   trying to make headway, working 18 hours a day
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.300]   and this sort of stuff, I would have said,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.100]   yeah, by 2021, yeah, we're gonna know
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   whether it's right or wrong.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.600]   We'll have made contact.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.440]   I would have said, look,
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.980]   there may be certain mathematical puzzles
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.180]   that we've yet to work out,
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.880]   but we'll know enough to make contact with experiment.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.540]   That has not happened.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.220]   On the other hand, if you would have interviewed me back then
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.840]   and asked me, will we be able to talk
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.440]   about detailed qualities of black holes
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.940]   and understand them at the level of detail
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.700]   that we actually, I would have said, no,
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.820]   I don't think that we're gonna be able to do that.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.700]   Will we have an exact formulation of string theory
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.980]   in certain circumstances?
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.600]   No, I don't think we're gonna have that, and yet we do.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.940]   So it's just to say you don't know
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.020]   where the progress is going to happen,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.020]   but yes, I do hold out hope that maybe before I move on
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.100]   to wherever, I don't think there is an after,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.780]   but I would love before I leave this earth
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.780]   to know the answer, but science and the universe,
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.420]   it's not about pleasing any individual.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.660]   It is what it is, and so we just press onward
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.000]   and we'll see where it goes.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.100]   - So in terms of string theory,
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.420]   if I just look from an outsider's perspective currently
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.480]   at the theoretical physics community,
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.500]   string theory as a theory has been very popular
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.700]   for a few decades, but it has recently fallen out of favor,
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.900]   or at least there's been like,
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.940]   it became more popular to kind of ask the question,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.340]   is string theory really the answer?
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.860]   Where do you fall on this?
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.180]   Like, how do you make sense of this puzzle?
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.440]   Why do you think it's fallen out of favor?
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.860]   - Yeah, so I would actually challenge the statement
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.260]   that's fallen out of favor.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.220]   I would say that any field of research,
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.700]   when it's new and it's the bright, shiny bicycle
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.020]   that no one has yet seen on that block,
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.020]   yeah, it's going to attract attention
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.060]   and the news outlets are going to cover it
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.180]   and students are going to flock to it, sure,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.180]   but as a field matures, it does shed those qualities
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.260]   because it's no longer as novel as it was
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.340]   when it was first introduced 30, 40 years ago,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.660]   but you need to judge it by a different standard.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.300]   You need to judge it by,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.180]   is it making progress on foundational issues,
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.180]   deepening our understanding of the subject?
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.180]   And by that measure, string theory is scoring very high.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.260]   Now, at the same time, you also need to judge
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.060]   whether it makes contact with experiment
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.860]   as we discussed before too,
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.860]   and in that measure, we're still challenged.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.860]   So I would say that many string theorists, myself included,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.020]   are very sober about the theory.
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.020]   It has the tremendous progress that it had 30, 40 years ago,
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.620]   that hasn't gone away,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.540]   but we've become better equipped
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.420]   at assessing the long journey ahead,
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.260]   and that was something that we weren't particularly good at
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.580]   back, say, in the '80s.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.620]   Look, when I was just starting out in the field,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.820]   there was a sense of physics is about to end.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.700]   String theory is about to be the be-all and end-all,
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.260]   final unified theory,
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.780]   and that will bring this chapter to a close.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.180]   Now, I have to say, I think it was more the younger
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.840]   physicists who were saying that.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.900]   Some of them were seasoned,
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.820]   even if they were pro-string theory at the time.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.700]   I don't know if they were rolling their eyes,
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.780]   but they knew that it was gonna be a long, long journey.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.860]   I think people like John Schwartz,
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.180]   one of the founders of string theory,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.180]   Michael Green, no relation to me, founders of the theory,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.100]   Edward Witten, one of the main people driving the theory
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.900]   back then and today,
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   I think they knew that we were in for a long haul,
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.780]   and that's the nature of science.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.180]   Quick hits that resolve everything, few and far between.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.180]   And so if you were in for the quick solution
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.860]   to the big questions of the world,
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.100]   then you would have been disappointed,
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.820]   and I think there were people who were disappointed
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.740]   and moved on and worked on other subjects.
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.340]   If you're in in the way that Einstein was in
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.900]   for a lifetime of investigation to try to see
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.660]   what the answers to the deep questions would be,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.860]   then I think string theory has been a rich source
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.860]   of material that has kept so many people deeply engaged
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.300]   in moving the frontier forward.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.020]   - There's a few qualities about string theory
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.140]   which are weird.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.940]   I mean, a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.220]   So let me ask the question,
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.140]   what to you is most beautiful about string theory?
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.900]   - Well, what attracted me to the theory at the outset,
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.020]   beyond its putting gravity and quantum mechanics together,
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.980]   which I think is its true claim to fame,
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.780]   at least on paper it's able to do that.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.300]   What attracted me to the theory was the fact
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.180]   that it requires extra dimensions of space.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:16.180]   And this was an idea that intrigued me in a very deep way,
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.620]   even before I really understood what it meant.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.060]   I somehow had, I mean, talk about sort of
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.180]   the emotional part of consciousness and the cognitive part,
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.460]   in some, perhaps you call it strange,
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.940]   in some strange emotional way,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.420]   I was enamored with Einstein's general relativity,
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.740]   the idea of curved space and time,
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.180]   before I really knew what it meant, it just spoke to me.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.260]   I don't know how else to say it.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.620]   And then when I subsequently learned
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.600]   that people had thought about more dimensions of space
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.380]   than we can see and how those extra dimensions
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.060]   would be vital to a deep understanding
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.940]   of the things that we do see in this world,
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.780]   four, five, six dimensions might explain
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.740]   why there are certain forces and particles
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.460]   and how they behave, to me, this was like amazing,
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.180]   utterly amazing, and then when I learned
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.700]   that string theory embraced all these ideas,
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.500]   embraced the general theory of relativity,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.620]   embraced quantum mechanics,
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.320]   embraced the possibility of extra dimensions,
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.140]   then I was hooked.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.460]   And so when I was a graduate student,
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.780]   we would just spend hours,
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.220]   we, I mean a couple of other graduate students and myself
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.260]   who had sort of worked really well together,
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.900]   this was at Oxford in England,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.860]   we would work these enormous numbers of hours a day
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.300]   trying to understand the shapes of these extra dimensions,
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.780]   the geometry of them, what those geometrical shapes
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.420]   for the extra dimensions would imply
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.740]   for things that we see in the world around us,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.660]   and it was a heady, heady time,
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.460]   and that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.980]   over the decades, but I'd say that's really
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.540]   the part of the theory that I think
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.360]   really hooked me most strongly.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.820]   - How are we supposed to think about those extra dimensions?
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.900]   Are we supposed to imagine actual physical reality
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.580]   or is this more in the space of mathematics
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.580]   that allows you to sort of come up with tricks
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.580]   to describe the four-dimensional reality
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.400]   that we more directly perceive?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.660]   - No one really knows the answer, of course,
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.140]   but if I take the most straightforward
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.980]   approach to string theory, you really are imagining
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.780]   that these dimensions are there, they're real.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.560]   I mean, just as you would say that the three space dimensions
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.660]   around us, you know, left, right, back, forth, up, down,
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.900]   yeah, they're real, they're here,
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.340]   we are immersed within those dimensions.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.500]   These other dimensions are as real as these
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.620]   with the one difference being their shape and their size
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.500]   differs from the shape and size of the dimensions
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.660]   that we have direct access to through human experience.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.700]   And one approach imagines that these extra dimensions
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.240]   are tightly coiled up, curled up, crushed together,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.500]   if you will, into a beautiful geometrical form
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.220]   that's all around us, but just too small for us to detect
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.280]   with our eyes, too small for us to detect
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.220]   even with the most powerful equipment that we have.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.940]   Nevertheless, according to the mathematics,
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.580]   the size and the shape of those extra dimensions
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.940]   leaves an imprint in the world that we do have access to.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.980]   So one of the ways that we have hoped yet to achieve
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.840]   to make contact with experimental physics
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.480]   is to see a signature of those extra dimensions
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.620]   in places like the Large Hadron Collider
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.240]   in Geneva, Switzerland.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.420]   And it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't happen,
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.700]   but that would be a stunning moment
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.140]   in the history of the species
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.140]   if data that we acquired in these dimensions
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.420]   gives us kind of incontrovertible evidence
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.860]   that these dimensions are not the only dimensions.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.220]   I mean, how mind-blowing would that be?
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.980]   - So with the Large Hadron Collider,
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.260]   it would be something in the movement of the particles
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.720]   or also the gravitational waves potentially be a place
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.160]   where you can detect signs of multiple dimensions,
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.340]   like with something called LIGO, but much more accurate?
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.580]   - In principle, all of these can work.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.380]   So one of the experiments that we had high hopes for,
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.020]   but by high hopes, I'm actually exaggerating.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.340]   One of the experiments that we imagined
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.540]   might in the best of all circumstances yield some insight.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.100]   We weren't with bated breath waiting for the result.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.580]   We knew it was a long shot.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.660]   When you slam protons together at very high speed
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.940]   at the Large Hadron Collider,
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.540]   if there are these extra dimensions
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.620]   and if they have the right form,
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.140]   and that's a hypothesis that may not be correct,
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.460]   but when the protons collide, they can create debris,
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.900]   energetic debris that can in some sense leave our dimensions
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.740]   and insert itself into the other dimensions.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.340]   And the way you'd recognize that is
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.580]   there'd be more energy before the collision
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.820]   than after the collision
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.420]   because the debris would have taken energy
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.500]   away from the place where our detectors can detect it.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.020]   So that's one real concrete way
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.980]   that you could find evidence for extra dimensions.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.980]   But yeah, since extra dimensions are of space
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.340]   and gravity is something that exists within,
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.740]   in fact is associated with the shape of space,
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.380]   gravitational waves in principle can provide a kind of,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.100]   you know, cat scan of the extra dimensions
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.300]   if you had sufficient control over those processes.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.620]   We don't yet, but perhaps one day we will.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.260]   - Does it make you sad a little bit?
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.020]   There may be looking out into the future,
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.540]   you mentioned Ed Witten,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.620]   that no Nobel prizes have been given yet
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.940]   related to string theory.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.300]   Do you think they will be?
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.620]   Do you think you have to have experimental validation
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.540]   or can a Nobel prize be given?
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.700]   Which I don't think it's been given for quite a long time
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.980]   for a purely sort of theoretical contribution.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.180]   - Yeah, it's certainly as a matter of historical precedent
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.060]   has been the case that those who win the prize
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   have established, investigated, illuminated
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.660]   a demonstrably real quality of the world.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.660]   So gravitational waves,
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.140]   the prize was awarded after they were detected.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:28.860]   Not the mathematics of it, but the actual detection of it.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.740]   You know, the Higgs particle.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.700]   You know, it was an idea that came from the 1960s,
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.280]   Peter Higgs and others, in fact.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   And it wasn't until 2012 on July 4th
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.360]   when the announcement came that this particle
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.720]   had been detected at the Large Hadron Collider
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.200]   that people viewed it as eligible for the Nobel prize.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.760]   The idea was there, the math was there,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.840]   but you needed to confirm it.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.360]   Indeed, the prize ultimately was awarded.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.000]   So I'm not surprised.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.600]   In fact, I would have been surprised
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.200]   if a Nobel prize had been awarded
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.400]   in the arena of string theory
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.200]   because it's far too speculative right now.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.080]   It's far too hypothetical.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.260]   In fact, I am sympathetic to the view
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.920]   that it really shouldn't be called string theory.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.680]   It degrades the word theory
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.920]   because theory in science, of course,
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.780]   means the best available explanation
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.960]   for the things that we observe in the world,
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.840]   the things that we measure in experiments about the world.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.360]   And string theory does not do that, at least not yet.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.680]   So it really should be the string hypothesis, right?
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.560]   We're at an earlier stage of development
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.360]   and that's not the kind of thing
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.640]   that Nobel prizes should be awarded for.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.920]   - What do you think about the critics out there?
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.040]   Peter White, he's from Columbia too, I think,
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.540]   Sabine Haffenstetter.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.400]   Is that a healthy thing or should we sort of focus
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.580]   on sort of the optimism of these hypotheses?
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.120]   - Yeah, it's actually a good way that you frame it
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   because I'm always somewhat repelled
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   by views of the world that start from the negative,
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.920]   try to cut down an idea,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   try to say that's the wrong way of thinking
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.400]   about things and so on.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.720]   I'm much more drawn, maybe because I'm an optimist,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.760]   I don't know, I'm much more drawn
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.640]   to those who go out into the world with new ideas.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.900]   And don't try to cut down one idea,
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.840]   but rather present another one that might be better.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.760]   And so you make the first idea, maybe strengthy, irrelevant,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.360]   because you've come up with the better approach
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.580]   to the world.
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.040]   So do I think it's healthy?
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   Look, I think having a wide range of views
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.600]   and perspectives is generally a healthy thing.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.480]   I think it's good to have arguments within a subject
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.720]   in order that you stay fresh
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.440]   and you stay focused on the things that matter.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.760]   But in the end of the day,
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.960]   I think it's a more vital contribution
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.300]   to give us something new
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.600]   rather than to criticize something that's there.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.040]   - Yeah, I'm totally with you.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.840]   But it could be just the nature of being an optimist
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.280]   and also just a love of engineering.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   It helps nobody by criticizing the rocket
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.640]   that somebody else built.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.600]   Just build a bigger, cheaper, better rocket.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   - Right, exactly.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.000]   - And that seems to be how human civilization
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.460]   can progress effectively.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.960]   We've mentioned the second law of thermodynamics.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.920]   I gotta ask you about time.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.760]   - Yeah.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.400]   - And do you think of time as emergent
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.760]   or fundamental to our universe?
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.120]   - I like to think of it as emergent.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.980]   I don't have a solid reason for that perspective.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.760]   I have a lot of hints of reasons,
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.400]   that some of which come out of string theory
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.160]   and quantum gravity
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.180]   that perhaps would be worth talking about.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.960]   But what I would say is time is
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.080]   the most familiar quality of experience
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.960]   because there's nothing that takes place
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.200]   that doesn't take place within an interval of time.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.560]   And yet at the same time,
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.440]   it is perhaps the most mysterious quality of the world.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.000]   So it's a wonderful confluence of the familiar
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   and the deeply mysterious all in one little package.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.800]   If you were to ask me, what is time?
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   I don't really know.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.040]   I don't think anybody does.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.280]   I can say what time gives us.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.760]   It allows us the language for talking about change.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.620]   It allows us to envision the events of the universe
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.880]   being spread out in this temporal timeline.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.220]   And in that way,
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.680]   allows us to see the patterns that unfold within time.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.120]   I mean, time allows us the structure
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.600]   and the organization to think about things
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.920]   in that kind of a progression.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.440]   But what actually is it?
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.740]   I don't really know.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.400]   And that's so strange because we can measure it, right?
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.060]   I mean, there are laboratories in the world
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.100]   that measure this thing called time
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.000]   to spectacular precision.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.440]   But if you go up to the folks and say,
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.920]   what is it that you're actually measuring?
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.580]   I don't know that they can really articulate
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.220]   the kind of answer that you would expect
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.400]   from those who are engineering a device
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.520]   that can measure something called time
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.120]   to that level of precision.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.920]   So it's a very curious combination.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.260]   - What do you make of the one way feeling of causality?
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.380]   Like is causality a thing
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.580]   or is that too just a human story
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.780]   that we put on top of this emergent phenomenon of time?
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.220]   - I don't know.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.940]   I can give you my guess and my intuition about it.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.180]   I do think that at the macroscopic level,
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.280]   if we're talking about sort of the human experience of time,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.320]   I do think at the macroscopic level,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.180]   there is a fundamental notion of causality
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.060]   that does emerge from a starting point
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.740]   that may not have causality built in.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.100]   So I certainly would allow that
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.280]   at the deepest description of reality,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.900]   when we finally have that on the table,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.700]   we may not see causality directly
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.540]   at that fundamental level.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.260]   But I do believe that we will understand
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.340]   how to go from that fundamental level
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.440]   to a world where at the macroscopic level,
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.460]   there is this notion of A causes B,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.660]   a notion that Einstein deeply embraced
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.140]   in his special theory of relativity,
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.840]   where he showed that time has qualities
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.280]   that we wouldn't expect based on experience.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.740]   You and I, if we move relative to each other,
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.780]   our clocks tick off time at different rate.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.980]   And our clocks is just a means
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.520]   of measuring this thing called time.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.860]   So this is really time that we're talking about.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.100]   Time for you and time for me are different
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.280]   if we're in relative motion.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.500]   He then shows in the general theory of relativity
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.060]   that if we're experiencing different gravity,
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.300]   different gravitational fields
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.280]   or actually more precisely,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.180]   different gravitational potentials,
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.660]   time will elapse for us at different rates.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.980]   These are things that are astoundingly strange
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.700]   that give rise to a scientific notion of time travel.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.460]   Okay, so this is how far Einstein took us
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.180]   in wiping away the old understanding of time
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.420]   and injecting a new understanding of its qualities.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.420]   So there's so much about time that's counterintuitive,
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.780]   but I do not think that we're ever going
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.340]   to wipe away causality at the macroscopic level.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.260]   - At the macroscopic, I mean,
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.620]   there's so many interesting things
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.060]   at the macroscopic level that may only exist
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.660]   at the macroscopic level.
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.180]   Like we already talked about consciousness
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.080]   that very well could be one of the things.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.260]   You mentioned time travel.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:07.020]   So I mean, according to Einstein,
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:11.140]   and in general, what types of travel
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.020]   do you think our physical universe allows?
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.060]   - Well, it certainly allows time travel to the future.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.660]   And I'm not talking about the silly thing
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.420]   that you and I are now going into the future
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.420]   second by second by second.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.740]   I'm talking about really the version
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.500]   that you see in Hollywood,
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.140]   at least in terms of its net effect,
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:34.140]   whereby an individual can follow an Einsteinian strategy
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.660]   and propel themselves into the future
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.260]   in some sense more quickly.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:45.140]   So if I wanted to see what's happening
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.300]   on planet Earth one million years from now,
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.500]   Einstein tells me how to get one million years from now.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.340]   Build a ship.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.380]   I got to turn to guys who know how to build stuff.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.980]   I can't do it like you.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.020]   Build a ship that can go out into the universe
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.780]   near the speed of light, turn around and come back.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.420]   Let's say it's a six month journey out,
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.060]   a six month journey back.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.420]   And Einstein tells me how fast I need to travel,
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.180]   how close to the speed of light I need to go
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.740]   so that when I step out of my ship,
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.980]   it will now be one million years
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.140]   into the future on planet Earth.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.300]   And this is not a controversial statement, right?
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.940]   This is not something where there's differences of opinion
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.340]   in the scientific community.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.900]   Any scientist who knows anything
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.080]   about what Einstein taught us agrees with what I just said.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.660]   It's commonplace, it's bread and butter physics.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.700]   And so that kind of travel to the future
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.180]   is absolutely allowed by the laws of physics.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.860]   There are engineering challenges,
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.980]   there are technological challenges.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.500]   - Closer to the speed of light part, yeah.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.780]   - Yeah, and there are even biological challenges, right?
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.220]   There are G-forces that you're gonna experience.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.780]   So there's all sorts of stuff embedded in this.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.020]   But those I will call the details.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.380]   And those details, notwithstanding,
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.820]   the universe allows this kind of travel to the future.
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.660]   - And if I could pause real quick,
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.620]   you could also, at the macro level,
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.360]   with biology, extend the human lifespan
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.260]   to do a kind of travel forward in time.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.560]   If you expand how long we live,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.320]   that's a way to, from a perspective of an observer,
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.800]   a conscious observer that is a human being,
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.920]   you're essentially traveling forward in time
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.440]   by allowing yourself to live long enough to see the thing.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.280]   - Yes.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.920]   - So in the space of biology,
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.160]   what about traveling back in time?
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.960]   - Yeah, that is a natural next question,
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.560]   especially if you're going on one of these journeys.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.800]   Is it a one-way journey?
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.620]   - Yeah.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.840]   - Or can you come back?
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.480]   And the physics community doesn't speak
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.200]   with a unified voice on this as yet.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.860]   But I would say that the dominant perspective
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.240]   is that you cannot get back.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.880]   Now, having said that, there are proposals
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.280]   that serious people have written papers on
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.080]   regarding hypothetical ways
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.920]   in which you could travel to the past.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.500]   And we've seen some of these.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.920]   Again, Hollywood loves to take the most sexy ideas
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.040]   of physics and build narratives around them.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.960]   This idea of a wormhole,
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.480]   like Jodie Foster in "Contact" went through a wormhole.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.860]   Deep Space Nine star, I'm sure there are many other examples
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.500]   for these ideas that I've probably never even seen.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.480]   But with wormholes, there's at least a proposal
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.240]   of how you could take a wormhole, tunnel through space-time,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.520]   manipulate the openings of the wormhole
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.120]   in such a way that the openings are no longer synchronous.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.320]   They are out of sync relative to each other,
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.000]   which would mean one's ahead and one's behind,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.480]   which means if you go through one direction,
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.640]   you travel to the future.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.360]   If you go back, you travel to the past.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.760]   Now, we don't know if there are wormholes
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.600]   in the world. - But they're possible
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.840]   according to Einstein, correct?
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.760]   - They are possible according to Einstein,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.400]   but even Einstein was very quick to say,
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.240]   just because my math allows for something,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.080]   doesn't mean it's real.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.880]   And he famously didn't even believe in black holes.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.920]   Didn't believe in the Big Bang, right?
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.160]   And yet the black hole issue has really been settled now.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.740]   We have radio telescopic photographs
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.800]   of the black hole in M87.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.240]   It was in newspapers around the world
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.360]   just a couple of years ago.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.160]   So it's just to say that just because
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   it's in Einstein's math, it doesn't mean it's real.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.960]   But yes, it is the case that wormholes
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.640]   are allowed by Einstein's equations.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.880]   And in principle, you can imagine putting electric charges
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.280]   on the openings of the wormhole,
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.840]   allowing you to tow them around in a manner
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.120]   that could yield this temporal asymmetry between them.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.760]   Maybe you tow one of the mouths to the edge of a black hole.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.340]   In principle, you can do this,
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.520]   slowing down the passage of time near that black hole.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.100]   And then when you bring it back,
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.020]   it will be well out of sync with the other opening.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.360]   And therefore, it could be a significant temporal gap
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.060]   between one and the other.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.800]   But people who study this in more detail question,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.020]   could you ever keep a wormhole open,
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.720]   assuming it does exist?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.380]   Could you ever travel through a wormhole?
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.660]   Or would there be a requirement
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.900]   of some kind of exotic matter to prop it open
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.380]   that perhaps doesn't exist?
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.020]   So there are many, many issues that people have raised.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.020]   And I would say that the general sentiment
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.740]   is that it's unlikely that this kind of scenario
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.940]   is going to survive our deeper understanding of physics
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.180]   when we finally have it.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.300]   But that doesn't mean that the door is closed.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.780]   So maybe there's a small possibility
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.940]   that this could one day be resolved.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.460]   - That's such an interesting way to put it.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.100]   This kind of scenario will not survive
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.540]   our deeper understanding of physics.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.860]   It's an interesting way to put it
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:59.740]   because it makes you wonder what kind of scenarios
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:04.100]   will be created by our deeper understanding of physics.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.380]   Maybe, sorry to go crazy for a second,
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.240]   but if you have like the panpsychism idea
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.220]   that consciousness permeates all matter,
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:18.020]   maybe traveling in that, whatever laws of physics
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.180]   the consciousness operates under or something like that,
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.740]   in that view of the universe,
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.180]   if we somehow are able to understand that part,
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.460]   maybe traveling is super easy.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.300]   - Yeah.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.380]   - It does not follow the constraints
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.740]   of the speed of light, something like this.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.740]   - Yeah, so look, I have a definite degree of sympathy
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:42.660]   with the possibility that consciousness might be
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.540]   more than what we described earlier
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.220]   as just the byproduct of mindless particles.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.740]   - You just made the rock happy.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.340]   - Exactly, so it isn't the approach
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.340]   that feels to me the most likely, but I see the logic.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.700]   If you've got the puzzle,
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.300]   how do mindless particles build mind,
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.320]   one resolution might be the particles are not mindless.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.960]   The particles have some kind of proto-conscious quality.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.020]   So there's something appealing
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.220]   about that straightforward solution to the puzzle.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.500]   And if that's the case,
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.180]   if we do live in a pan-psychist world
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.420]   where there's a degree of consciousness
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.700]   residing in everything in the world around us,
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.960]   then yes, I do think some interesting possibilities
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.740]   might emerge where maybe there's a way of communing
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.740]   with physical reality in a deeper way than we have so far.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.660]   I mean, we as human beings,
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.580]   a vital part of our existence
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.880]   is human to human communication, contact.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.300]   We live in social groups,
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.040]   and that's what has allowed us to get to the place
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:48.880]   where we've gotten.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.740]   Imagine that we have long missed
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.740]   that there's other consciousness out there
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.540]   and some kind of relationship or communion
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.020]   with that larger conscious possibility
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.420]   would take us to a different place.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.880]   Now, do I buy into this yet?
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.460]   I don't, I don't see any evidence for it,
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.340]   but do I have an open mind
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.460]   and allow for the possibility in the future?
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.380]   Yeah, I do.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.420]   - So if that's not the case
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.440]   and you have these simple particles
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.900]   that at the macro level emerges some interesting stuff
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.900]   like consciousness,
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.500]   another thing you write about in the
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.340]   "Until the End of Time" book
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.900]   is the thing that it seems to emerge at the macro level
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:35.020]   is the feeling like there's a free will,
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.540]   like we decide to do stuff.
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.140]   And you have a really interesting take here,
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:43.340]   which is no, there's not a free will.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.620]   I'm just gonna speak for you
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.900]   and then you can correct me.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.060]   No, there's not a free will,
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.440]   but there is an experience of freedom.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.100]   - Which I really love.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.400]   So where does the experience,
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.780]   where does freedom come from
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.700]   if we don't have any kind of physics-based free will?
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.820]   - Yeah, and so the idea follows naturally
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.480]   from all that we've been talking about.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.500]   Let's make the assumption
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.220]   that all there is in the physical universe
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.380]   is stuff governed by laws.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.500]   We may not have those laws,
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.500]   may not know what the fundamental stuff is yet,
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.700]   but everything we know in science points in the direction
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:27.860]   that it's physical stuff governed by universal laws.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.380]   And that being the case or that being the assumption,
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.880]   then you come to a particular collection
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.020]   of those ingredients called the human being.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.120]   And that human being has particles
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.580]   that are fully governed by physical law.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.060]   And when you then recognize it,
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.340]   every thought that we have,
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.460]   every action that we undertake
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.380]   is just the motion of particles.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.860]   When I'm thinking thoughts right now,
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:53.820]   of course, at this level of description,
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.260]   it is the motion of particles cascading
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.780]   down various neurons inside of my head and so on.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.780]   And every single one of those motions,
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.300]   collectively and individually,
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.500]   is fully governed by these laws
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.860]   that we perhaps don't have yet,
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.060]   but we imagine one day we will.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.780]   That leaves no opportunity for any kind of freedom
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.580]   to break free from the constraint of physical law.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.620]   And that is the end of the story.
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.460]   So the traditional intuitive notion of free will,
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.860]   that we're the ultimate authors of our actions,
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.300]   that we were the buck stops,
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.240]   that there is no antecedent,
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.000]   that is the cause for our deciding to go left or right,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.180]   choose vanilla or chocolate, live or die,
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:42.020]   that intuitive sensation does not have a basis
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.740]   in our understanding of the physical world.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.100]   So that's the end of the free will of the traditional sort.
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.060]   But then your question is,
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.900]   what about this other kind of freedom I talk about?
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.860]   And the other kind of freedom,
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.820]   if you focus on it intently,
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:00.660]   I think is actually the true version of freedom
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.140]   that we feel.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:04.260]   And that freedom is this.
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.980]   You look at inanimate objects in the world,
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:10.100]   rocks, bottles of water, whatever,
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:13.300]   they have a very limited behavioral repertoire.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.140]   Why?
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.060]   Their internal organization is too coarse
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.860]   for them to do very much, right?
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:22.000]   You try to have a conversation with a glass of water,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.780]   you send sound waves, it doesn't do much.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.120]   It may vibrate a little bit,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.180]   but the repertoire of responses are incredibly limited.
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.020]   The difference between us and a rock or a bottle of water
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.080]   is that our inner organization,
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.380]   by virtue of eons of evolution by natural selection,
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.700]   is so refined, so spectacularly ordered,
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.420]   that we have a huge repertoire of behaviors
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.420]   that are finely attuned to stimuli from the external world.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.300]   You ask me a question, that's a stimulus,
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.420]   and all of a sudden,
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.820]   these particle processes go into action,
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.040]   and this is the result, this answer that I'm giving you.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.100]   So the freedom that we have
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.560]   is not from the control of physical law.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.220]   The freedom that we have is from the constrained behavior
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.340]   that has long since governed inanimate objects.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:14.660]   We are liberated from the limited behavioral repertoire
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:17.180]   of rocks and bottles of water
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.060]   to have this broad spectrum of responses.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:20.900]   Do we pick them?
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.800]   We do not.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.040]   Do we freely choose them?
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.060]   We do not, but yet we have them,
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:29.320]   and we can marvel at those behaviors,
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.480]   and that's the freedom that we have.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.300]   - The complexity and the breadth of that repertoire
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.720]   is where the freedom emerges.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.240]   Is there something to be said about emergence?
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.880]   I don't know if you know or have looked at much
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.280]   about objects that I seem to love way more than anyone else,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.720]   which is cellular top, like game of life type of stuff.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.720]   From simple things emerges beautiful complexity,
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.980]   and so that's that repertoire.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:03.980]   It's like it seems if you have enough stuff,
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.300]   just beautiful complexity emerges
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.600]   that sure as heck to our human eyes looks
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.040]   like there's consciousness there, there's free will,
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.640]   there's little objects moving about and making decisions.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:16.820]   I mean, all of that.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.920]   You could say it's anthropomorphization,
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.500]   but it sure as heck feels like
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.560]   there are organisms making decisions.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.660]   What is that emergence thing?
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:31.220]   Is that within the realm of physics to understand?
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:35.020]   Is it within the realm of poetry?
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:38.640]   What is that, like complex systems, emergence?
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.620]   What is that?
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.580]   Will that ever be understood by science?
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.980]   - So here's the way that I think about it.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.820]   So there are clearly qualities of the world
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.000]   that emerge on macroscopic scales.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.740]   Our sense of beauty, wonder, consciousness,
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.900]   all these kinds of qualities.
[00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:00.180]   Do I feel that they ultimately are explainable
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.180]   from the laws of physics?
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.540]   I do.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.300]   There is nothing that's not ultimately explainable
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.460]   with the laws of physics from this physicalist perspective,
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.880]   which is what I take.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.980]   So you got the particles, you got the laws,
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.180]   and you have things that emerge
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.780]   from the choreographed motions of those particles.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.060]   But is that the best language
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.100]   for talking about these emergent qualities?
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.540]   Usually not.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.920]   If I was to take something even more mundane,
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.180]   like a baseball flying through the air,
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.680]   if I was to describe it in terms of the quarks
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.020]   and the electrons, I'd give you this mountain of data
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:44.020]   with 10 to the 28 particles and all of their coordinates
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.900]   and spaces as a function of time.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.380]   I hand you this mountain of data, you're like,
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.180]   I don't know what this is.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.180]   And then if you really were clever and you look at,
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:54.020]   oh, it's a baseball just described
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.060]   in the least economical way possible,
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:00.240]   it is much more useful and insightful
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.960]   to talk about the baseball flying through the air.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.680]   Similarly, there are things at the macroscopic level
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   like human experience and human emotion and human action
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   and the sensation of free will that we undeniably all have,
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.420]   even if it itself doesn't have a basis
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.460]   in our understanding of the physical world.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.720]   It's useful to talk about things
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.340]   in this very human language.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.700]   And so, yes, it's vital to talk about things
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.380]   in the poetic language of human experience,
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.820]   but do not lose sight of the fact, and some people do,
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.880]   they say, oh, it's just an emergent phenomenon.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.100]   Don't lose sight of the fact that emergent phenomena
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.820]   are emerging from this deeper understanding
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.820]   that comes from the reductionist account of physical law.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.840]   And there's a lot of insight to come from that,
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.580]   such as the freedom that you thought that you had,
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.340]   the freedom of will that you thought you had.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.180]   It doesn't have a basis in that reductionist account,
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.300]   so it's not real.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:59.060]   - So speaking of the poetry of human experience,
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.140]   you mentioned the images of the black holes.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   How did it make you feel a few years ago
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.820]   when that first image came out?
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.280]   - Truly amazing.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   A sense of, well, I guess the feeling was both amazing
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.800]   and there was a little sense of,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.340]   jealousy's not quite the right word,
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.540]   but a sense of longing.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.920]   Yeah, I think that's a better word,
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.460]   because here's a subject that started with Einstein
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.520]   back in 1915, writes down the equations
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.620]   of the general theory of relativity,
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:34.820]   and then there are scores of individuals over the decades,
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.500]   starting with people like Karl Schwarzschild,
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.860]   who analyzed the equation,
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.340]   see the possibility of black holes.
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.620]   People develop these ideas.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.140]   John Wheeler, all these greats of physics.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.460]   It's still a hypothetical subject.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.900]   It gets closer to reality through observations
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.460]   of the center of our galaxy,
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.360]   stars whipping around in a manner
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.580]   that could only really be explained
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.900]   by there being a black hole in the center of our galaxy,
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.740]   but it was still indirect.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.540]   To actually have a direct image that you can look at,
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.140]   what a beautiful arc, narrative arc,
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.140]   from the theoretical to the absolutely established,
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.600]   and that's what we hope will happen with other areas,
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.100]   for instance, string theory, right?
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.580]   I mean, holy mathematical subject at the outset,
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:22.540]   and still pretty much a holy mathematical subject today.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.860]   Yeah, do we long for that image
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.500]   where we can look at it and say, string, it's real.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.780]   I mean, how thrilling, how thrilling
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.340]   to be part of that journey,
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.100]   to be part of that step that moves things
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.000]   from the abstract to the concrete.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.820]   - Yeah, so like the image of the DNA,
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.860]   the early images of the DNA, for example,
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.540]   but there is something, especially,
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.940]   so the problem with strings is they're tiny,
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.620]   so it's harder to take a picture.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.900]   In the following sense, when you think of a black hole,
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   I mean, you have a swirl of, I guess,
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.380]   what is, I don't even know, it's dust, whatever, light.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.580]   - Accreting onto the event horizon.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.660]   - And then there's darkness in the center,
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.140]   and you just imagine, so that picture in particular,
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.780]   I guess, is of a gigantic black hole, so you just,
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.180]   I mean, it's terrifying.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.580]   - Billions of times the mass of the sun.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.900]   - Yeah, so it's both exciting and terrifying.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.060]   I mean, I don't know where you fall on the spectrum.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.900]   I think it's exciting at first,
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.300]   like the longer I think about it,
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.460]   every time I think about it,
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.300]   the more terrifying it becomes.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.300]   So it always starts exciting,
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.740]   and then it goes to terrifying,
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.140]   and both are feelings, very human feelings
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.380]   that I appreciate.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.740]   It's like terrified awe, somehow, is still beautiful.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.940]   - That's a good way of saying it,
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.940]   and I think I kind of share that reaction,
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.220]   because there is a way in which,
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.340]   when you work on this subject, like all the time,
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.540]   I teach it, I teach about black holes,
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.540]   write the equations on the blackboard.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:01.800]   The ideas reside in a very cognitive,
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.460]   I don't know, mathematical portion of the brain,
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.280]   or at least for me.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.900]   And it's only when you sit down, and it's quiet,
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.020]   and you start to contemplate,
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:13.860]   wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.180]   this isn't just like a mathematical game.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.420]   There are these monsters out there.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.740]   Now, not in a sense of I fear for my life,
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:27.740]   but it's a sense of how extraordinary is this universe.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.460]   And so it is breathtaking.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.940]   - How powerful nature is.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:36.500]   - Yeah, how stupendously powerful nature is.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:42.120]   And so there is a deep sense of humility
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.960]   that I think this instills,
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.680]   if you really allow the ideas to sink in.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.760]   - Well, I have to ask about
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.720]   the most stupendously powerful thing
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.360]   to have ever happened in our universe,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.560]   which is the Big Bang.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.920]   What's up with the Big Bang?
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.360]   So we can, I mean, with gravitational waves,
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.640]   the hope is, when you have more and more accurate
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.040]   measurements of the gravitational waves,
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.420]   you can crawl back further and further back in time
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.600]   towards the Big Bang.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.460]   Do you have a hope that we'll be able to understand
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:18.100]   the early spark that created our universe?
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:18.940]   - Yeah.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:23.300]   - You know, that and the deep interior of a black hole
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.940]   are, I think, the biggest mysteries that we hope
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.740]   the melding of quantum mechanics and gravity will reveal,
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.440]   will illuminate.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.980]   And, you know, what question could be more captivating
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.940]   than why is there something rather than nothing, right?
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:43.260]   Why is there a universe at all?
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.340]   And will the theories that we're developing
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.500]   take us to an answer to that?
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.740]   I don't know.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.660]   Even if we truly knew what the Big Bang is,
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.500]   and that's a big question in its own right,
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.660]   one would still be left with the question, well, okay.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.340]   So you've explained the process by which
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.340]   a tiny nugget of a universe, a tiny nugget of space-time
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:10.060]   can undergo some kind of growth to yield the world around us
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.940]   but presumably in that explanation,
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.380]   you're gonna involve mathematics and some ingredients
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:21.380]   like quantum fields or matter or energy or something.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.160]   Where did that stuff come from?
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.900]   You know, can we get to that level of explanation?
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.120]   I don't know, but it is remarkable
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   that if you ask what happened a millionth of a second
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.020]   after the Big Bang,
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.240]   it's not really that controversial any longer, right?
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.760]   Even though there's a lot of argument in the field
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.400]   and it's very heated right now, I should say,
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.920]   regarding what is the right theory of the Big Bang?
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.440]   What is the right theory of early universe cosmology?
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.040]   Where I mean early, much earlier than a millionth of a second
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.040]   a lot of dissent, a lot of heated arguments about that--
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.680]   - No pun intended.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.280]   - Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.180]   But you go like a millionth of a second after that
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.080]   and we're on pretty firm ground.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.160]   Isn't that amazing, right?
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.400]   To understand what happened from that point forward.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.220]   But to go back is controversial.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:21.600]   So there is this theory called inflationary cosmology
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.560]   which I would say has been the dominant paradigm
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.120]   since early 1980s.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:27.960]   So what does that mean?
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.920]   Roughly 40 years now,
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.360]   it's been the dominant cosmological paradigm.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.760]   And it makes use of a curious feature
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.000]   of Einstein's general theory of relativity,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.260]   his theory of gravity,
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.800]   where Einstein shows us mathematically
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.840]   that gravity can not only be attractive,
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.280]   the kind of gravity that we're used to,
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.420]   things pulled together, but it can also be repulsive.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.420]   And that fact is then leveraged by people like Alan Guth
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.240]   and Andre Linde and at the time Paul Steinhardt
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.760]   and Andreas Hallbrecht and others to say,
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.400]   okay, if we had a little nugget in the early universe
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.520]   which was filled with the stuff
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.520]   that yields this repulsive gravity,
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.360]   well, that would have blown everything apart.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.240]   It would cause everything to swell.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.040]   Beautiful explanation for what the bang in the Big Bang was.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.720]   And then people mathematically analyze
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.760]   the consequences of this idea
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.480]   and they make predictions for tiny temperature differences
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.840]   across the night sky that in principle could be measured.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.120]   You send up balloons, you send up satellites
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.920]   with very refined thermometers
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.000]   and they measure the temperature of the night sky
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.800]   and the statistical distribution
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.040]   of the temperature differences
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.280]   agrees with the mathematical predictions.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:43.200]   I mean, you just sort of have to stand in awe
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.560]   of this insight.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.320]   So you think, aha, the theory has been established.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.320]   But scientists are an incredibly skeptical bunch
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.640]   and some scientists, including one of the people
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.400]   who helped develop the theory at the outset,
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.960]   Paul Steinhardt, comes along and says,
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.120]   well, yeah, this theory's done pretty well so far
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.480]   but there are aspects of this theory
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.180]   that are making me lose confidence.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.880]   For instance, this theory seems to suggest
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.380]   that there might be other universes.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.300]   Like how do you make sense of a theory
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.880]   that suggests there are other universes?
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.920]   Or there are others who come along and say,
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.240]   this theory seems to talk about length scales
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.680]   that are minuscule even by the so-called Planck length,
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.360]   the sort of shortest length that we can imagine
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.840]   making sense of in a theory of quantum gravity.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.440]   How do you make sense of that?
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.280]   And so on and so forth.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.720]   They develop a list of things that they consider
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.600]   to be chinks in the inflationary cosmological theory's armor
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.080]   and they develop other ideas which they claim
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.640]   yield the same predictions as inflationary cosmology
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.440]   for those temperature differences across space
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.840]   but don't suffer from these problems.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.120]   And then the inflationary cosmology folks say,
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.760]   no, no, no, hang on.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.920]   Your theory suffers from different problems.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.600]   And so the arguments goes, it's a healthy debate.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.120]   Talk about real debates in science.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.800]   So when you ask what's up with the Big Bang,
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.940]   I don't know right now.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.760]   If you would have asked me five years ago,
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.160]   maybe even less than that, three or four years ago,
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.280]   I would have said, look,
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.080]   inflationary cosmology has some issues
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.560]   but the package of explanations it provides is so potent
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.560]   and the issues that beset it are seemingly solvable to me
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.920]   that I would imagine it's going to in the end win out.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.180]   I would still say that today
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.160]   but I wouldn't say it as loudly.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.800]   I wouldn't say it as confidently.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.140]   I think it's worth thinking about alternate ideas
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.300]   and it could be the case that the paradigm
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.720]   at some point shifts.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.520]   - Does dark matter and dark energy fit into the shifting
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.560]   of the explanations for those?
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.400]   - Yeah, certainly.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   So dark energy has in the inflationary theory
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.260]   is kind of a big mystery.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.260]   So dark energy is the observational realization
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.480]   in the last 20 years that not only is universe expanding,
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.560]   it's expanding ever more quickly.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.120]   Something is still pushing things outward
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.360]   and the explanation is that there's like a residual version
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.600]   of the repulsive gravity from the early universe
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.020]   but it's such a strange number.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.660]   When you write that amount of dark energy
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:29.120]   using the relevant units in a theory of quantum gravity,
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.080]   it's a decimal point followed by like 120 zeros
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.680]   and then a one.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.300]   We're not used to those kinds of numbers in physics.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:43.300]   We're used to a half, one, pi, E squared to two.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.740]   Those are the kinds of fundamental numbers
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.880]   that emerge in our explanations of the world
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.960]   and we look at this bizarre number,
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.780]   decimal point, all these zeros and a one,
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.200]   we say something's wrong there.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.640]   Like where would that number have come from?
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.800]   Now there are people who suggest resolution to it
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.600]   so it's not like we're totally in the dark on it
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.680]   but those people like Paul Steinhardt
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.080]   who have alternate cosmological theories,
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.120]   cyclic cosmologies as they call it,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.440]   claim that they have a more natural explanation
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.160]   of the dark energy that it naturally feeds
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.160]   into a cyclical process that is their cosmological paradigm.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.200]   So yeah, if the cosmology should change,
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.800]   it's conceivable our view of dark energy may change
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.480]   from deeply mysterious to deeply integrated
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.200]   into a different paradigm.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.520]   That is possible.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.400]   - I think it's Roger Penrose that think
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.440]   that information can bleed through
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.920]   from before the Big Bang to after the Big Bang.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.760]   - Yeah.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.840]   - Is the Big Bang like a full erasure of the hard drive
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.880]   or is there some information that could bleed through?
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.880]   - Yeah, I mean, so Roger is among the most creative thinkers
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.200]   of the last hundred years, rightly won the Nobel Prize
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.000]   for his insights into singularities in space time
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.480]   that we know to afflict our mathematical solutions
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.120]   of black holes and the Big Bang and so forth.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:13.120]   And he has an enormously fertile imagination
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.320]   and I mean that in the most positive sense.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.640]   And so he has put forward this idea,
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.880]   this conformal cyclic cosmology,
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.760]   I think is the official title
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.320]   although I could be getting that wrong.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.940]   I can't say that I've studied it.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.280]   I have seen lectures on it.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.280]   I don't find it convincing as yet.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.280]   It feels like it's being built to find a solution
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.200]   as opposed to sort of more naturally emerging.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.920]   Maybe Roger would say otherwise
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.440]   and I don't mean to in any way cast aspersions on the work.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.720]   It's vital and interesting
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.400]   and people are thinking about it.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   I don't consider it as close a competitor
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.100]   to say the inflationary theory as for instance,
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.840]   the stuff that Paul Steinhardt has put forward.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.200]   But again, you've got to keep an open mind in this business
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.640]   when there's so much that we don't yet understand.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.600]   - I mean, it is wild to think that information
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.880]   could survive something like that.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.320]   Just like it is wild to imagine
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.560]   that information could escape a black hole for example.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.160]   It just seems like by construction,
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   these things are supposed to not bleed out anything.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.840]   - But one of the challenges in all of these theories
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.640]   is when we talk about a singularity,
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.220]   has this real sexy term, the singularity.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:33.580]   But a singularity is in more ordinary language,
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.760]   a physical system where the mathematics breaks down.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.100]   It's nonsensical.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.820]   It's like taking one divided by zero.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.700]   You put that into a calculator and it says E, error.
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.220]   It does not make sense, doesn't compute.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   And so it's very hard to make definitive statements
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.660]   about things like the Big Bang or about black holes
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.340]   until we cure the mathematical singularities.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.540]   And there are some who claim that in certain regimes,
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:06.260]   the singularities have been cured.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.020]   I don't by any mean think that there's consensus
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.040]   on these ideas.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.320]   So when one talks about information
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.740]   sort of bleeding through the Big Bang,
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.460]   you've really got to make sure
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.340]   that the equations have no singularity.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.740]   You talk about cyclic cosmology,
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.860]   you've got to make sure
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.660]   that the equations don't have any singularities
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.180]   as you go from say one cycle to the next.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.140]   Now, some of the proponents of these theories claim
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.060]   that they have resolved these issues.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.660]   I don't think that there's a general sense
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.260]   that that is the case as yet,
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.340]   but it could be that, look, life is so short
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.700]   that I haven't had the time to deeply delve
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.500]   into all the mathematical intricacies
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.260]   of all the ideas that have been put forward.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.240]   If I did that, I'd never do anything else.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.700]   But that's what the issue is.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.400]   - And of course, it's just math.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.780]   There may be holes.
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:52.940]   There may be gaps in our understanding
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.100]   in the way we're modeling physical reality.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:55.940]   - Well, that's the point.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.500]   In fact, when you said I was about to jump in
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.380]   and say modeling, but you got there first
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.100]   and it's exactly the right point.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.660]   We're talking about the universe here, right?
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.980]   And how do you talk about the universe
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.980]   with a straight face mathematically?
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.060]   And the way you do it is you simplify,
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.660]   you throw away those characteristics of the universe
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:18.500]   that you don't think are vital to a full understanding.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.580]   And so we're gonna get to a point,
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.560]   people are starting to,
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.780]   where we've got to go beyond those simplifications.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.060]   And so cosmology has for a long time
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.460]   modeled the universe in the most simplest terms,
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.340]   homogeneous, isotropic.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.940]   It has just a few parameters that describe it,
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.580]   the average density of mass and energy and so forth.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.380]   We have to go beyond those simplifications
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.420]   and that will require putting these things on computers.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.220]   We're not gonna be able to do calculations there.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.660]   So much as astrophysics has gone beyond many simplifications
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:53.300]   to now give really detailed simulations of star systems
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.940]   and galaxies and so forth,
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.900]   we're gonna have to do that with cosmology
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.140]   and people are starting to do that today.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.940]   - Yeah, I've seen some interesting work on simulation.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.780]   Most simulation cosmology, by the way, is just awesome.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.740]   But just like simulation of the early formation
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:13.020]   of our solar system to understand how the Oort cloud
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.580]   and just, I don't know, the whole of it,
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:18.380]   how Earth came to be,
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.180]   like how Jupiter just the full--
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.020]   - Protects us.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:26.260]   - Protects us and then there's like weird like moons
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:30.620]   and volcanoes and like modeling all of that,
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.440]   the formation of all of that is fascinating.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.100]   Because that naturally is the question
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.180]   of how does life emerge on these kinds of rocks?
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.980]   How does a rock become a rabbit?
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:47.420]   But speaking of models,
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:50.340]   there's an equation called the Drake equation.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.700]   We were talking about life.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:56.380]   Have to ask at the highest level first,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.060]   when you look out there,
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:01.220]   how many alien civilization do you think are out there?
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:04.660]   Well, zero, one or many?
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:08.200]   So if you say civilization,
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.420]   I would bring my number way down.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.860]   It could be zero.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.660]   If you talk about life,
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.620]   I think it could be many.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.780]   As we were saying before,
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:25.820]   I think the move from life to consciousness,
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.460]   the kinds of beings that would build
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.700]   what we would recognize as a civilization,
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.220]   that may be extraordinarily rare.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.300]   I hope it's not.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:38.060]   As a kid, I loved Star Trek.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.580]   I just loved the idea that we would be part
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.660]   of some universal community where,
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.020]   look, experience on planet Earth
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.120]   suggests it doesn't always go so well
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.900]   when groups who are separated try to come together
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.780]   and live in some larger collective.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.940]   But again, as an optimist,
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.900]   how amazing would it be to converse
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.140]   with an alien civilization
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.420]   and learn what they've figured out
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:05.320]   about physics and cosmology and compare notes
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:09.300]   and learn from each other in some wonderful way.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.500]   I love that idea.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.780]   But if you ask me the likelihood of it,
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:18.560]   I would err on saying it may be so improbable
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.700]   that the conditions conspire to allow life
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.680]   to move to this place of consciousness
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.120]   that it might be rare.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.640]   - It might be oversimplifying things,
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.560]   but just observing the power of the evolutionary process,
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.360]   I tend to believe,
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.980]   and you read different theories of how we went,
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:42.320]   how Homo sapiens evolved.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:46.440]   It seems like the evolutionary process naturally leads
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   to Homo sapiens or creatures like that,
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.200]   or much better than that.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.320]   So to me, there's several scary scenarios.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.760]   So, okay, the positive scenario
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.240]   is life itself is really difficult.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.860]   So that origin of life is difficult.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.040]   That's exciting for many reasons
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:12.520]   because we might be able to prove that wrong easily
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.760]   in the near term by finding life elsewhere.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.940]   - Sure.
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.940]   - The scary thing to me is if life is easy
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.840]   and there's plenty of conscious,
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.780]   intelligent civilizations out there,
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.620]   and we have not obviously made contact,
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.340]   which means with intelligence and consciousness
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:38.340]   comes responsibility and ultimately destruction.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.780]   So with power comes great responsibility.
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:44.780]   And then we end up destroying ourselves.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.140]   That's the scariest.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.220]   The positive, I guess, version is that
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.080]   maybe we're being watched,
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:57.220]   sort of like there's a transition
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.820]   to where you don't want to ruin
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.400]   the primitive villages out there.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.180]   And so there's a protective layer around us.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.020]   - Yeah.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.620]   - They're watching.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.540]   So where do you, in these possible explanations,
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.260]   the Fermi paradox, why haven't we contacted aliens?
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.100]   - Yeah.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:13.920]   - Do you land on?
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.740]   - Well, I think the most straightforward explanation
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.380]   is that there aren't any.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.180]   Now, there are many other explanations too.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.620]   So you can't be dogmatic about things
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.700]   that are just sort of gut feel.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:31.860]   But one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes,
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.340]   I don't know if you ever saw this one,
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.380]   where this alien civilization
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.260]   finally comes to planet Earth
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:41.820]   and gives us this book that they really want us to have
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.700]   and to hold.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.620]   And it's in this foreign language, you don't understand it.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.140]   The cryptographers, they desperately try to decipher it
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:52.500]   as humans are going to visit this other alien planet.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.740]   And they're all sending back postcards,
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.260]   how wonderful it is and so forth.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.580]   And they finally decipher the title.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.340]   It's to serve man.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.500]   And everyone's so thrilled.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.620]   Oh, they're here to serve us.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.740]   It all makes sense.
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:06.260]   And then just as one of the final cryptographers
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.220]   is going on to the alien ship,
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.820]   his helper runs and says,
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.940]   "I've deciphered the rest of the book to serve man.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.020]   "It's a cookbook."
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:15.860]   You know, so.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:17.140]   (laughing)
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.380]   You know, so yeah.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.980]   Is that a possibility?
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.180]   Sure, you know.
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.020]   And so could they be watching us
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.180]   and just sort of waiting for us
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:29.700]   to get to a mature enough level?
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.140]   I don't know, it strikes me.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.380]   Well, you know, I think it'd be better
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.100]   to have this conversation after the James Webb telescope.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.460]   I mean, I do think that if we look
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.380]   at the atmospheres of many planets,
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.540]   I mean, there's now an estimate now
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:47.540]   that there's on order of one planet per star on average.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:50.020]   So we've long known that, you know,
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.820]   the galaxy, hundreds of billions of stars,
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.820]   numbers of galaxies, hundreds of billions of galaxies.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.700]   So we're talking about hundreds of billions
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.980]   of hundreds of billions of planets.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.060]   Oh my, you know.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:02.340]   And if we start to survey some of these planets
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:03.860]   and one after the other after the other,
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.420]   we just sort of find no evidence
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.460]   for any of the biological markers.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:11.340]   It could be, of course,
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.900]   maybe life takes a radically different form.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.440]   It'd be hard to know that.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.660]   But I think, you know, that would at least give us
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:19.420]   some insight on the life question.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.000]   But I just don't see how we get insight
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.140]   on the civilization or consciousness question
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.620]   without, you know, the direct connection.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:31.660]   And it strikes me that if consciousness is ubiquitous,
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.100]   let's say life is, I'm willing to grant that.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.300]   If consciousness is also ubiquitous,
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:41.700]   then I don't understand why they haven't been here
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.540]   or why there hasn't been sub-conception
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:47.940]   'cause presumably they should be much further ahead of us.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.240]   How unlikely would it be that we're like,
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.140]   of all consciousness in the universe,
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:53.540]   we're the most advanced.
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:57.020]   That'd be such a special place for human beings
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.180]   that it's hard for me to grant that as a likely possibility.
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.740]   Rather, I think we're kind of run of the mill.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.060]   And there are many who are far more advanced than us.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.120]   And I don't think that they would expend the energy
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.380]   to hide themselves.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.820]   So I don't think they care enough.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:15.920]   - And so, see, that's actually what I believe,
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.200]   that there's a very large number of civilizations
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.460]   that are far more advanced than us.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:25.240]   But my sense is that humans are exceptionally limited,
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.300]   both in our direct sensory capabilities and our physics,
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.860]   our tools of sensing,
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.260]   that just like with the string theory
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.620]   and the multiple dimensions, we're just not,
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:39.100]   I honestly believe there could be stuff
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.820]   in front of our nose that we're just not seeing
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:48.740]   'cause we're too dumb, too much hubris.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.940]   And I mean, there's a bunch of stuff,
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:54.940]   and too ignorant to the fabric of reality,
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.340]   all of those things.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.900]   We're young in terms of intelligence.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.060]   - But I guess what I say is,
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.140]   I'm on board with all of that as a real possibility.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.740]   But then it does strike me
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:11.740]   that we are sufficiently able to observe the,
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:16.780]   look, we can look back to a fraction of the duration
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:20.060]   from here to, just a fraction is left
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.720]   that we are unable to see.
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.400]   So however young we are,
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.160]   we have been able to sort of pierce the universe.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.320]   And it just strikes me that there would be some signature,
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.240]   but maybe that's coming.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.880]   But look, having said that, I do,
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.600]   look, I certainly note the fact that it's rare
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.140]   that I stoop down while walking in Manhattan
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:48.940]   and sort of dig up some ants in the bushes
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:51.560]   on the side of the street and talk to the ants, right?
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.960]   Because it's just not interesting to me.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.080]   So if we're like the ants on the cosmological landscape,
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.760]   then yeah, I can imagine that the super advanced aliens
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.960]   would be like, like whoever, you know.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.320]   But I feel like we're sufficiently advanced
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.200]   that there should be some signal signature of that,
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.320]   but maybe it's coming.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.120]   - I think the deeper fundamental problem
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.240]   between us and the ants
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.720]   is that we don't have a common language.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.600]   It's not the interest.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.280]   It's that we don't even have a common language.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.480]   And so the alien civilizations
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.840]   don't even know how to communicate.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.720]   Like we humans have convinced ourself we're special
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.920]   because we developed a language.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.760]   You talked about the importance of language
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.640]   to the intelligence, but it makes you wonder
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.640]   like how very niche is that club that we've tried,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.280]   we've created of language and linguistic type of systems
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.900]   that are very specific to our particular kinds of brains.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.320]   And we share ideas together.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.000]   We're all super excited that we can understand
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.340]   the universe 'cause we came up with some notation and math.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.440]   I wonder if there's some totally other kinds of language
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.480]   that communicates on a different timescale
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:58.160]   with very different mechanisms in the space of information
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.160]   that just is not, everything is lost in translation.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.760]   - Yeah, and it could well be.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.320]   So look, I mean, I think part of the reason
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:12.320]   I go toward the possibility of the soul intelligence
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.400]   is there's a certain kind of romantic appeal
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.820]   to looking out in the cosmos and it's just quiet
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.520]   and it's just eternal silence.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.320]   There's something that appeals to me
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.860]   at an emotional level that way.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:31.680]   But yeah, I mean, nobody knows.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.500]   And it's certainly conceivable
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.660]   that there's just a radical mismatch
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:40.060]   between the kinds of things
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.860]   that we are able to observe and sensitive to
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.200]   versus the kinds of structures that permeate the universe
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.400]   in a manner that simply we're unable to detect.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.000]   - Well, if we are alone, that is exciting.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.560]   And one of the ways it's exciting
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.560]   is that it's up to us to expand out into the universe,
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:07.760]   to permeate consciousness out into the universe.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.960]   So that's where space exploration comes in.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.440]   Let me ask you, as somebody who's a screen theorist,
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:17.120]   a physicist, do you think space exploration,
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.440]   colonizing space is a physics or an engineering problem?
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.280]   What would you say?
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.440]   - Yeah, I think it's fundamentally an engineering problem
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   if we're not trying to do things like build wormholes
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.000]   the way they did, say, an interstellar
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.240]   to get to a different place
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.920]   or trying to travel near the speed of light
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.420]   so that we would actually be able
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.140]   to traverse interstellar distances.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:44.680]   I mean, without that, our colonization will happen
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.160]   in a very, very slow rate, right?
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:51.400]   But one of the beauties of relativity
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.880]   is if you do travel near the speed of light,
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.040]   you can actually go arbitrarily far in a human lifetime.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.120]   People say, how's that possible?
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.160]   You can't go billions of light years.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.720]   Well, you can actually,
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.440]   because as you can do the speed of light,
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.080]   the way in which space and time change
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.640]   allows you to go, in principle, arbitrarily far.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.940]   That's very exciting.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:13.640]   But if we put that physics side of the issue
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.960]   and the manipulation of space and time to the side,
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.200]   yeah, I think it's a deep engineering problem.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.660]   You know, how do you terraform other planets?
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:26.660]   I mean, how do you go beyond our local neighborhood,
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:30.360]   say, without using the ideas of relativity?
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.080]   So I think it's all quite exciting.
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.920]   And I think the idea is using solar sails
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.680]   that people have developed
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.780]   and trying to take that first step to Mars.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.020]   I think that's a vital and valuable step to take.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.380]   But yeah, I think these are fundamentally
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.380]   engineering challenges.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.500]   - Or extending the human lifespan through biology research
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:54.500]   or maybe reducing what it means to be a human being
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.740]   into information and uploading certain parts of it.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:00.940]   Maybe not all the full resolution of a human life,
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:03.940]   but maybe the essential things like the DNA
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.140]   and be able to reconstruct that human being.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:11.500]   But, you know, I have to ask about Mars.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:16.500]   You know, do you find the dream of humans stepping on Mars,
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:20.800]   stepping foot first, but also colonizing Mars,
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.000]   one that's worth us fighting for?
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:25.960]   - Yeah, hugely so.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.480]   I mean, I think what we have long been
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.920]   not always in the best way is a species of explorers
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.040]   in the literal sense of traveling
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.560]   from one part of the world to another,
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.360]   or in the more metaphorical sense
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.140]   of trying to travel through our minds to the quantum realm
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:47.780]   or back to the Big Bang or to the center of black holes.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.460]   So I think that's fundamentally part of the human spirit.
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:56.460]   So I do think that's a vital part of our heritage
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:01.020]   brought forward into its next incarnation.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.000]   That's who we are.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.840]   - Do you think there'll be a day in the future
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:11.280]   where a human being is born on Mars
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:16.280]   and has to learn about his or her human origins on Earth?
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.360]   Like they'll have to read in a book?
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.960]   - Yeah, I don't think it'll be a book at that stage.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.460]   It'll probably just be uploaded into the head or something,
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.720]   or imprinted into the DNA,
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.400]   and then they just sort of sense it.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.040]   But yeah, I think there's, well, look,
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.840]   the issue you raised before is the vital one.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.540]   Is it the case that any sufficiently advanced civilization
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.920]   destroys itself?
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.360]   Is that sort of a commonplace quality?
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.960]   I mean, that's the other potential answer
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.640]   to the Fermi paradox.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.680]   Why aren't they here?
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.680]   Because by the time they got to the technological development
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.760]   where they could travel here, they blew themselves up.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.000]   They destroyed themselves.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.600]   And that's an unfortunate,
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:58.680]   but not a hard to imagine possibility
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:02.600]   based on things that have happened here on planet Earth.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.840]   But putting that to the side, I think it,
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.100]   you know, that's the big obstacle,
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.120]   but putting it to the side,
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.720]   we will resolve the engineering challenges.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:14.340]   And, you know, I should probably modify my answer
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.020]   from before when you said, is it engineering or physics?
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.480]   It's really both, right?
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.520]   So we will surmount the engineering challenges,
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.760]   and that will then make the physics challenges relevant.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.180]   It'll make it relevant to figure out
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.040]   how to travel near the speed of light.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.480]   It'll make it relevant to learn how to manipulate
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.320]   the shape of space-time and so forth.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.860]   So I think it's a multi-stage process
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.320]   where it is engineering and ultimately physics.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.560]   And if we stick around long enough,
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.720]   those are the kinds of challenges
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.720]   I think that we're ultimately gonna surmount.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:45.780]   - And on the physics side,
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.880]   it's figuring out how to harness energy enough
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.920]   to travel outside the solar system,
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.340]   which seems like a heck of a difficult journey.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:56.140]   But even Mars itself, I don't know,
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.600]   maybe because I was born in the Soviet Union
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.480]   and was born with the, you know,
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.840]   looking up at the stars and that dream
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.880]   of like the highest of human achievement
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.480]   is the ability to fly out there,
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.040]   to, you know, to join the stars.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.840]   I really like the idea of going to Mars
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:17.200]   and not just stepping foot on Mars.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.200]   It wasn't until, maybe I'm misinformed,
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.060]   but for me personally, it wasn't until Elon Musk
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.940]   started talking about the colonization of Mars
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:34.940]   did I realize like we humans can actually do that.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.380]   And first of all, the importance of somebody saying
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:42.820]   that we can do these seemingly impossible things
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.620]   is immeasurable because, you know,
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.140]   the fact that he placed that into my mind
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.180]   and into the minds of millions of others,
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:54.860]   maybe hundreds of millions, maybe billions of others,
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:58.660]   young kids today, I mean, that's gonna make it a reality.
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:00.900]   I, for some reason, am deeply excited,
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:06.260]   even though my work is in AI, that echoes all of this.
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.500]   I'm excited by the idea that somebody would be born,
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:14.180]   as we were saying, on Mars and sort of look up
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.660]   and be able to see with a telescope Earth
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.360]   and say, "That's where I came from."
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:23.540]   I don't know, that idea scale to other planets,
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.580]   to other solar systems, that's really exciting.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.020]   - And hugely exciting.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.300]   I think you're absolutely right.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:33.820]   I mean, the vital thing is to dream, right?
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:36.380]   I mean, and it sounds hackneyed,
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:40.340]   but it is so important for young kids
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.620]   for the next generation to think about the things
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.460]   that are seemingly impossible.
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:47.140]   I mean, that's what makes them possible.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.280]   And this is one which is concrete enough.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.120]   I mean, this is something that's gonna happen soon
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.840]   in terms of actually going to Mars.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.840]   And then the next step of establishing some presence,
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.600]   some semi-permanent or permanent presence,
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.480]   this is not something that's gonna wait
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.560]   to the 25th century.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.720]   I mean, this is something that's gonna happen
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.140]   relatively soon.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.200]   So, I mean, it could well be in your lifetime,
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.640]   unlikely mine, but possibly in your lifetime,
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.120]   that that kid will be born and have the experience
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.280]   that you described.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.760]   So, yeah, it's spectacularly exciting.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.240]   - And I actually, I would love to go on Mars
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.880]   on one of the early-
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.720]   - You would? - Yeah.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.160]   - What if it's one way?
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.120]   - I'm happy doing one way.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.480]   - Really? Wow.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.480]   - And I'm single if there's ladies out there
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.520]   that wanna start that family.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.520]   Let's go out to Mars.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:37.360]   No, I think-
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.480]   - See, I have to tell you something.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.680]   You spoke about terror, thinking about like black holes.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.400]   If I actually think about going to Mars
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:49.720]   and being on Mars and put myself in there fully,
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.760]   that's terror-inducing.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.920]   The idea of to be in this foreign world
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.700]   where you can't come back,
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:00.000]   where you've made this choice that can't be reversed,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.600]   or at some point, it may be, but in that guise,
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.160]   that to me carries a deep sense of terror.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.600]   - You know, I feel that sense of terror every time.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.840]   Kerouac, Jack Kerouac talked about this on the road,
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.400]   is when you leave a place, if you're honest about it,
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.800]   like life is short.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.080]   And when you leave a place, you move to a new place,
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.180]   and you think of all the friends, maybe family,
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:28.020]   you're leaving behind as you drive over the hill,
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:31.480]   that really is goodbye.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.300]   Like we sometimes don't think of it that way
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.280]   when we're moving, but that really is goodbye to that life,
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.660]   to the person you were, to all the people.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.280]   Maybe if it's close friends,
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.840]   you'll see them maybe 10, 15 more times in your life,
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.840]   and that's it.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.120]   And you're saying goodbye to all of that.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.200]   And so in the same way, I see it as way more dramatic
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.120]   when you're flying away from Earth,
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:56.200]   and it's like, it's goodbye to Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks,
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.680]   and it's goodbye to whatever,
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.660]   I don't know why I picked those,
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:04.660]   but all the things that are special to Earth, it's goodbye.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.920]   But that's life.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.680]   I suppose more what excites me about that kind of journey
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.800]   is it's a distinct contemplation of your mortality,
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.680]   acceptance of your mortality.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.620]   You're saying just like when you take on
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.840]   any difficult journey, it's accepting
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.200]   that you're going to die one day,
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.760]   and might as well do something truly exciting.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.560]   - Yes, I mean, I'm with you on that.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.640]   I'm a strong believer that deep underneath
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.640]   human motivation is this terror of our own mortality.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.600]   There's this wonderful book that had a great influence
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.560]   on me called "The Denial of Death" by Ernest Becker.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.320]   And when you are aware of the ways
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   in which our mortality influences our behaviors,
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.720]   it really does add a different slant,
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.000]   a different kind of color
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.640]   to the interpretation of human behavior.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:07.600]   - Yeah, it's funny, that book had a big influence
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.440]   on me as well.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440]   - Oh, is that right?
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.000]   - And terror management theory.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.880]   And I, again, from an engineering perspective,
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.380]   I don't know how many people that book influenced,
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:22.040]   because I talked to people about the fear of death,
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.960]   and it doesn't seem to be that fundamental
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:26.560]   to their experience.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.200]   And I don't think on the surface
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.560]   it's fundamental to my experience,
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.720]   but it seems like an awfully,
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.160]   in terms of we're talking about models
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.480]   and strength theory and theories,
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.360]   in terms of theories of this macro experience
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.920]   of human life, it seems like a heck of a good theory
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.760]   that the fear of death is the warm at the core.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.320]   - Yeah, well, I mean, and the terror management theory
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.460]   is that you make reference to.
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:52.580]   I mean, this is a group of psychologists,
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.440]   social psychologists who devised
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.400]   these very clever experiments,
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.760]   real-world experiments with real people,
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.120]   where you can directly measure the hidden influence
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.520]   of the recognition of our own mortality.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.640]   I mean, they've done these experiments
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.640]   where they have group of people A, group of people B,
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.000]   and the only difference between the two groups
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.240]   is that group B, they somehow reminded them
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.140]   in some subtle way of their own mortality.
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.260]   Sometimes it's nothing more than interviewing them
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.780]   with a funeral home across the street.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.880]   You know, an influence is there, but it's subtle.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.560]   You don't even think you'd take note of.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.280]   And they can find measurable effects
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.760]   that differentiate the two groups to a high degree
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.780]   of statistical significance in how they respond
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:40.840]   to certain challenges or certain kinds of questions
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.840]   that shows a direct influence of the reminder
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.040]   of their own mortality.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.700]   And I've read a number of these studies,
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:51.720]   and they are really convincing.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.140]   And so, yeah, I would say that the reason why
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.360]   so many people would say that, yeah,
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.200]   fear of mortality's not front and center in my worldview,
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.440]   yeah, I don't really think about it much,
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.360]   doesn't really matter to me much.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.160]   The reason why they're able to say that
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.600]   is because this thing called culture has emerged
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.840]   over the course of the last 10,000 years.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.360]   And part of the role of culture is to give us a means
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.120]   of not thinking about our mortality all the time,
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.080]   of not living in terror of the inevitable end
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.840]   which faces us all.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.600]   So it's completely understandable that that's the response
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.960]   because that's what culture is at least in part for.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:32.360]   - Is it at least possible that the fear of death,
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.360]   the terror of your mortality is the creative force
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.080]   that created all of the things around us
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.600]   at this human civilization?
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.880]   And I think about from an engineering perspective,
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.280]   this is where I lose all of my robotics colleagues
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.600]   is I feel like if you want to create intelligence,
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.600]   you have to also engineer in some kind of echo
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.760]   of this kind of fear.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.440]   And fear is such a complicated word,
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.440]   but kind of like a scarcity, a scarcity of time,
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.520]   a scarcity of resources that creates a kind of anxiety,
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.480]   like deadlines get you to do stuff.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   And there's something almost fundamental to that
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.480]   in terms of human experience.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.720]   - Yeah, well, that's an interesting thought.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   So you're basically in order to create a kind of structure
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:34.360]   that mirrors what we call consciousness,
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.800]   you'd better have that structure confront
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:42.040]   the same kinds of issues and terrors that we do.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.240]   - Consciousness and suffering only makes sense
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.680]   in the context of death.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:48.920]   If you want to, I feel like if you want to fit
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.400]   into human society, if you're a robot
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.520]   and if you want to fit into human society,
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.160]   you better have the same kind of existential dread,
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.800]   the same kind of fear of mortality,
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.200]   otherwise you're not gonna fit in.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.040]   - Right.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.240]   (both laughing)
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.360]   - It might be wild, but it's at least like we're talking
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.760]   about all the theories that are at least worth consideration.
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.800]   I think that's a really powerful one.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.240]   And definitely one has resonated with me
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:24.240]   and definitely seems to capture something beautifully,
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:31.320]   like real about the human condition.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.120]   And I wonder, it's of course sucks to think
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.220]   that we need death to appreciate life,
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:43.160]   but that just may be the way it is.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.480]   - Well, it's interesting if this robotic
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:49.480]   or artificially intelligent system understands the world
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:51.720]   and understands the second law of thermodynamics
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.760]   and entropy, even an artificial intelligence
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.280]   will realize that even if its parts are really robust,
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.720]   ultimately it will disintegrate.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:05.240]   I mean, so the timescales may be different,
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.040]   but in a way when you think about it, it doesn't matter.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.800]   Once you know that you are mortal in the sense
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.760]   that you are not eternal, the timescale hardly matters
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.960]   because it's either the whole thing or not.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.760]   Because on the scales of eternity,
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.720]   any finite duration, however large is effectively zero
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.600]   on the scales of eternity.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:28.840]   And so maybe it won't be so hard for an artificial system
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.040]   to feel that sense of mortality
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.240]   because it will recognize the underlying physical laws
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.720]   and recognize its own finitude.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.360]   - And then it'll be us and robots drinking beers,
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.360]   looking up at the stars and just, you know,
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.120]   having a good laugh in awe of the whole thing.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:51.960]   - Yeah.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.520]   - I think that's a pretty good way to end it,
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.360]   talking about the fear of death.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.840]   We started talking about the meaning of life
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.100]   and ended on the fear of death.
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:02.720]   Brian, this was an incredible conversation.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.400]   - My pleasure, thank you, I enjoyed it enormously.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.240]   - I really, really enjoyed it.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.760]   It's been a long time coming.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:09.760]   I'm a huge fan of your work, a huge fan of your writing.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.760]   Thanks for talking to me, Brian.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:12.080]   - Thank you.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.560]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.780]   with Brian Green.
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.120]   To support this podcast,
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.880]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.000]   And now let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.580]   Physics is really nothing more
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.940]   than a search for ultimate simplicity,
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   but so far all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.840]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:41.000]   (upbeat music)
