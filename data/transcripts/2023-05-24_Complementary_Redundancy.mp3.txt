[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   When you're in winter's favorite town,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   the snow-covered mountains surround you,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   a historic main street charms you,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and every day brings a new adventure.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Welcome to Park City, Utah. Naturally, winter's favorite town.

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host, and
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   today I want to share with you about a very
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   useful planning concept. A heuristic
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   that you can implement to not only get
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   better outcomes, but more importantly, to make you a better
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   planner in all parts of your life.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That concept is
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   complementary redundancy. Let me expand.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We begin with a simple saying. That saying
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   is this, "Two is one, and one
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   is none." I'm not sure who originated this. I've heard it
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   most in the world of physical prepping, preparedness, planning, etc.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Perhaps it came from the military, I don't know. But the basic idea
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   is two is one, and one is none. What it means
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   is if you have one of something, and that something
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   fails, then you have nothing.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But if you have two of something, and something fails, then you have one.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   An example would be, let's say you're out on a hike, and you know of course
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   that water is very important so that you can stay hydrated and stay alive,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   yet you shouldn't just kneel down and drink the water from the stream.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So you need some form of a water filter or water purifier.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So if you take on your hike a water filter,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and that's all that you have. You have one water filter,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and then that water filter gets a hole in the membrane and it stops functioning,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   well, you now have no way to filter water.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Which can result in you being very sick, and potentially it's a life-threatening
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   disease if you get very sick because you drank unfiltered water.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So to implement two is one, and one is none,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   you would recognize that because this is a mission-critical piece of gear,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I need to be able to filter water, you would bring some kind of
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   backup. You would have a backup plan. And so you could carry
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   two water filters, or you could have a water filter
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and an extra cartridge for your water filter. Or you could
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   be hiking with a friend of yours that also carries a water filter.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Or you could bring a backup of some water purification
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   tablets, so that if your water filter fails, then at least
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   you can purify the water by using some water purification tablets
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and you won't get so sick. So two is one, and one
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   is none. If you always commit yourself to having two
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   of mission-critical gear, then
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   if one fails, you'll still have one left. Now bear with me,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'm going somewhere and I'm going to spend most of my time on financial planning, but this concept
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   is easiest for me to articulate and teach about in the context of
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   physical preparedness. Over the years, people have played
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   with this saying a little bit, and they've added more numbers. Preppers
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   especially want to collect huge amounts of
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   gear, etc. And so you'll have a guy go through his backpack and he has 18
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   flashlights in there and four knives, and you're like, "Dude, come on,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   this is really necessary." But people have played with it, and my favorite
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   saying of this particular phrase is this,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "Two is one, one is none, three is
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   a guarantee." Two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And that's the one that I personally use in my own life.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   If there's something that's very important to me, there's something that I
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   need to do that's very important, something I need to have, a capability,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   whatever the version of it is, if there's something that's very important to me,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   then I say, "Two is one, one is none, and three
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   is a guarantee." I want to make sure that I always have three
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   different ways to accomplish something. So back to the example
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   of our hiker who's out wandering in the woods. That hiker
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   might carry his water filter, he might carry some water purification
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   tablets, and he might also carry a stainless steel cup
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   or a single-walled stainless steel water bottle, as well as
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   some fire-making equipment, so that if he runs out of
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   water purification tablets, and if his filter is broken, at the very least
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   he can gather wood, start a fire, and boil water, thus rendering
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   it safe to drink. So two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's very difficult to describe a scenario
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   that could happen in which our intrepid hiker would not be able
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   with three methods of cleaning his water, would not be able to have
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   clean water to drink. Two is one, one is none,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   and three is a guarantee. So if there's something that's important
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   to you, always have triple redundancy, and in
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   virtually all cases, you will not only have, you're going to be
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   able to accomplish that task. Now, let's go a step further
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   because I've actually accidentally already gotten to the topic
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   of complementary redundancy. So far, I've been focusing
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   on the number of redundant methods of accomplishing something.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee, three different ways of doing something.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   But where does the complementary come into the
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   redundancy? And it has to do with thinking about ways
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   that you can accomplish and have different methods and tactics
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   that give you different benefits but still perform
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   the same underlying core function. Let me use a
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   flashlight example because where I first learned this
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   particular concept, or first had it fleshed out the way that I
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   like and have used it now for years, is from a YouTube channel called
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Urban Prepper. And on that YouTube channel, Cliff, the Urban Prepper, he
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   talked about complementary redundancy and he gave a flashlight example.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Many people understand that having a source of light
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and illumination is very useful and it's something that you want to
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   have. And so we recognize that and we want to have a flashlight.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So if you live in hurricane country and you're planning about hurricane preparedness,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   they say have a flashlight and batteries. If you live in snow country and you're planning for emergency preparedness,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   have a flashlight and batteries. So you can have a flashlight and batteries. And sometimes
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   some preppers go out and they have a flashlight in every room, a flashlight in every drawer,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   but they're all flashlights. And you say, this seems a little wasteful.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   After all, what's the point of having three different flashlights that all do the same thing?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Is there a way that I can get more benefit while also having redundancy?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And the way that you do that is you analyze what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   In the flashlight example, you're trying to gain
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   a source of illumination. And then you think about different types of
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   illumination or different features or attributes of illumination
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   that you might want to have. So flashlights, for example,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   are really great at throwing light, but sometimes they're hard to hold.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And so a form of complementary redundancy would be to have one
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   handheld flashlight that is in your pack or in your kit
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   or on your person. And then to complement that with something like a headlamp.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   A small headlamp that has a little cord around it so that if you need to work on something
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   hands-free, you're cooking over a fire or you're fixing something on your car,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   you need both of your hands to turn a wrench, then you can put on that headlamp.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   That gives you not only a redundant source of light, because of course
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   you can use the headlamp to light your path or shine underneath a couch
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   while you're looking for your child's lost toy or whatever it is. It works just
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   fine in that perspective. And you can always hand-hold a headlamp,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   but it gives you a complementary redundancy because now
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   you have your handheld source of light and you have your
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   head-mounted source of light. So you have a backup source
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   of illumination, but it gives you different benefits and features.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And then what if we wanted to have three? What if two is one, one is none
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and three is for me? Three is a guarantee. Three is for me.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Well, then we would say, "What other kinds of illumination
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   would we like to have?" And so we might do something like have a lantern.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Because a lantern gives a pleasant form of
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   area lighting. And so if the power goes out and your family is gathered around the dinner
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   table because you were in the middle of eating dinner when it happened, then a flashlight
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   isn't great, a headlamp isn't great. Of course you can play with those and modify them. You can
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   shine them through a bottle of water or something to turn them into a
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   quasi-lantern. But it's nicer if you simply have a lantern.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And a lantern can work as a reliable backup source of light.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   If you need to fix something hands-free, the lantern can work. If you need to shine a light
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   around a room, the lantern can work. But it gives you a very pleasant form of
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   complementary redundancy. That's the basic concept of
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   complementary redundancy. Now, back to our hiker.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I accidentally, when I started the example, I actually already accidentally
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   did that because that's the way that my brain works. If you notice my
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   three methods of purifying water that I discussed,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   they provide the hiker with complementary redundancy. What's the
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   complement? Well, first, the water filter
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   is his primary source or primary method of
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   cleansing his water so that he can drink it. And the water filter is ideal
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   because it's fast, it's easy, and it renders the water
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   not only safe to drink, but nice tasting. He can get the impurities
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   out and it can be a pleasant experience for him to have his drink of water. And so
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   that's his primary method. But that water filter suffers from being
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   silky and really only doing one thing, filtering water.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   The second method I talked about, that of water purification
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   tablets, is not ideal for him to use on a
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   regular basis. It's more appropriate as an emergency backup because
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   the water purification tablets not only aren't going to remove turbidity
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   from the water, not only are they not going to remove bad taste from the water,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   they're actually going to add an unpleasant taste to the water itself. They
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   simply make the water safe to drink, but they're not pleasant.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But what they are is small, compact, durable,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and hard to destroy. Unlike the water filter, where the membrane itself
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   might be delicate and cause problems, the
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   water tablets are small, they're compact, they're durable,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and they're not going to fail. If he's got them in a Ziploc bag and they're stuck in a safe place,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   they're not going to fail. They're going to be able to purify the water.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Now that brings us to our third method, the third method of having a
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   vessel in which he can boil the water. This is a good form
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   of complementary redundancy because it not only complements the other methods,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   so for example, if our hiker had to use his water
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   tablets, he would need to be able to put the water into a
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   vessel that he can then put the tablets in and let them sit.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And so what a hiker will usually do is will size his water
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   bottle that he's going to boil water in, or his pot, to the proper size of
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   how much water you can purify with one water purification tablet.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And so the vessel that he would boil water in complements
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   the other forms of purification. But it's redundant
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   because he could use just that method alone to provide
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   him with clean water. And again, it's not
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   an ideal system because
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   it's hard to make a fire, it's time consuming, the water's not going to taste
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   great, but it provides him with another bit of capacity because now
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   instead of just having a bottle that can be used to boil water in,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   he has a bottle that he can simply carry water in. And that water
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   that he's carrying doesn't need to be purified because he brings it from home. He may
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   not need to purify any or as much of his water from the streams.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And the other aspect is simply the fire itself can be
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   used on a daily basis to hydrate his hiking meals,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   etc. And so there's this virtuous circle among good gear and good
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   planning. There's this virtuous circle where if you think in terms of
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   complementary redundancy, you can implement different components
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   that give you the same basic function, but that
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   also give you various attributes that complement one another.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I hope it's useful and I hope you think about that.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And I like to use those preparedness examples, those physical examples, because
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   if you grasp them, they're simple and straightforward. And all this is is a
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   thinking tool. What you do is you apply this method of
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   thinking to anything that is important for you.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And you consider, what do I want to do? What is the
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   capability that I want to have? And what methods can I
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   put in place so that I have two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   So I have three methods to do those basic capabilities.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And then how can I create complementary redundancy
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   among these capabilities? By the way, this is really
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   only for very important items. This is really only
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   important for mission critical items or mission critical skills
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   or things that are very important to you. Having fresh,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   clean, safe water to drink is very important to me. And so
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I want to make sure that I have the three different options. On the other hand,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   if I have a shirt, I'm out hiking and the shirt doesn't smell
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   very good, I'm not going to try to always make sure that I have two is one, one is none,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   three is a guarantee, and complementary redundancy among my shirts. I'm just
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   going to be willing to deal with a stinky shirt on occasion. Now clearly, we'll bring in
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   layers to keep me warm, but I'm not going to carry three extra shirts and weigh myself
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   down just so I don't have a stinky shirt. There's a difference between things that are
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   truly important that you are not willing to do without versus things that
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   are nice to have and hey, a failure is okay.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Let's turn now to financial examples. What are some
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   ways of thinking and of applying this in the financial world?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I'm repeating, but this is what I do. This is one of the thinking tools I
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   use to try to give people good outcomes. If there's something that's important,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   then I want to have three different ways of accomplishing it. Let's start with the simplest
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   example, that of buying something. The most basic
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   use of money is the ability to go and purchase something
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   when you need it. I want to make sure that I always have multiple
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   ways of purchasing something. In my wallet, I always
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   may have a primary, but I'll go through the three.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   In my wallet, I'll always have cash. I always have physical cash so that I can
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   purchase something. I'll also always have a card, a credit card,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   debit card, etc. Something that I can use to purchase something with a card.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Then I'll always have an Apple Pay or a Google Pay, some form
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   of electronic redundancy that I can use to pay for something. Now you pick
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   your pick of which of those you prefer to be your primary form
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   of payment. Some people want cash as their primary form of payment. Some people their
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   cards. Some people their watch. I find all of them useful in different
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   contexts. I find that those three different methods of purchasing something
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   complement one another really, really beautifully.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   The first thing, cash. Cash gives me certain features and attributes.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Cash is
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   to make sure that I don't go into debt. It allows me to purchase something. It's easy to budget
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   because I can mentally account for it in a really reliable and consistent
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   way. Cash is virtually always accepted.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   It makes things happen very, very quickly. Cash is anonymous. I don't create a big profile
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   with all of my transactions. Cash is safe. Once I purchase
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   something with my cash, then
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   it's done. The seller is safe and I'm safe. The transaction is
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   finished and concluded. There's no fraud, etc. It's a wonderful tool.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Cash is great. On the other hand, cash has other attributes
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   that make it difficult to happen. I might want to carry a few hundred
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   dollars or a couple thousand dollars on me, but I for one am not carrying
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   tens of thousands of dollars in my wallet or on my person on a daily basis.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   You say, "I might like to be able to make larger transactions
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   than I would make with the money that I carry in my wallet."
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   That's where a complementary form of payment, such as a credit card,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   can give you access to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars of buying
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   power in a single transaction. It gives you the ability to
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   make large transactions. It is convenient
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   in its own way and in a different way. It is very safe because
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   now you have fraud protection, you have merchant protection on certain transactions,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   so it's convenient and safe. It's easy.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   It complements one another beautifully. You might always carry a few hundred dollars,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   but then your real spending money is on your credit card.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   You switch to something like Apple Pay on your watch. Now you have a whole different
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   set of features and attributes. You have the ability to spend
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   large amounts of money, but now you don't need to carry a wallet. You don't need to
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   carry cash. You don't need to carry a card. All you need is the watch on your wrist.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   You have additional purchasing safety because now, instead of all of your
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   personal information being spilled with your credit card, now it's a single
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   transaction through Apple Pay, which gives you additional forms
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   of protection on the purchase transaction. Now you have
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   the features such that you're at an all-inclusive resort playing
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   around in the pool, and for whatever reason you're not going to charge stuff directly to your
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   room, but you want to pay, but you don't want to carry cash, which is going to get wet. You don't want to carry cards
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   because it's annoying to have them in your pocket. Your watch is on your wrist. Tap, tap. Pay the bill.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   You're done. You have three different methods of paying things.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   What happens is that the three methods actually become more.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   You can have ten different credit cards and ten different currencies or ten different
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   cards from different countries or different banks, etc. all lined up right there
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   on your watch ready for you. At the simplest
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   perspective of buying something and you want to plan that
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee, with those three methods that I've
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   described, you're pretty much always going to be able to buy something.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   You could buy a car. Even if you have low credit limits, you just pull out your Apple Watch and go down
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   six cards and make six transactions and buy your car, and you're on
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   your way. Two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and I want complementary redundancy.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Complementary redundancy. Now, you go through other
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   areas. I think about this with regard to bank
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   accounts. When I think about planning out my banking
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   infrastructure, I know that two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   so I want to have at least three different bank accounts.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I don't want to just have three bank accounts all at the same kind of
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   bank. I don't want to have a bank account with Chase and
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Wells Fargo and Bank of America. What's the point? They're all the same.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I mean, yes, there is some point, meaning that I do have differentiation
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   among them, but what I mean is they all basically offer the same set of
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   products, and I want to build in complementary redundancy
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   into my banking situation. So what can I do? Well, I'm going to
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   try to have three banks, but I want to analyze the basic attributes
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and features of those banks and then incorporate
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   them into my financial life. So I might want to have
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   one bank account with a big monster mega bank in the United States because they have
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   a national presence and a national footprint. So again, Wells Fargo,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Chase, Bank of America, one of these is great,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and they have good services, they've got good products, they've got ATMs
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   and bank branches all around the country. I now have access to a national bank.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   But hopefully by my articulating the basic attributes
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   of this bank, you can see that there are times when I might want to have
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   the opposite of those attributes. So I want to follow that up perhaps with a small
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   local credit union or a small local bank. Why?
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Well, the big bank can be useful because it gives me
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   access to lots of services, but a little bank can be useful because
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I might get better personalized service, or I might get more privacy.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Someone's doing an asset search on me. Well, they're certainly going to try to get the
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   info out of the big monster mega banks, but are they really likely to find
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   my account at the local credit union in upstate Maine when I myself
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   live in Florida? That's unlikely. And so I'll have
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   an account with a local credit union, a small local
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   credit union that is going to give me access to their banking setups.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   In addition, these products can often complement one another. So the difference between
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   a bank, which is a for-profit entity, and a credit union,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   which is a not-for-profit entity run for the benefit of its members,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   means that now I'm going to have access to a different set of products
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   with a different set of features. At the big monster bank, I'm going to have access to all of their products,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   which are large, nationally advertised, etc. But at the local credit union,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I'm going to have access to lower cost of financing, better rates
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   and terms on certain financial products, more careful individualized
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   underwriting where I'm not just a number. I have something to offset that.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Now, where does the third one come in? Well, the third one comes in
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   where in my analysis, I try to think of what are features and attributes
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   that I might desire to have in a bank that I'm not going to have
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   with options one and two. And so in my mind, I immediately
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   of course go to, well, we don't have to immediately go offshore. That's where my mind
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   goes. But I would look then at different levels of banking. Maybe you're
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   very wealthy. And so you want to go ahead and have a relationship with a
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   private bank, someone that's going to give you a very high level of service
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and this can offset your other relationships. I quickly go offshore.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   So I say, I've got a good bank account in the United States with a big
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   national bank. I've got a good bank account in the United States with
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   a local credit union. The common feature of these though is the United States
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and the US dollar. So maybe now I open up one bank
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   account outside of the United States so that not everything is
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   governed by one country's laws and rules and not everything
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   is in one currency. And I might diversify and have access
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   to a second currency by features
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   of my having this international bank account. Now, quickly
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   you can see that you can go on this way forever and only you
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   are going to be able to decide where the right place to stop is. So you might
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   say, I want to have a bank account abroad but I don't want just one
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   bank account abroad. I want three bank accounts abroad in three different countries with
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   three different currencies. Okay, that's fine. There's just a sliding
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   scale here with how important something is to you and what the
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   cost is to maintain that setup. If it's very important
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   to you to have a flashlight, then you'll carry a flashlight with
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   you. But one person is going to say, two is one, one is none, three is a
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   guarantee. And he's going to have a flashlight, a cell phone with a flashlight
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   in it, and a watch with a flashlight in it and say that's good enough for me.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Another person is going to have a flashlight,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   a headlamp, and a lantern, and a cell phone, and a watch
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   because I'm going to have this and I want these features and I'm willing to carry this extra weight
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   in my bag. One person is going to have three bank accounts
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that are all in the United States. Another person is going to have three bank accounts in the United States,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   three bank accounts outside the United States, and three more backups in
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   wherever. So this is just a mental tool and you have
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   to decide what you want and how important it is for you. But if you think about this
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   in your various aspects of financial planning, you will
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   be a better planner. Before I
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   go on and give more examples, I want to explain to you one of the things I most value about this
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   method of thinking. What it forces you to do, done properly, is
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   it forces you to be a better planner and a better thinker
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   because you have to examine and identify the fundamental attributes
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   of a thing or of a solution. And you have
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   to identify those attributes and how they compare
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   to the attributes of another thing or another solution.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So in terms of banking, very few people have ever thought much about
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   what they desire in a bank account. They just saw an advertisement for a bank and they went
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and opened a bank account. But if you think about it and you recognize
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   that there are certain attributes of each bank and these are
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   kind of built-in, baked-in attributes, then you can say, "Do I want those
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   attributes? Do I not want those attributes?" and you can incorporate them in a more self-conscious
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   manner. This
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   skill of not being caught up in emotionalism, not being caught
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   up in dogmatic thinking, but rather in simply assessing
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   something, identifying its basic attributes, and thinking about where those attributes
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   might be useful to you is something that will make you
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   a better thinker and a better planner. Let's use
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   an example such as investing.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   If we go to the world of investing and we say
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee, and we think about
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   complementary redundancy, then
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   in this conversation we want to think about how
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   can I get different features for my investments?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   One guy might go out and say, "Your business
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   is your best investment." I would be that guy, by the way. "Your business is your best
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   investment." And you might hear that and think that I'm saying, "You should
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   only invest in your business." That would be false. Your business is your
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   best investment. It has the most potential, the most opportunity
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   to make you the highest return on your money, and that's the key metric
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   for you to be shooting towards. It also has certain basic attributes, such as
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   control. You can control the investment. Such as insider information.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   When you're investing in your own business, you have insider information, and it's
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   entirely legal for you to invest according to that information.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   You have the ability to access capital, to borrow money safely.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   You have all kinds of basic features with your own business. But then you have a whole
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   giant set of drawbacks. What if you get sick and can't run your business? The whole thing
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   collapses. Your business is highly concentrated in a single industry
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   or a single thing, and that may cause everything to fall apart.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And so, by recognizing that, now you say, "You know what?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I'd like to have some redundancy, but I want it to be complimentary."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   So if I have this business, and I want redundancy,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I want another way of making a lot of money on my investing, but
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I want it to complement the business, then let me take all of the attributes
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   of my business and flip them on their head and see if I can go and find
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   those attributes. So my business is very
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   highly concentrated into one industry or market segment.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   But now, let me go and find a way to invest into business that's not
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   concentrated into one market segment. Oh, if I buy this mutual fund, I have access
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   to lots of different segments. My business gives me insider information.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   But that means that I myself could make mistakes and screw things up.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   So let me buy businesses that are owned and managed by
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   other professionals so that I'm not the only one that's there.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And you say, "My business allows me to borrow a lot of money, but let me
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   make sure that I have money that's safe from borrowing." So instead of going out and
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   building a portfolio of risky, high-growth
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   stocks with margin accounts and a stock portfolio, let me go and buy mutual
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   funds and put them in a retirement account and never borrow against them. So at least if I go bankrupt
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   in my primary business, I have these backup investment assets here that I can
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   use to start over again. Well, two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Where's my third source of investing? Well, this is where we pivot often
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   to another form of investing, such as real estate.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   What's the benefit of real estate? Well, it's physical, it's tangible, it's functional,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   it has a certain form of utility. And so you might say, "My
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   three-pronged strategy is to invest primarily in my business, to
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   then complement that with investments in my mutual funds, in
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   retirement accounts, and then my complement to that is to invest
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   into a large, nice, personal home for me to live in so that
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   if point one and point two failed, I would at least have the money from my home
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   and the equity there that's available for me." Some guys might go out and
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   buy rental properties because now I have a source of income that's not
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   connected to sources of income number one and number two.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   You might diversify in other ways, right? You might go international, you might go across industries,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   etc. You're the one who gets to choose. But along the way, this way of
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   thinking, two is one, one is none, three is a guarantee, and looking for ways
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   to get that guarantee and also get complementary
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   redundancy is really, really powerful.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Now, you can apply this in any area
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   of your life, and I don't want to belabor the plan. I do this with
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   my emergency fund. If I need money, where is it going to come from?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   My emergency fund, three different forms of complementary redundancy. I might
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   have cash in my pocket or cash under my mattress. I might have a
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   credit card, and I might have a savings account, or I might plan
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   that I'm going to have cash, a savings account, and a loan against my
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   401(k) or a loan against my life insurance cash values, etc.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And those are three different forms of access to capital
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   that are going to allow you to solve the emergency, and they're different.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   They're unique in each one of them. You might have,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I do this with international planning. I want to have three different countries that I can
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   live in, and those countries I want access to different
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   things. One country I want to make sure has access
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   to a large job market so I can make a good living. The second
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   country I want access to a low cost of living country. Job market
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   might stink, but maybe I'm working online, but I want a low cost of living place.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And then the third country might be a country that grows a lot of food
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   so I can be confident that I'm always going to have food to eat. The third
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   country might be a country that offers me access to a great healthcare system
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   so that if I'm dying of cancer I can get appropriate healthcare. I've used that
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   principle in setting up residencies, which was what I was talking about there. We could switch to
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   citizenships and passports. I want to have one
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   passport from a country that gives me access to
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   good travel access around the world. It allows me to travel to many
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   different countries without having to spend all my time in international embassies and consulates
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   applying for visas. So one factor in my passport
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   selection and the citizenships that I'm pursuing is going to be a powerful
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   travel document. Now on the flip side, that powerful travel document
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   often comes with a country that is going to impose high taxes,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   is going to be large, search for a lot of information, etc.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And so the second passport or citizenship that I pursue, I might
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   look for a small country. A small country that doesn't have a giant government spying
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   budget. They're not going to follow me around the world, and I just want to make sure that it's good enough, but it gives
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   me access to travel, but it's
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   from a small country that's fairly neutral. And then for the third
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   one, maybe I'll choose a country that has a totally different
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   profile than the one that I was, than either
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   country number one and country number two. So if country number one is the United
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   States, and the United States is the world's superpower, but it's going up
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   against China or Russia, then maybe there's a way that I can get
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   a citizenship from a country that is more friendly towards China and Russia and less
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   friendly to the United States. So that way, if my home country
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   is messing everything up and I want a balance and I want to be identified with
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   a different profile, then now I have the option to do that. So
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   you can apply this thinking in everything, in every aspect
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   of your life and every aspect of your life and planning. You identify
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   the goal that you have, the thing that you're trying to accomplish, the basic
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   features that you want. You think about how you can develop three different
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   ways to accomplish it, and then you look to make sure that those three different
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   methods or tools complement one another. So you don't
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   only have redundancy, but you have complementary
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   redundancy. I'm going to stop the examples there. I think you can fill them in. I had some other
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   things planned on credit cards and insurance, etc., but you've got the idea.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   You take it and go from here. As I wind down the show, though, I want to take a moment and promote
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   one of my classes that will give you good, solid application
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   of this principle to real life. And that class is called
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   International Escape Plan. You can buy it at
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   internationalescapeplan.com. I spent years thinking about these problems,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   watching them, etc., and as I thought about ways of preparing in the past, I've taught
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   classes on physical prepping, on preparedness, I've done all kinds of things on this.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I realized that there were a whole suite of solutions to problems
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   that most people weren't thinking of. And I realized that one of the best ways
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   to survive and thrive in any kind of crisis
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   was by not being where the crisis is happening, by simply going somewhere else.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And in today's world, you can look around and you can see many reasons why there could
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   be potential crisis in your town, in your neighborhood, in your country.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And so I want to teach people how to have a backup plan to be able to
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   escape to another country. So I created a course called
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   internationalescapeplan.com. And in that course, I teach you
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   how to put in place a system of complementary redundancy in
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   every aspect of your life. And I teach it in a very careful way,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   a very phased, tiered approach. I don't believe that everybody should go and be
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   immigrants to another country. Probably not going to solve your problems.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I don't think that everybody should leave and set up five bunkers
