[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:10.320]   Happy New Year, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.600]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel all while
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.200]   spending less and saving more.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.160]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to kick the New
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.600]   Year off talking about setting and achieving audacious goals in
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.240]   our lives.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.200]   And who better to join me for that than Ben Nimpton.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   If you don't recognize Ben by name, you might recognize the
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   MTV show he created back in 2006, The Buried Life, where he
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.640]   and three childhood friends created the world's greatest
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.480]   bucket list, borrowed a rickety old RV and crisscrossed North
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.040]   America chasing their dreams.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.760]   And while there were a few standard items on the list, like
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.480]   grow a mustache and learn to meditate, they had some
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.600]   ambitious goals like playing basketball with Obama, and
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.080]   having a beer with Prince Harry.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.880]   And every time they accomplished one of these dreams, they helped
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.920]   a complete stranger cross something off their list, which
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.320]   led them to reunite a father and son after 17 years and surprise
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.520]   a young girl with a much needed bionic arm.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.240]   Ben is also the author of the number one New York Times
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.320]   bestselling book, What Do You Want to Do Before You Die?
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.600]   Moving unexpected and inspiring answers to life's most important
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.120]   question, and now his second book, The Bucket List Journal is
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.120]   out this month.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.960]   It's a tool designed to help you create and achieve your goals.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.480]   Throughout his journey, Ben has had a mission to inspire others
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.800]   to live a life of fulfillment.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.560]   I couldn't be more excited for this conversation.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.400]   So without further ado, I hope you enjoy this chat with Ben
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.880]   Nempton.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.640]   Ben, thank you for being here.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.000]   Thanks, Chris.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.560]   Yeah, it's super exciting to be here.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.240]   So I last looked at the list that you created more than a
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.040]   decade ago.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   It's not done.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200]   Are you still trying to check everything off?
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah, so I think we've done out of that original list, 96 of
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   100.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.680]   Number 100 is Go to Space.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.520]   So that would be a good one to get off the list.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.960]   You know, we started Buried Life back in 2006.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.560]   It originally was a documentary, and we just started as a summer
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.960]   project to make a documentary to show our friends, but the
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.200]   adventure just continued to unravel.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.480]   So Make a Movie is still on the list.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.320]   We haven't finished the documentary.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   I think Go to Space could be the last piece of that puzzle.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.800]   And then put out the documentary.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.200]   But the thing is, I think the first, that original 100 is
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.040]   almost ceremonial at this point, because I've added so many more
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.760]   things to the list.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.120]   And I think that as you grow, your hopes and dreams and your
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   goals grow with you.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.120]   And so it's important to continue to add to your list to
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.760]   make sure it reflects what you truly want to do and who you
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.240]   truly are.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.400]   So but yeah, the original 196 of 100 have been completed.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.520]   That's impressive.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   What was the kind of hardest or most impressive thing on the
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.880]   list?
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.120]   So you'd mentioned play basketball with President Obama.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.400]   So that definitely comes to mind, because when we originally
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.480]   wrote that down, it almost was a joke.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.960]   It was the most impossible thing we could think of doing.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.880]   I mean, growing up in Victoria, BC, which is an island in
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.720]   Canada, the idea of playing basketball with the president
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.600]   was just it was almost laughable.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.200]   Like, it was so ambitious.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.880]   And it took about three years, but we found ourselves at the
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.160]   White House on the basketball course.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.840]   And President Obama actually surprised us on the basketball
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.320]   course, we didn't think he was in town, it we got about 100
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.120]   no's to get to the point where we got invited to do a tour of
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.840]   the White House.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   And he walked on the court and we were completely taken aback.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.400]   I mean, it was it was such a journey to get there.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.960]   But that was, I think, the most meaningful because I just
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   remember writing it down and thinking, this is never going
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.200]   to happen.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.960]   And and then I just saw it with my own eyes.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.760]   And I was like, wow, I guess these things that you think are
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.600]   impossible can actually happen.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.400]   Yeah, I mean, I similarly track a bucket list and my impossible
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.560]   thing was meet the president.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.800]   I didn't go as far as to have a goal of doing something.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.000]   I think that makes it even harder.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400]   But a friend of mine worked in the White House.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.640]   And it turns out when the Obama or any president is in town, the
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.440]   people who drive all the vans and the motorcade are just local
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   volunteers.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.560]   So I got they put me on the list.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.960]   And I was a volunteer one day, my wife and I each drove a van.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.640]   And at the end, you know, Obama came out and thanked everyone
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.760]   and said hi and shook hands and took photos.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.840]   And so I agree that that's a wild one.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.280]   If I played basketball would have blown my mind.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   So that's awesome.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.960]   Is there something on the list that nobody ever really asked
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   about because it's not as crazy as playing basketball with the
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.360]   president, but you wish people asked you about because it's
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.320]   such a great story.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.480]   One of the things that we that we had always wanted to do was
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.320]   this kind of is I laugh about thinking back, but it was it was
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.800]   ask out the girl of your dreams.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.280]   And at the time, this is right when Transformers had come out.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.640]   And so Megan Fox was the girl that I was like, that is the
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.320]   the woman that I need to ask.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.640]   And we had no way to get to her.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.440]   But we knew that the premiere of Transformers was happening in
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.120]   Los Angeles.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   And so we basically went to the premiere, I dressed up as a
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.400]   reporter and I put on a red jacket and I had a microphone
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.840]   and I didn't the microphone was tucked into my pocket.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.760]   And I had a friend who brought a camera and we were able to get
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.400]   our hands on a on a pass to get into the like past the first
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.320]   line of security.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.560]   We went up to the press table and we sort of like, basically
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.840]   were able to talk our way into sort of a junior press pass and
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.440]   went on to the red carpet and found a place.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.800]   So the red carpet, there's like all these spots for different
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.080]   press.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.200]   So there was one spot where no one was standing.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.360]   And so they hadn't shown up yet, or they weren't going to show
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.960]   up. And I just stood there, hoping that that outlet wasn't
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.600]   going to show up.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.800]   And then the red carpet started and all this, the, the stars
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.360]   started to come down.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.960]   And then Megan Fox came down.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.720]   And I was like, okay, this is my, this is my moment.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.400]   And I was getting more and more nervous as she started to
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.360]   approach like so nervous.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.440]   And she got in front of me and I said, my name is Ben.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.200]   It's nice to meet you.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.160]   I have my microphone that's tucked in my pocket.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.840]   And she says, oh, that's, it's nice to meet you.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.120]   My, my first boyfriend's name was Ben.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.400]   And then I started to get very flustered.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.640]   And as I was about to ask her out, her PR, her publicist was
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.760]   like, okay, that's enough and took her away.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.960]   And I totally blew my opportunity.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.120]   I didn't get to ask her out.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.440]   And so it was a massive fail, but we did make up for it the
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.120]   next year because my friend Duncan, his dream was to ask
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.400]   out Taylor Swift at the time.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.920]   And he was able to do that and he didn't blow it.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.200]   And he actually ended up going out on a date with her.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.440]   So it was a, it was a big fail, but we learned from it.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.240]   And, uh, and ultimately it's probably for the best that we
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.360]   didn't go on a date and she's happy now.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.480]   Are there, are there items, it sounds like, you know, because
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.160]   you had four people, are there things that other people checked
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.920]   off that you've since gone and said, wow, I, I kind of wanted
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.640]   to do that too, and gone and done, or were some of these
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.200]   always going to be one of your friends items and, and it wasn't
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.400]   really even a passion for you?
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.280]   Some of the things on the list were, I didn't want to do that.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.080]   One of the things was to ride a bull and my friend Dave was
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.880]   really wanting to do that.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.360]   And I just didn't want to.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.960]   And so we found a place that finally we'd let him get on a
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.600]   bull and, and he was able to ride it.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.680]   Most of the list items that we had were things that we all
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.640]   wanted to do together.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.200]   But if some person was really passionate about something, then
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   we would try and make that happen for that person.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.000]   And then when we helped other people, you know, that was the
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.240]   thing that they wanted to do.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.160]   And so we just did whatever we could to try and make that
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.800]   happen.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.600]   And sometimes we, we share that with them.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.840]   And sometimes that was completely their, their thing,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.440]   but always there was sort of the emotional tie of being able to
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.840]   share that experience with them.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.440]   And, and so we were able to sort of stay in touch with those
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.240]   people afterwards, because you kind of build this bond with
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.160]   them because you share this, this moment, whether it was
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.040]   like helping someone overcome a fear or helping them reconnect
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.600]   with someone that they hadn't seen in a long time or doing
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.840]   something for someone that they love.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.400]   So that was always the stuff that stuck with us.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.520]   I think the most throughout the, the journey was those moments
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.000]   when we were able to step into someone else's life and help
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.280]   them.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   So we'll move on from the list.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.200]   If you want to read the rest of it, I'll put a link in the show
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.640]   notes, but I kind of want to move on to this whole concept of
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.280]   a list.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.560]   Do you think most people have a bucket list, even if it's not
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   written down that they use to guide their life?
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.160]   Well, I think that we all probably like have heard about a
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.640]   bucket list from the film, or just because at this point,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.720]   everyone knows what it is.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.800]   But I kind of look at it a little bit differently.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.360]   I think most people think about adventure and travel when they
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.800]   think about a bucket list, like skydive, travel to Europe, these
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.640]   kind of exciting things that you want to do in your life.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.720]   And I think that those are important to have on your list.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   But I do think that that's only one category of your life.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.760]   And the way I look at a list is, it's a list of all the things
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.920]   that are going to bring you joy and happiness in your life.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.120]   And those can be big, and those can be small.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.800]   But the reality is, is that life always gets in the way.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.200]   And these things that we want to do that are going to, let's
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.920]   call them our personal goals and passions, which is they tend to
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.280]   get pushed because life gets in the way.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.640]   And that's actually what this whole project really is named
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.280]   after is a poem written in 1852, called The Buried Life, which my
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.800]   friend was assigned to an English class when we were coming
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.400]   up with this concept.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   And this poem was actually speaking about the exact same
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.000]   feeling that we were feeling then, which was that we had all
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.840]   these things that we want to do, but we hadn't done them because
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.520]   they were buried.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.840]   And you have moments when you're inspired to go after those
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.080]   things, but ultimately, they get buried by the day to day.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.440]   So we thought, well, we're not the first people to feel like
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.640]   this.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.800]   Why don't we borrow this name, The Buried Life, and try to
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.080]   unbury these dreams.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.520]   And that's what started this whole journey for us.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.520]   And so it's kind of human nature to push your personal passions
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.000]   and ambitions and goals because they don't have deadlines.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.920]   And everything else in our life has deadlines.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.520]   So something typically pops up that's more important.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.200]   So we almost eternally push these personal goals.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.280]   And most people at the end of their life, they don't regret
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.080]   the things they did.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.640]   They regret the things they didn't do because of this idea
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.160]   that we continually push these things.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.720]   So a bucket list just really, one, helps you define what's
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.480]   important to you.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.040]   And typically, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.680]   So it forces you to slow down and actually put that on paper.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.280]   But it also builds accountability.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.960]   And it's a very small step when you write something down, but it
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   is important because it makes these things that are intangible,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.240]   it makes them real.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.600]   So now you have a reminder that those goals exist.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.520]   And then there's many things that you can do to start to
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.200]   increase your chances of actually accomplishing those
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.080]   things. But I think just at its basic form, a bucket list is
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.200]   just a reminder of those things that are important to you.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.840]   Because it's just a device.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.720]   And if you don't have some sort of device to remind yourself,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.040]   they get buried.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.640]   And so anything you can do to create accountability and to
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.880]   remind yourself of those things that are going to bring you
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.480]   true joy and happiness in all categories of your life, it's
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.280]   important to figure out ways to do that because it's just a
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.680]   muscle that we all need to build in my mind as we live in
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.160]   this world that I feel like continues to pull you away from
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.960]   your true self.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.640]   And your bucket list is just a reflection of that true self.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.160]   So it sort of keeps you on track.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.800]   It's like that that true north that is guiding you in the
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.360]   direction that you want to go so that you can stay true to
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.200]   the things that you know are really important to you.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.920]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.040]   You mentioned the kind of regrets people have at the end
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.360]   of their lives. And I know you've kind of dug into a little
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.560]   bit of the research or the data about what those are.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.680]   Could you talk a little bit more about what you've learned
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.240]   and kind of what's the takeaway from how people feel kind of
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.320]   towards the end of their lives?
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.400]   Yeah, so there's this really interesting study by a
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.040]   psychologist named Tom Gilovich.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.200]   And he's, he's also a professor at Cornell, but effectively, he
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.840]   asked people at the end of their life, what's your number one
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.520]   regret people on their deathbed, and he found that 76% of people
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.960]   that he asked had the exact same answer, which was not living my
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.160]   ideal self.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.400]   So living a life that I thought other people expected of me or
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.840]   that other people wanted for me.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.080]   And when I heard that, I was just I was kind of shocked.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.800]   I was like, well, 76% that is an overwhelming majority of the
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.000]   population that will live their entire life, reach their
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.520]   deathbed, and on their deathbed, look back and reflect on their
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.040]   life and basically think, damn it, I completely overlooked the
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.360]   things that I wanted to do, I didn't take time for those small
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.240]   things that were important to me.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.840]   And so if that is three quarters of the population, why is that
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.240]   happening?
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.160]   Why?
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.760]   Why is the majority feeling like that at the end of life, I can't
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.040]   imagine feeling like that on my deathbed, that I lived this life
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.800]   for other people or that what other people expected of me.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.240]   And so as I started to dig into why this is the case, and also
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.920]   what are simple ways to not end up like that, that's kind of
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.840]   became my sort of purpose of why I speak and, and why I'm doing
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.320]   what I'm doing is to sort of bring down that percentage by
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.120]   some small fraction so that more people at least when they get to
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.280]   the end of their life, they think, you know what, at least I
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.680]   tried to do those things.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.880]   And if it didn't work, it didn't work.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.640]   But then I don't have the regret of not even trying to go after
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.040]   those, those things that were important to me.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.480]   And what do you think are kind of the various reasons that
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.200]   people end up in that circumstance?
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.560]   Well, it's actually so it's interesting.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.400]   So through his research, he found three things.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.080]   Number one, there's no deadlines, which I spoke to
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.400]   previously, right, there's, we have deadlines for all these
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.680]   other parts of our lives.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.720]   But with our personal goals, there's no deadlines.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.480]   That's number one.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.560]   The second is that usually when it comes to these goals, we wait
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.160]   to feel inspired to go after them.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.720]   But the inspiration just doesn't hit like it.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.040]   I have a guitar.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.800]   It's sitting in the corner.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.520]   I'm still waiting to feel inspired to pick it up and play
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.480]   like you have to create your own inspiration by taking action,
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.040]   which is kind of a cool idea that you're the architect of
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.160]   your own inspiration just through by movement, right, just
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.480]   by creating your own momentum.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.600]   You can start to create your own inspiration.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.560]   And the third, which Mr.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.240]   Gilovich found to be the biggest is, is fear.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.160]   So it's either the fear of what other people think or the fear
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.640]   of failure, which you hear about fear and you know about these
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.200]   fears.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.080]   And I think that when you start to look at these fears more
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.040]   closely and identify what are real feel fears and what are
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.160]   some of more of the imagined fears, you can start to kind of
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   see that some of these fears actually aren't real threats or
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.960]   not least the threats that you think they are.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.040]   And so it's the fact there's no deadlines.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.200]   It's a fact that there's, you wait to feel inspired.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.560]   And it's the fact that there's this fear of what other people
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.800]   think and the fear of failure.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.960]   And so I think there are ways that you can start to move
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.840]   through those three barriers.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   And that's effectively what the bucket list journal is designed
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.200]   to do.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.440]   It's designed to first identify what are those things that are
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.680]   important to you and in all 10 categories of your life, not
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.800]   just the, the, the adventure and the travel.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.400]   And then it's okay.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   Now, you know that these are the things that are important.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.280]   You've taken the time to think about them.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.200]   These are the things that you want to prioritize.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.440]   These are the things that can't get buried by the day to day.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.600]   Now let's move through those barriers of creating
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.680]   accountability so that we can move towards those things.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.000]   Let's create inspiration through action and let's move through
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.360]   those, those two fears.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.040]   And so that's kind of what the journal is designed to do.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.760]   I mean, I wish everyone listening had a copy of it right
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.280]   now, definitely go order it.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.680]   It's a beautiful journal.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.160]   I, I want to first understand the categories.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.000]   How did you break down everything you could want to do
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.480]   in your life into 10 things?
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.280]   Was that a hard process?
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.600]   How, how did it go about and kind of, how did you end
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.520]   up with the 10 you have?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.360]   So people have looked at this before, and if you Google 12
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.600]   categories of life, I took them from different versions of people
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.320]   coming up with these 12 categories.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.080]   And I looked at when you think about your goals, how, how
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.000]   would your goals fall into these categories?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.240]   And, and, and, and that's how I came up with the 10.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   And so there, there, there will be things that I think you could
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.280]   find outside of these 10 categories.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.080]   And I would, I would love to hear what those are, if you find
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.760]   them, and I would also encourage you just to basically add them
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.320]   to your, to your list, but effectively they're travel and
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.680]   adventure, which we know physical health.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.120]   So what are your physical goals?
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.160]   And this could be anything from specifically an achievement run
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.840]   a marathon, or it could be getting back to something that
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.960]   you used to love that you don't do anymore, like tennis, or it
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   could be more about like screen time and that type of things
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.120]   that affect you physically.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.280]   And then there's, uh, material goals.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.000]   Like it's okay to have material goals.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.640]   I think on your bucket list, like you have a dream watch,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.360]   you have a dream car.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.600]   Do you want to get a place on the beach to hang out with your
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.800]   grandkids or your kids?
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.000]   Uh, you know, those types of things I think should be on your
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.320]   list.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.720]   And then there's your creative goals, which I think creativity
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.600]   is, is sort of an overlooked pillar of wellness.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   If you think about like how you got to this podcast and starting
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   this podcast, I feel like you're so good at this because this is
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.240]   almost what you're meant to do when you are doing your podcast.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.920]   This is almost like a creative expression that you get to
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.640]   fulfill.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.000]   And so it's, it's really being really true to yourself and
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.440]   letting this piece out of you.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.040]   And when you're creative, that's what you're doing, whether it's
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.320]   playing, uh, an instrument or it's doing art or it's doing
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.600]   other stuff, a type of creative expression, you're, you're
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.920]   tapping into this truest core element of who you are and
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.520]   letting that out.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.720]   So I think it's therapeutic.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.840]   I think it's important to allow yourself to express those
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.360]   creative urges, even if they don't lead to anything that has
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.320]   anything to do with what you do professionally, you know, things
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.680]   like start to write that book, take painting classes, take
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.440]   improv classes, start that YouTube channel, all those
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.400]   things that you dream of doing that fulfill that creative
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.320]   bucket are important on your list.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.360]   Yeah, I did an episode with Chase Jarvis, maybe a month or
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.720]   two ago talking about creativity.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.400]   And it was funny because I didn't really realize that I was
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.120]   as creative as I might be.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.520]   And I also didn't realize that flexing the kind of muscles that
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.480]   you use to create things, create art, create music are similar
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.560]   muscles that you can use to create your life and create
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.160]   purpose.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.800]   And so we talked a lot about that, how to get through creative
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.760]   blocks, check out that episode if you're interested, but this
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.800]   was one that prior to that conversation, when I was looking
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.440]   through the book, I was like, I probably would have looked at
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.320]   this and moved on.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.720]   And now I feel like it's one of the categories I have more
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.000]   things in I really struggled with material stuff.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I feel like that that really wasn't necessarily for me.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.880]   And then physical health was a big one.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.760]   I was like, I need to go back and beat the PR that I set on my
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.560]   Peloton like two years ago, like my goal is to get back in pre
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.160]   COVID shape, which feels like far away.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.400]   Yeah, I just wanted to flag that because because I think
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.040]   creativity is something we overlook a lot of times, and
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.160]   don't realize that it's probably a deeper part of our life than
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.640]   we think.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.360]   I agree. I think you touched on it, too.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.880]   I think it can really lead to purpose.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.360]   And I think when you think about and you hear about finding your
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.160]   purpose, I think is a very overwhelming question.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.360]   And I think that it's also very loaded.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.680]   And I don't think it needs to be as loaded.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.440]   When you think about what's my purpose, how do I find my
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:53.760]   purpose?
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.240]   Well, one way you can find your purpose is by is by following
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.280]   things that excite you and also following your creativity.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.200]   And so if you think about, again, just to use example of
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.800]   you creating this podcast, so that was probably out of this
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.000]   creative urge or this urge of following this thing, this idea
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.160]   that really excited you.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.120]   And maybe you didn't expect it to lead you to where you are
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.320]   right now or have the success that it's having right now.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.800]   But that's usually how it goes.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.120]   Usually you'll start to do something out of the love of it
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.400]   and it might evolve into something that creates a whole
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.200]   life of its own.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.920]   And so that's what happened with our documentary.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.360]   And the bucket list was this was just supposed to be a two week
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.680]   road trip in 2006.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.320]   And it just continued to unravel.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.640]   And we leaned into that momentum and we leaned into that
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.680]   excitement and that creativity of making a film and making
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.200]   videos.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.880]   And that's what led us to the television show.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.120]   And and and so I think that you can come back to, OK, what are
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.080]   these creative urges that I have?
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.400]   If they don't go anywhere, it's totally fine.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.600]   I just want to express myself and do these things because
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.400]   they're they're fun.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.160]   And hey, maybe they turn into something, maybe they don't.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.920]   But at the very least, I get to actually express that part of
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.240]   myself.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.680]   And I think that it always will lead to good things if at the
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.440]   very least it energizes you for the rest of your sort of life,
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.840]   quote unquote, I mean, like it energizes you to do the things
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.040]   that you have to do professionally and the other
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.560]   things that you have to do, which really is like what this
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.000]   whole idea is about is like you want to take care of yourself
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.480]   so that you can serve other people.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.120]   You want to do these things on your list because when you do
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.480]   the things that you love, you're more alive, you have more
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.320]   energy, then you can deploy that energy in all aspects of
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.800]   your life.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.480]   And so that's sort of the narrative that you want to think
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.400]   about when you're thinking about your personal goals.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.360]   It's not selfish to have these goals, it's actually service.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.160]   So the fifth is professional.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.400]   So any goals that you have in your life professionally, you
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.680]   take some time and you think about those, whether that's
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.520]   specifically a job that you want to have or it's in your role.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.720]   Is it a promotion?
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.000]   Is it becoming a better leader?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.600]   Is it starting a side hustle?
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.520]   Those types of things.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.240]   Then you have your financial goals, which is the sixth
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.120]   category of life.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.880]   So anything money related.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.040]   This could be investment benchmarks, income goals or
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.600]   feeling financially secure or free or leaving things behind.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.400]   Then you have the seventh category, which is intellectual.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.760]   So anything you have for your brain, what do you want to
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.120]   learn?
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.680]   So this could be reading, learning a new skill and anything
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.160]   that would fall under that feeding your brain.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.640]   What are your intellectual goals?
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.520]   The eighth category, arguably the most important is your
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.160]   mental health.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.280]   So how do you want to increase your emotional, spiritual
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.880]   well-being or just take care of you?
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.160]   And this is so important, obviously, especially now during
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.360]   the pandemic, with so many people struggling with many
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.160]   different things.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.960]   I think that now more than ever, it's important to take
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.280]   care of our mental health and also be open about talking
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.640]   about the struggles that we're going through, make sure that
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.240]   we ask for help, make sure that we have a support system
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.960]   around us.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.080]   And for someone who has struggled with mental health,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.720]   for me, and we can talk about this at any time, but
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.840]   basically the buried life for me started because I had a
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.800]   depression, went through a depression when I was in
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.680]   university and it forced me to look at a lot of things.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.800]   And so this category is extremely important for me.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.200]   And also I think it's important for anybody to look at.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.600]   And so again, let's just moving through the last two
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.400]   categories.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.880]   The ninth is relationships.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.560]   This category, all about the people that you love, right?
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.240]   Your partner, your friends, your family.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.080]   One of the regrets of the dying is not staying in touch
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.880]   with old friends.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.240]   So this is an important category to invest in the
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.640]   relationships that are important to you.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.760]   And I do see them as, as investments because you have
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.520]   to invest the time in those relationships that mean a
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.600]   lot to you in order to nourish them and, and have those
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.920]   types of relationships throughout your life.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.840]   So you want to identify what those relationships are and
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.240]   maybe it's prioritizing romantic love, or maybe it's
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.520]   prioritizing friendships or making sure that you prioritize
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.840]   a trip with your friends once a year, date night twice a
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.680]   week with your spouse, those types of things.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.880]   And the last is the giving category.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.800]   So this is just, how do you want to make an impact?
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.920]   How do you want to give?
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.160]   These could be in small interactions with people
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.040]   throughout the day, or it could be helping someone else
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   that you care about pursue their dream.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.160]   It could be more time on a cause that means something to you.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.560]   It could be some sort of trip that you take to make an
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.680]   impact or just every day focusing on recycling every
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.720]   piece of plastic you use or doing something that, that
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.360]   gives back on a small scale.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.320]   Getting the crew together.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.880]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.640]   I get it.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.320]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.200]   probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.280]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.640]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.720]   Drizzly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.760]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.600]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.000]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.520]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.640]   drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.080]   your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.240]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.840]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.400]   hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.040]   delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   than my local liquor store.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.160]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.520]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:11.600]   When your projects get more complex, finding what you're looking for across
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.960]   your entire workspace gets so much harder, that's where Notion Q&A comes in.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.760]   It answers any question you have, making use of your entire database
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.680]   of knowledge to make sure the answers are actually helpful.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.040]   If you're not familiar, Notion is an amazing product that combines
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.840]   your notes, docs, and projects all together in one beautiful space.

[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.120]   I've used it to find information from old notes, answer questions
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.960]   about a marketing plan, or even find my upcoming travel details, all in seconds.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.840]   You can also ask Q&A questions in just plain English from anywhere in Notion,

[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.520]   I love the features Notion keeps shipping, and it just reinforces
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.880]   our decision to use it as the central place we manage our life and work.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.360]   It also makes me even more excited to be partnering with them for this episode.

[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.400]   So those are the 10 categories of life.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.280]   And I think when you write your list, you want to think about all those
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.680]   different categories, and that's where you start your bucket list from.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.760]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.280]   You, you mentioned you got the idea from the 12 categories.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.840]   Were there two categories that you got rid of or did you merge them
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.280]   or how did you get from 12 to 10?
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.160]   Yeah, I merged them together.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.040]   There was a spiritual category.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.960]   So I kind of rolled that into some of the mental health
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.600]   and some of the relationships.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.080]   And there was one other category that I can't remember now, but I kind
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.640]   of put that into one of the other ones.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.680]   I did like the, the 10 as a round number two.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   I thought 10 was good.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.280]   It was a good exercise to run through this.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.320]   And I almost wish there were somewhere I was like, this is all for me.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.400]   And there was somewhere I was like sitting down with my wife being
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.720]   like, what do you want to add in here?
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.200]   I'm a big fan of, of kind of sharing your bucket list with people.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.480]   And so the one I, I tracked prior to your book was in a Google sheet
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.800]   and I had a few friends in there.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.880]   It's like, oh, wow, we all have the same one.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.440]   Maybe we should go do this thing together.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.960]   So I'm a big fan of sharing, which I know is one of your accountability things.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.000]   But before we get there, I just love to hear a little bit of your kind
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.320]   of do's and don'ts kind of rules and tips to kind of create a list.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.400]   That's both, I guess, exciting.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.320]   I feel like one of the things I learned when I was looking online for
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.640]   inspiration for my original bucket list was that, you know, they were all
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.120]   just kind of like, oh, see the Eiffel Tower or like, it didn't feel like
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.520]   they really pushed you as hard as they could.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.440]   And so I really wanted a list that pushed me in every aspect.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.880]   And I think some of the things in the book reminded me that
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.600]   I wasn't pushing in every way.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.720]   But kind of, what do you tell people to do when they start creating a
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.320]   list to really push themselves and kind of then after that accomplish things?
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.400]   I think one trick that I've kind of think about, and this has been
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.960]   consistent since the beginning, because this, the question, what do you want
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.160]   to do before you die was, is the question that we asked ourselves to make our list.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.040]   And now it's a question that we ask strangers as we traveled to see what
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.880]   they wanted to do and ultimately see if we could, we could help them.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.160]   But this idea of reminding yourself that you're going to die one day,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.360]   that your time is limited, puts things in perspective.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.080]   And so by really confronting and digesting that mortality, you, you're
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.720]   able to sometimes get clarity on what's important to you, not what's important
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.920]   to other people or what you think other people think is important to you.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   So sometimes I think, what would I regret not doing if I died tomorrow?
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.840]   And it's not so much about what are, what's the biggest goal?
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.080]   Because I think there really is no rule with a bucket list.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.840]   The only rule is that it's important to you.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.440]   So when you think about what would you regret not doing if you died tomorrow,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.600]   that could be something like, ah, like I really wish I would have taken that trip
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.920]   with my dad, or I really wish that I would have told someone how I really felt, or I
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:25.040]   really wish that I would have just started to work and finish that book because that's
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.120]   what I want to leave behind.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:33.080]   And so I think that it's, it's, it's important to, if you have a big dream to,
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.840]   to let that out.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.200]   So as you said, like you realize, oh, I wasn't pushing myself.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   There's all these, these dreams that I had that were audacious and I want to go
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.760]   after them.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   Those need to come out, but I don't want you to think that a bigger dream is better
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.360]   than a smaller dream, because really what this is, is it's more about being true to
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:50.960]   yourself.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:57.160]   And so it, it's about identifying what's for you so that when you end your life, you
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.840]   look back and think, yeah, you know what?
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.240]   I feel really good about what I tried to do and what I accomplished and what I, what
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.200]   I went after that.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.320]   I don't have any regrets.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.160]   So I answered your question in a bit of a different way, but I think that from that
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.760]   is, I think is just an important baseline when you're thinking about your list.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.120]   And then once you start to write your list, I do think there are a couple of
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.360]   things that are, that are important.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.040]   Number one, I think you want to attach a timeline or a deadline, because if you
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.120]   think about one of the problems we have, I'll go back to no deadlines.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.640]   So there's no accountability.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.720]   We have so many structures of accountability in our professional lives.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.400]   That's what drives us forward, right?
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.840]   We have leaders checking in on us.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.400]   We have a salary to keep us accountable.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.360]   We don't want to look bad, right?
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.080]   So we stay accountable.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.520]   And in our personal lives and with these, these we'll call them like these bucket
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.000]   list goals, we don't have those systems of accountability.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.760]   So how can we create those in our personal life?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.960]   Well, you can create your own deadlines.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.400]   You can, so that means attaching a timeline to your goal.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.600]   You can create your own rewards so that if you achieve it, you get
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.120]   something that you love, or if you achieve a step towards that goal, you
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.880]   can achieve it, that, that thing that you love, as you said, you have a list with
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:19.120]   your partner that is so important because all of a sudden you feel a bit accountable
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.400]   to them because you've, you have the shared goal or you've, you have friends
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.960]   that are, that are also in this document.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.880]   So you feel accountable.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.160]   The more you tell people, the more you feel accountable to the people
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.120]   that you've shared that with.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.600]   So, so you're 77% more likely to achieve your goal.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.000]   If you have someone checking in with you down the line, or you
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   send regular updates to that person.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.200]   So how can you get an accountability buddy?
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.160]   You have your partner, you may have your friends.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.800]   So it's so important to share your goals and also to create this system
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.240]   where they're checking in on you or you're sending updates.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.840]   You could be in a group chat.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.720]   It could be, you could do it any way that you like, but the basic
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.880]   idea is to create this accountability.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.680]   So I think that as you write your list, you want to think about that.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.240]   And you also want to write your list in a way that you
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.880]   know when you've achieved it.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:18.440]   So you don't want to say something like prioritize love or get in shape because
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.880]   you don't know when you've achieved that.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.920]   You want to say something like for love, like maybe it's go on two
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.520]   dates per week or forget in shape.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.200]   It's run five miles twice per week, or it's not travel more.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.160]   It's visit three new countries this year.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.600]   It's not be healthier.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.920]   It's X, Y, Z.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.200]   So be specific so that you've achieved your goal.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.280]   Be affirmative.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:45.440]   You know, you can say, I will do this instead of try and also attach the
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.440]   deadline, attach the reward and focus on actions more than intentions.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.680]   So I think those are some of the things to think about when you're
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.680]   actually penning your dreams down.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.760]   I mean, the thing that I thought was great about the book was when I
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.520]   started writing down some of my things, it wasn't just a list for everyone
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.400]   who doesn't have a copy yet at the beginning of the book, it's how do
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.720]   you create this, what is your list?
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.320]   But then there's a page for each item and it really forces you to
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.800]   break down how to achieve this.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.040]   And something I did earlier was I decided that every month I have to
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.120]   do something memorable and I had a list of everything every month and I
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.440]   started planning it out and it's not just having items, it's deciding when
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.000]   you're going to do them and how that pushed me to do that.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.600]   So I really appreciate that you didn't just make a book that was 20 pages and
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.240]   had the list, but it also forces you to find ways to be accountable, to find
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.160]   ways to set timing because I think that it is ultimately, like you said, just
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   writing it down, I think is 50% chance you'll get it, but the accountability
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.720]   and the deadlines helps, you know, tremendously beyond that.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:48.400]   Totally.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.520]   And what you just mentioned, so this, the idea of making a plan
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.280]   is, that is very important.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.360]   So there's this, there's a study called mindset theory from New York
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.040]   university that effectively talks about by spending time identifying both the
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.160]   means as well as the, or how you're going to act, you heighten your chances
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.920]   of successfully attaining that goal.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.880]   So all of these things start to effectively create that accountability.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.920]   And so not all of these things are going to work for everyone, but if you can
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.720]   start to try to see which of these things stick and work for you in your life, you,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.840]   I think you're going to increase your chances of actually pursuing those things.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.400]   And as you said, the, the first step is, is, is writing it down.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.560]   And, and I love how earlier you pushed back on me and said, it doesn't
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.800]   all have to be these wild goals.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.160]   I know a lot of the things in your list for the show were, but some of them
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.480]   weren't, and I, I'd never actually grown any facial hair and over COVID.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.280]   I finally decided to give it a try after, after trying once and failing to have the
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.640]   most inappropriate mustache you can have, because it just looked like the kind of
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.600]   guy who drives a van around the playground.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   And that was a small thing.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.960]   And so I like how you push back and said, what are some goals that
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.480]   you can do that might be smaller?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.720]   But I think when it comes to the big things, everyone has really, really
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.320]   kind of crazy things that they might want to accomplish in their life.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.040]   And I know you've given, you know, quite a few talks on ways that people can kind
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.560]   of take things that are impossible and make them possible.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.840]   And I'm curious if you could imagine someone's reading your book, wrote down
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.480]   some things that they think are impossible.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.240]   They get to the page where they're trying to articulate how
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.400]   they can actually do that.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.600]   What advice do you have for someone who's trying to make something that's
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.360]   really audacious, kind of become a reality?
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.320]   I think, so one is to look at that biggest thing that stops us, which is fear.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.240]   So, you know, the fear of what other people think or fear of failure, which,
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.720]   by the way, these are fears that we all feel.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.440]   These are, these are like taxes you have to pay to do great things.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.120]   And you start to realize that these things don't go away, but you get
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.960]   comfortable with that discomfort of moving through those fears.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.600]   So again, like I just not to beat a dead horse, but to come back to
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.520]   the podcast that you started, like, I'm sure there were fears.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.720]   What are people going to think?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.480]   What if I start and it fails?
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.520]   What are they, what are they going to think?
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.560]   I don't do this in my job and now I'm going to start doing this other thing.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.360]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.480]   Like all of these fears probably started to bubble up, but you can,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.520]   you can sort of unpack both of those.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.400]   The fear of what other people think.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.840]   I read that this dates back to when we were hunter gatherers.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.960]   And if we went out for a hunt and we came back without a kill, we were at
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.360]   risk of getting kicked out of the tribe.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.200]   If we did something that was wrong in the tribe, we got sort of, we're at
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.080]   risk of getting kicked out.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.480]   And that kind of meant certain death because we lived in the tribe.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.760]   This sort of gets passed on.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.520]   We all have this fear of what other people think.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.120]   And the truth is now that when it comes to the fear of what other people
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.920]   think, people just aren't thinking about you as much as you think they are.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.800]   Right.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.560]   They're busy, worried about living their own life.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.480]   And they're also worried about what other people are thinking
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.240]   about them all the time.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.680]   So it's, it's almost more of, of, of a made up fear because I found that
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.960]   people are also more supportive and accommodating than, than you think they
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.360]   might be.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:19.160]   So again, if your basic needs are met, sometimes this fear of what other
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.320]   people think is, is more of a made up fear.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.200]   The fear of failure is, is hard to get around.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.080]   But I think that one way to look at it is if you're afraid to go after your
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.760]   goal or you're waiting for the right time, you failed because you didn't
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.440]   achieve your goal.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.720]   So at least when you try and you fail, what you learn from that really outweighs
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.320]   any potential hit to, to your reputation.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.040]   And so I think as you start to sort of peel back the onion and look at what are
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.240]   the real risks?
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.120]   I have this fear, but what, what am I at risk of, of losing?
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.400]   And if that is something that you can't live without, then that's something to
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.120]   take pause and be like, okay, should I, should I do this or should I not do this?
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:05.560]   Do, if this doesn't work, am I going to be at a place where I'm in a very
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.000]   difficult spot financially?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.440]   Or is this going to put me in a spot where I can't have my basic needs met?
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.600]   But if it's, if it's something outside of that, and it's more of an, uh, an ego
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.200]   thing, or it's more what will people think, or it's going to be wrapped up in
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.640]   that, then I think it's something to, to take a look at.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   And that's just kind of writing down what are the real risks when you look at, or
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.800]   when you think about the fears.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.600]   I, the fear thing's a big piece.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.840]   I think another thing that I've done personally is, and use this podcast as
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.440]   example, trying to, you know, reach out to some guests that, you know, maybe
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.040]   wouldn't want to come on a show back when it didn't exist, was just try to
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.640]   break it down into smaller steps.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.200]   So it's okay.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.840]   Well, I want to get X person on the show.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.920]   How do I do that?
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.760]   Well, who do I know that knows that person or what other podcasts have they
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.720]   been on and, and what other guests have been on those podcasts?
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.120]   And do I know any of those people?
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.920]   And, you know, just trying to think about, can I at least make a list
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.240]   of people who could be guests?
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.520]   So the thing that's really helped me is, you know, if the goal is to land, you
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.400]   know, an A-list, you know, guest on your podcast, that sounds crazy, but if you
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.880]   start to break it down and slowly work your way towards it, that's been really
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.520]   helpful for me.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.120]   I'm not sure if there are other things in your kind of steps to make the
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.440]   impossible possible, but that was one for me.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.280]   I mean, that's, I think that's where most people stop is that first step.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:33.320]   And you, you don't need to know the full road to completion.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.440]   Like you don't need to know how you're going to get that guest
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.800]   ultimately on your podcast.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.080]   All you need to know is the first step.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.640]   And then you can figure out the second step after the first step.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.600]   So the first step was, okay, let's write a list of all the people that may have
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.080]   some sort of connection to this person.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.400]   And you take that first step.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.720]   And once you do that, you say, okay, well then I'm going to reach out to some of
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.400]   these people that are, I have a better relationship with than others.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.760]   And I'm going to ask them there.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.680]   And then all of a sudden you've created this momentum and you're all of a sudden
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.880]   on the road to achieving your goal.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.640]   And that is this creation of inspiration that I was talking about before.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.440]   So by taking that first step, you create that, that movement.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.360]   And, and a lot of people stop at that, at that first step, because it's so
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.200]   overwhelming to think, how am I going to achieve this big goal?
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.400]   I'm paralyzed, right?
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.880]   And so just by identifying what's the easiest thing that you can do.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.360]   So first you look at the fears, okay, what's at risk here.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.960]   And then you just start to take action, small steps.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.760]   What's the first thing I can think of?
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.400]   Write that down.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.600]   Let's take that step.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.840]   And you, there's this other study from the frontiers in psychology, which
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.040]   talks about the psychological momentum that's created when you get these
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.800]   sequential runs of success.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.640]   And so that's just the momentum that you start to create when you, when
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.760]   you march towards your goal.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.800]   Even if you hit a roadblock, you, you're, you're building this momentum.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.400]   So again, it's like I looking at the fears, it's starting to take the first step.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:04.200]   And the other thing is it's a lot of it is old, just old fashioned persistence.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.080]   If I don't, you can't underestimate the power of persistence when you're
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.640]   going after some of these goals.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.000]   And I found that sometimes you don't know what's possible until you're doing it.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:20.120]   So you just are just continuing to be creative in your persistence.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.320]   You're continuing to be authentic to yourself and authentic when you're
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.200]   pursuing these things and asking for help.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.360]   And, and I think that you made a good point when you made a list of people
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:36.920]   that you could ask is, is asking people for help when you're going after your
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:42.000]   goals, it's okay to ask people if they can help you along the way, because I
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.960]   found that people step up in unexpected ways when you reach out and ask for help.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:53.240]   So it's, again, if you, if you're able to do these things and also start to build
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.360]   this accountability alongside your, your journey towards the goal, the, the, the
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:03.240]   accountability is like the fuel that fuels you and, and all of these other
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.800]   things are hopefully going to start to move you in the right direction.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.480]   And as you, as you, as you go towards that bigger goal.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.680]   Is there an example from your list, whether it's the list from the show or
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:19.240]   your own list of something that was really big that you had to kind of break
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:25.440]   down, try, make progress, have persistence, go overcome fear, or kind of as many of
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.160]   those things as possible that we could walk through?
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.000]   Yeah, well, let's take the president Obama's example, because we had
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.320]   mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.880]   So no clue how to even start.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.680]   We're Canadian, no connections to Washington.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.480]   So only thing we could think of is just drive to Washington, start
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   asking people on the street.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.400]   Do you know anybody that's connected to this president?
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:51.080]   And obviously that didn't get us very far, but we found that we could contact
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.920]   politicians offices through their websites.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.800]   And so we would send hundreds of emails to anyone.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.840]   We could find a publicly listed email for say, we're in DC.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.080]   We're trying to play basketball with the president to prove
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.400]   that anyone can do anything.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.520]   And again, most people ignored us, but there were a few lower level officials
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.680]   that agreed to meet with us and we'd meet with them and we found that we could
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.560]   sometimes convince them in the meeting to convince their boss to meet with us.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.200]   So they would either send an email, they'd make a call or the boss would
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.160]   be there in the other room, they'd bring them in.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.600]   And so we were slowly moving up the ladder and we got all the way up to the
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.680]   secretary of transportation of the United States, right?
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.680]   He's like very confused about what this meeting was about.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.440]   But after we explained what we were doing, he actually picked up the phone
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:37.240]   while we were in the meeting and he called the white house and he said, you
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.720]   know, I'm meeting with these guys.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.920]   I don't know how they got my office, but I assure you they will cause no
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.400]   embarrassment to the president hangs up.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.480]   And so we're very excited after that meeting.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.440]   And I get an email right away from the white house.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.800]   And this is an official rejection.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   They're basically like, well, thank you for your inquiry, but it is not
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:03.120]   possible to arrange a basketball game with the president, sincerely, the
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.080]   white house office of appointments and scheduling.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:12.880]   And so we were like, okay, this is a hard no in writing, but we had a great
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.480]   intro.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.520]   I feel like at that point, you've got the secretary of transportation making
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.200]   a warm intro and there's a no.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.680]   How did you, you didn't give up though?
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.600]   No, because at that point we had learned that there was these secret basketball
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.480]   games that happened with the president and there was a gatekeeper and he was
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.560]   his personal aid.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.760]   So I don't know if you remember, there's this gentleman named Reggie love, who
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.040]   is the personal aid of the president.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.160]   He had played basketball for Duke university and he was always on the
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.320]   court with president Obama.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.200]   He set up all these basketball games and it was, it was, we heard as via text to
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.600]   a select few people.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.680]   And so we thought, okay, that's who we need to get ahold of.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.120]   And we found what we thought might be his email.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.240]   And we started sending him emails, challenging him and the president to a
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:55.920]   basketball game.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.960]   So we say like, you know, dear Reggie, you and the president versus us tonight,
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.320]   seven 30 at the YMCA be there.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.160]   And we'd show up at seven 30 with our basketball, like dressed in our
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.240]   basketball gear, right?
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.360]   Seven 30, there's no president there.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.240]   We're like, okay, next day, dear Mr.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:12.880]   Love, we're sorry.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.800]   We missed you yesterday.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.680]   Same time tonight, seven 30 show up again for a week.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.960]   We did this until finally we're like, okay, we've done everything we can think
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.080]   of.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.240]   We actually picketed outside the white house with signs.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.480]   We left voicemails at the white house.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.520]   You can call and leave a voicemail at the white house.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.200]   We, we did, we didn't hear back.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.320]   No one would take our meetings.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.200]   We heard that Reggie Love, uh, worked out at the YMCA at 5:00 AM.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   We'd go at 5:00 AM.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.960]   We didn't see him.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.240]   We're like, we accept our defeat.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.040]   We move on.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.920]   Three weeks later, I got a blocked phone call coming into my phone.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.520]   And all I hear is what's this I hear about you wanting to play basketball
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.560]   against the president and I, and it was the personal aid Reggie Love.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.320]   And so I explained to him.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.320]   And he said, you know what?
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:54.760]   I like this.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.040]   I think I can make this happen.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.840]   Uh, I need to run it by the press team.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.680]   So give me two weeks, but I feel good about this.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.160]   I'll call you back.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.440]   Calls me back in two weeks.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.480]   He's like, talk with the press team.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.680]   It's not going to happen.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.160]   And we're like, well, devastated.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.360]   And at this point he's like, guys, listen, I'm sorry.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.040]   There's nothing I can do.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.000]   This is out of my hands.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.680]   If you're ever back in DC, please let me know.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.040]   Maybe I can give you a tour of the white house.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.320]   And so we thought, well, this guy feels bad for us, like this kind of kind, but
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.280]   we don't actually even think he necessarily means it, but cut to three
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.480]   months later, we're in DC, we send it to me, an email, he gets back to us.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.240]   And he says, guys, if you have time tomorrow, swing by the white house.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.320]   And so we're like, okay, if we have time, yes, we have time.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:31.960]   We'll make that.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.800]   And so we, and, and then he gives us a personal tour of the white house.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.280]   He walks us through the West wing, shows us the oval office.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.800]   We rented suits from a high school prom rental store.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.840]   Cause he didn't know what to wear.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.960]   We're go to the basketball courts in the backyard of the white house where
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.160]   the, it used to be tennis courts.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.600]   And there's now basketball courts, presidential seal on each hoop.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   And we're shooting around.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.280]   And all of a sudden we just hear president Obama stroll on the court.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.680]   Say, Hey guys, I heard you in town thought the least I could
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.000]   do is shoot a basket with you.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.480]   And we had no idea he was in town.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.080]   We had no idea who's going to show up and we were completely floored.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.640]   And we spent 15, 20 minutes with him shooting around.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.920]   There's a white house photographer there taking photos.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:22.440]   And it was a, it was definitely a moment where my whole belief system
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.040]   about what was possible shifted.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.760]   Cause I was, when we wrote that down, I was, there was no doubt in my
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.360]   mind that this would never happen.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.840]   It was just, we put it down kind of, cause it was the most ambitious,
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.360]   the craziest thing we could think of.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.480]   And it was like, made us laugh.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.240]   And here we were with the president.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.640]   And now from that point forward, I was like, wow, I guess.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.080]   You can really do anything.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.960]   It's like my, it shifted what I thought was, was possible.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   So after all of those no's, it was just that, that being persistent,
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.400]   continuing to just do that next thing that was in front of you, not knowing
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   how you're going to achieve it, but having this belief that somehow it can happen.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.880]   We were accountable because we had each other to drive us forward.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:11.280]   We were accountable because at that point we were actually also filming the show.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.080]   So that kept us accountable because we needed to create something, but
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.840]   ultimately the show, it was a failure.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.240]   The episode went out and it was a, we didn't do it.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.720]   It was, it was a, it was a complete failure, but we just felt like we're
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.360]   going to continue to try and make it happen no matter what.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:32.800]   And so that was definitely the most no's I've ever experienced.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.680]   And I realized that, you know what, you can get one no, five no's, a hundred no's.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.720]   Sometimes you're really just looking for one yes.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.160]   And all we were looking for was that one yes.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.280]   And finally we got the one yes.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.840]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.920]   And I guess, I guess maybe it would be easier if you waited 10 years and he's
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.960]   no longer president, but you made it happen.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.200]   So.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:57.360]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.920]   leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.440]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.840]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.120]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.280]   microwave cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.640]   partner with them for this episode.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.000]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.320]   scratch in the microwave, and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.240]   code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.

[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.000]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.760]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.520]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.040]   highly recommend David Chang's salmon rice.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.440]   It is so good.

[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.040]   last year, you have to check it out.

[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.200]   And while you can always enjoy Element cold, their new chocolate medley,
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.880]   which includes chocolate mint, chocolate chai, and chocolate raspberry
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.720]   is actually designed to be enjoyed hot.

[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.240]   You mentioned that you now, you know, this list is an evolving thing.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.880]   So forget that there were a hundred and there's four left.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.960]   Now you have other things.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.480]   Before we go, I want to hear, what are some of the new things on your
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.840]   list that you're excited about doing?
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.160]   I would love to cross off that number 100, go to space.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.680]   And obviously that's, that's more and more achievable now.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:21.360]   I've always, some of the travel ones I still have that I really love to do
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.680]   is go to India, go to Africa, do a safari, go to South Africa and Cape town.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:32.840]   And I think that the, the things that I would, I would, I would continue to
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.440]   pursue professionally is I've, I've sort of found this, I want to just bring more
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.680]   people into that minority of, of people that end their life, regretting this, not
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.120]   regretting those things that they didn't do.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:50.120]   So I want to continue to kind of spread this, this, this idea and this message.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.280]   So I think that could be any number of things, but it's been cool to like be
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.400]   re-inspired by this idea after that initial road trip in, in 2006.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.320]   And one of the things that I've, I've kind of realized is that the thing that
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.400]   like really changed my life, if I think about it is this, I made this conscious
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.560]   decision after I got depressed in university.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.840]   And by the way, like I was, I'd never experienced anything like this, right?
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.640]   I was like on the national rugby team.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.840]   I had an academic scholarship.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:24.000]   My first year at university, I put so much pressure on myself to succeed
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.080]   that I just burnt out and I got depressed.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.040]   I dropped out of school.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.840]   I got dropped from the national rugby team.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.320]   I became a shut-in in my parents' house.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.440]   And for someone who was very A type personality, this was a complete 180.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.200]   I was totally terrified.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.040]   I had no idea what was going on, why I was feeling the way I was feeling.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.320]   And one of the things that I did along with many other things, including
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.840]   therapy, including understanding what I needed to be healthy, taking pressure
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.000]   off of myself, also realizing that I was living the life that I thought I was
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.760]   supposed to be living, not necessarily the things that I wanted to do, which is
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:01.960]   where the bucket list came from, was I decided to try and only surround myself
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.560]   with people that were inspiring, people that were going to give me energy.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.320]   And there was this kid in the neighborhood that I grew up in that
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.280]   was making movies, and I thought that was so cool.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.920]   And so I thought that's someone who I should hang out with.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.000]   And so I called him up.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.680]   His name's Johnny.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.720]   I said, "Johnny, you make movies.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.360]   I want to make a movie.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.000]   Let's make a movie."
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.160]   And that's where The Buried Life came from.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.280]   And so that's one small decision completely changed everything for me.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.360]   And I think that's something that we all have control over to some extent, but I
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.880]   think there are people in our lives that drain us of energy and sometimes they're
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.200]   difficult to, they are part of your life.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.040]   Sometimes it's family.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.880]   Sometimes it's other people that you can't totally move away from, but you can be
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.280]   aware that they're going to take that energy from you, but you do have the
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.400]   choice to lean into relationships that are giving you energy.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:52.960]   And I think that what that does is it not only inspires you because you are
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.920]   inspired by what they're doing and because you're friends with them or you
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.120]   know them, it makes you think that you have the ability to do something similar.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.360]   I'm sure people have said to you, "Chris, your podcast, honestly, it's inspired
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.960]   me to do this, or it's made me think that I can do that," right?
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.720]   Because by doing what you love, you inspire other people to do what they love.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.840]   And in the beginning, I thought a bucket list was to prioritize my personal goals,
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.760]   but then I saw people around the world starting to go after their bucket list
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.400]   just because we were going after ours.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.080]   And this created this ripple effect.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:28.680]   And I think that if more people did what they love, it would have this
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.520]   ripple effect around the world.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:36.200]   And so if you surround yourself with people that are inspiring you and you
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:42.440]   lean into those relationships to meet their friends, you are subconsciously
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.200]   raising your level of thinking.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.280]   Because almost through osmosis, you start to believe that you can do bigger
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.040]   things because of these people that are around you.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.080]   And so I think it's such a powerful thing.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.960]   And I mean, just from my experience, that's something that I think about
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.360]   has really changed my life.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:03.400]   And I think that that sets your foundation.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:08.760]   So then you can move towards those goals that are so important to you that
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.720]   ultimately are going to inspire other people to do the thing that they want to
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.080]   do.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.240]   And so that ripple effect is very powerful as well.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.760]   Yeah, I mean, it couldn't be more true, right?
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:24.680]   You inspired me to go read the book, come up with a list, invite you on the
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.720]   show, talk about it.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.840]   I'm sure people listening to this will do the same and get the book and can kind
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   of continue to push that narrative.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.480]   And I think it's awesome.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.040]   I think there's nothing more exciting than kind of trying to live a fulfilling
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.400]   life.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:43.720]   And it's super scary, especially if that fulfilling life is not in line with the
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.960]   career you have now.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.720]   And it's not in line with, you know, the friends and the family and the
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.800]   relationships you have now.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:54.640]   But I appreciate you kind of pushing and pushing people to know that it's
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.280]   possible and inspiring them.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.200]   And I appreciate you coming on the show.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.240]   Thank you, man.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.440]   Yeah, no, it's been a it's been super exciting to, you know, I saw the first
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.760]   podcast that you did.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:08.080]   And even when you were on Kevin's podcast starting it.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:14.440]   And so to see the momentum that you've created, to see the rise, just anytime I
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:20.120]   see that, it just makes me feel excited because I it's proof that you can create
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.560]   whatever you want to create.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:27.640]   And so I think that it's just, it's, it's a powerful but intangible thing.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.800]   And, and when you think about even like, in a world where everything feels like
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:38.000]   it's sort of out of control, and where you don't necessarily have the power as
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.960]   one person to make an impact, you can make an impact because of the ripple
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.320]   effect.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:48.400]   So it and it's not just big achievements that create this impact.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.680]   Every day you have the ability because every action has a reaction to create a
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.720]   positive ripple effect.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:58.680]   So whether that's like, any gesture of gratitude or kindness, or any helping
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:04.960]   hand you have with strangers, you don't know the impact that creates, but it it
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.000]   does create this positive, invisible ripple.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.040]   And so it's empowering, because then you're able to think, well, like, I can
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.000]   actually make an impact just by the actions that I take.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.480]   And you don't know how that one compliment is going to affect that
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.400]   stranger, it could save their life, it really could.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.480]   And it's not being hyperbolic.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   You have the ability to do that.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:28.920]   And so I think that that's like empowering when you think about, okay,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.080]   I'm going to impact people by not only going after the things that I love in my
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:36.560]   bucket list of my dreams, I'm going to also have the ability to impact people
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.640]   just through my day to day interactions through this invisible ripple effect.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.160]   And, and that that that's something that can can keep you going.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.520]   Yeah, this has been awesome.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.840]   I've already encouraged everyone multiple times to check out the book.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.320]   I know you've got a site at BenNimden.com.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.720]   What else are you up to?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.080]   What else should people check out?
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:57.360]   So I would love to hear what you think of the book if you get the book.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.360]   And the best way to get ahold of me probably is through Instagram, which is
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.840]   just my name @BenNimden.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.920]   If you send me a message there, I'll get back to you.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:09.400]   But if you want to see the bucket list journal, the URL is
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.320]   BucketListJournal.co.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:17.040]   And I would encourage you to write your list with your friend, write your list
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.120]   with your spouse or your family and keep the journal forever.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.400]   I think you can you can pass this on to your kids and then it'd be cool thing to
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.200]   show them what your dreams are and what you accomplish.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   And the reason why you want to keep your list in in one place, it doesn't have to
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.560]   be in this journal, but somewhere, is because you want to go back to your list
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   and you want to update it.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.840]   Because as I said in the beginning of the podcast, your list grows over time.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.160]   And what happens is you want to take stuff off that you don't want to do
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:49.080]   anymore. You want to add new things, but you also want to look back and look at
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.000]   the things that you wrote on your list and realize that, wow, I wrote that, I
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.120]   thought that was impossible and look, it's done.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.080]   So that's proof that you can achieve those things.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.120]   And Chris, if you wrote down on your list, start a podcast that will hit the top
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.040]   10 or whatever, you probably would have thought it was impossible.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.400]   And now you look back and you're like, wow, I guess I did it.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   And the next challenge is not going to be as daunting as I may have thought.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.680]   Yeah, I only wish your book was around a while ago, because I feel like my
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.800]   bucket list that I created with friends was so much more focused on category one
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.080]   of travel and adventure that, you know, there were a few spatterings of maybe
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.120]   buy a house or create a family tree, but a lot of the other stuff wasn't there.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.440]   And I wasn't thinking that way, but now I can.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.560]   All right.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.760]   Maybe it's the vibe of a new year, but I am seriously so excited to refresh my
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.480]   bucket list and see what kinds of crazy things I can start doing.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.600]   I hope you all enjoyed the conversation.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.120]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.800]   If you haven't already checked out the All The Hacks newsletter,
