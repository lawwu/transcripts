[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.700]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast. And in this episode, I have
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.700]   a special guest with me, Ben Miller, founder and CEO of Fundrise. Welcome to the podcast
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.700]   again, Ben.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700]   Hey, Sam. How's it going?
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.080]   I'm really looking forward to talking to you because you have made a pretty big turnaround
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.240]   in terms of your outlook for 2024 real estate. Last time we spoke was at the end of August
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.600]   2023, and you seemed much more cautious back then. But I listened to a latest episode on
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.960]   Onward, the Fundrise podcast, and it was entitled Buying the Bottom. So to me, I was like, wow,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   buying the bottom. Is this it? Are the good times back? So I'd love to hear from you what
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840]   your new thesis is for this year.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.960]   Yeah. I mean, it's exciting. I'm very bullish on real estate. We went through 18 months
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.280]   of declines in real estate as a result of interest rate hikes. So real estate is inversely
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.920]   correlated with interest rates. Another way to think about interest rates is just like
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.520]   your P/E multiple. So same thing happened in tech. Same thing happened in the stock
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   market. You know, multiples fell. And basically in real estate, they essentially fell 50%.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.800]   So a property that was pricing at a four-cap rate is now pricing at a six-cap rate or something
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.560]   like that, for example. And so a cap rate is the same as a multiple. It's just inverse
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.120]   of multiple. So, you know, like a five-cap rate is a 20 multiple. So interest rates drove
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.520]   multiples way down, and that drove prices and valuation way down. And now interest rates
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.240]   have, in my view, they've peaked, and we're going to see interest rates start to fall
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.880]   this year. And as they do, it's going to start driving real estate prices and multiples back
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.840]   up. Sure.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.480]   So in some ways, it's really simple. I mean, I honestly believe most investing actually
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.240]   is about trying to keep it simple. Right. And so back in August 2023,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.840]   I was a little bit more bullish, partly because I was in the hunt to buy another property.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.360]   But it seemed to me that inflation did peak already, right? 9.1% in, I think, June 2022.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.880]   It's been rolling over ever since. So back then, wouldn't it have been clear that eventually,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.720]   sooner or later, the Fed would cut rates? Therefore, nobody should be selling in 2023,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.840]   and people should be buying? Or is that just easy to talk about in hindsight now that Jerome Powell
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.280]   has specifically said, well, three rate cuts potentially in 2024?
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yeah, I think technically the bottom was October. And so in October, just to try to put us into the
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.560]   mindset we had then, there was a lot of talk about interest rates going essentially to 10%.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:08.280]   The Treasuries, they'd gone from 3.5% to 5% in about 90 to 100 days from August when we were
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.960]   talking to October, they went up, was equivalent to like 35%. And in that moment, people were
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.320]   arguing that there were so much supply of Treasuries coming to market, there was going to be
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   a lot of borrowing by the federal government, there's going to be huge deficits, and all of
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.280]   that would basically lead to higher interest rates because the market couldn't absorb
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.040]   that much new borrowing by the government. And so there was an expectation by part of the market
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.640]   that the long-term interest rate would go to six or seven, or even 10. And there were people out
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.400]   there talking about that. So it wasn't clear until November that that basically wasn't likely.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.880]   I didn't think that was likely either, but essentially, I can tell you why. As a result
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.080]   of that sort of uncertainty about the long-term rate, you had basically reluctant buyers because
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   you didn't want to buy a falling knife, and reluctant sellers because basically, they didn't
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:18.280]   want to sell into a market that they think would improve later. So there was a frozen market,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.840]   essentially zero transactions of consequence happened last year. It wasn't a good time to
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.480]   sell for sure. I don't think it was obvious in August that inflation and rates would basically
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:37.640]   be tamed by the end of 2023. Well, in terms of buying the bottom,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.280]   so that implies that sellers probably should not be selling at this time. What do you say to that?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.720]   And why would someone want to be selling at this time if we're really just off the bottom right now?
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.040]   Yeah. There is no willing seller. There's only forced sellers in the bottom. And so,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.240]   what's happened in the real estate market is that basically, a lot of borrowers borrowed
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.360]   too much money when rates were zero. And they basically have to either pay down their debt or
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.120]   sell. And that's inevitable. Those rates aren't going back to zero.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.480]   True. And so, the question is basically,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.960]   how long can they hold on? And what's happening is like a herd that slowly loses the weakest
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.400]   members of the pack and you sort of hunt it. The borrowers can only hold on so long.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.480]   And the two things that are happening is that there are borrowers who are capitulating
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:51.240]   and also buyers like us who look at the long-term rate and price and say, "Okay,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:59.720]   the gap is basically not so large as it would have been in October." And so, sellers and buyers have
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.960]   to meet somewhere in the middle. And that means if you're a buyer, you have to get
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.560]   a little bit aggressive. Everybody wants to buy at a price that makes them feel comfortable.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.080]   Normally, when you're buying something in a downturn, like I remember I bought something in
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.800]   2010 and I was freaked out. I just thought, "Oh my God, I can't believe I'm buying this thing
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   right now. It's so dangerous." And I looked back and I was like, "Oh my God, I stole it."
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.840]   So, during a downturn, emotionally, you feel fearful. And during an upswing, emotionally,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   you feel confident. And it's really ultimately the opposite of what's happening in reality.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.400]   Yeah, right. So, Ben, you just gave me an idea regarding using the cash in various
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   funds to take advantage of opportunities. So, for example, let's say you buy a distressed
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.080]   property deal, which you think is good from the flagship fund. Could you then support that deal
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.480]   with the cash from the income fund to try to make a better return for the income fund and support
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.520]   the deal for the flagship fund to make it a success later on? Or is this wonky thinking on my part?
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:13.080]   From a regulatory point of view, you have to be really careful crossing funds
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.520]   and/or co-investing. So, you can't have a perception or reality, but either can be
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.360]   problematic, of one fund bailing out the other. Even if you do it with good intentions, nobody
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.080]   presumes good intentions of anybody in the financial industry, which is largely right.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.840]   So, you can have funds investing shoulder to shoulder, side by side, same price, same terms.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:47.800]   But even that requires independent review, which you have to have independence to basically make
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:55.480]   sure that the transaction is kosher. So, it's challenging. You want to be careful and generally
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.960]   want to avoid excess complexity. Yeah. No, that makes sense. Thanks
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:06.440]   for clarifying that. So, Ben, what are your thoughts about office, big city office properties?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.280]   Because you see the big coastal cities like New York, San Francisco, office properties are getting
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:20.120]   sold for 50%, 60%, 70% down. To me, I'm thinking to myself, if there is a fund out there that is
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:26.520]   specifically looking at buying office property down 60%, 70%, whatever, 80%, I want to allocate
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.120]   some of that capital right now because I think in 10 years, 20 years, it could be worth much more.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   What are your thoughts on investing in that space and potentially starting a fund to invest in that
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.240]   space? Yeah. I've been waiting for the office
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:48.360]   market to really reprice and it actually hasn't repriced very much. I saw a transaction happen
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:56.280]   outside DC in Bethesda, which is the wealthiest part of the suburbs of Washington. And somebody
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.320]   had bought this 40-year-old building, but it had been fully renovated. It was purchased in 2019,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.880]   fully renovated, went into foreclosure and got purchased. And the difference was in 2019,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:17.400]   the price was $390 a square foot, plus they invested in renovating the building and bringing
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.680]   it up to kind of a modern standard. So they probably were into it for 450, I bet, maybe
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.120]   500 a square foot. And the new buyer bought it for $89 a square foot.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.760]   I mean, it's unbelievable. I mean, just that fact makes me salivate and want to buy.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.880]   Yeah. But is there potentially no upside to that?
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.920]   That one I think is interesting. I'm just trying to give a specific example of what makes it
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:47.560]   interesting and then what the risk might be. So it's near the metro, it's in Bethesda. And so if
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.680]   I think about it from a macro point of view, you sort of say, okay, well, you probably at this
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:10:00.760]   point, you want to be investing in sort of less urban neighborhoods actually, where you still have
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.120]   public transportation, but you're not going to worry in that instance about crime and the suburbs
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:12.520]   have seen a lot of growth as a result of work from home. So that deal actually was one of the
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.560]   first deals I saw where I thought like, that's probably a really good deal. Mostly I haven't
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.720]   seen transactions that deep a discount in that good a location. And so you really have to be
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.000]   pretty deeply discounted, I think, before it becomes attractive, because the problem you have
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.120]   with office is that it's a vicious cycle. This is the danger of investing in distress, is that
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:47.400]   distress can get more distressed. It's like when Sam Zell bought the Tribune because he
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:55.560]   thought it was a distressed newspaper and then it just went bankrupt. How much risk are you
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.640]   actually taking I think can be tricky because over the next probably decade, you're going to see
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:10.600]   deterioration in office space. And so you'd have to be getting a really good discount. You have
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.120]   to be getting the right property in the right location. And I think it's still early, super
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.400]   early. I mean, I think we have half a decade, sort of like the mall industry. I mean, it's still
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   dying and it hasn't died yet. You're just such a long downturn. I mean, malls have been dying since
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:37.080]   the introduction of e-commerce 20 years ago. And I think of e-commerce in 1997 versus now,
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.280]   think about work from home now versus what it's going to be like in 10, 20 years.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.920]   We're going to see a lot more change, virtual reality, 3D, AI, and it's just going to continue
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:55.240]   to eat away at office. It is getting interesting, but it's not clear. I don't think it's at the
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.040]   bottom with some exceptions. Yeah. No, that makes sense. I mean,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.840]   if I put on my economist hat, could I say that the destruction in office property wealth
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.760]   can simply be shifted towards the value creation of residential property wealth
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.440]   because more people are permanently going to be working from home longer? Could that
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:26.200]   be a simple thesis? And if so, does that mean residential will permanently see an uptick in
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.360]   value for, I don't know, as long as we shall live? Well, I mean, I'm hesitant to say permanently,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.640]   but I think that the parallel between e-commerce and work from home is there. And so just to
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.120]   put a finer point on it, right? So retail and malls were just devastated by e-commerce and
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:50.360]   industrial was the beneficiary because industrial was not an institutional asset class back before
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.000]   e-commerce. And what happened was every three square feet of retail you lost, you picked up
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.400]   one square foot of industrial. And obviously Amazon got a lot of the economics too. So it
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:09.000]   wasn't one for one. So maybe a third of the value that was destroyed was picked up by industrial.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.320]   So I think that some ratio like that exists for residential too. And as office loses a trillion
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:23.240]   dollars in value or maybe more, residential picks up something pretty significant. And so it's
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.280]   my experience buying in real estate and also in tech is that it's much easier making money when
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:38.520]   the tailwind, when the macro's behind you, pushing you, helping you. And it's really
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.120]   challenging to make money when it's against you, when the wind's at your face. There's things that
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.000]   are really hurting. I was in the retail business. I actually have a decent experience in it.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:57.160]   And so you just have to work a lot harder. And I'm not sure the return, let's say if you can get
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:05.320]   teens or even greater return in residential, how much more are you getting for buying office?
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.360]   You're not going to get that much more. And you're just taking... Because the problem is
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:17.480]   the other side of that is where's your liquidity? Who's the buyer? I have a friend who went to work
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:26.360]   for TV news. He was a TV news professional in 1999 and his career just never... 20 years later,
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:33.320]   he got out of TV news because the ratings only went down his whole career. My experience with
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.200]   macro is all things being equal, you definitely want it at your back, not at your face.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:45.160]   Right. No, that makes sense. That totally makes sense. In terms of price forecasting,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.840]   what I found interesting is in 2023, if you look at the St. Louis Fed data, it shows the median
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:57.480]   home price is down 8% as of third quarter 2023. And maybe it'll only be down 5% once the fourth
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.040]   quarter data comes out. But then you look at the Freddie Mac index and the Case-Shiller index,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:09.400]   and it says the median home price is up 2% to 3.5%. So I guess two questions for you. One,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:16.120]   which index do you believe and where do you think or how much did home prices increase or decrease
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:22.840]   in 2023? Single family homes is like a non-institutional business. It's home buyers
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.760]   want to live there. So it's a consumer product actually. And I don't really think either is
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:35.000]   probably correct. It's probably some mix of the two. I think generally what people saw was that
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.400]   prices didn't fall very much and sometimes they went up a little. And so 8% down seems
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:48.040]   high to me from the Fed data. But at the end of the day, I think that my takeaway is that
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.560]   home prices didn't fall, which I basically was pretty sure I was saying at the time. I didn't
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:16:00.360]   think they were going to fall. They didn't fall because the way homes are priced is based on
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:07.080]   supply and demand. And when rates went up, there was no supply of existing homes to market because
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.440]   no one wanted to sell a home with a 3% locked in mortgage. And so there was undersupply of housing
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:21.720]   available for sale and that kept prices up. So I think that the risky look at pricing is the primary
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:28.520]   stat when you're thinking about value. 2021 should have proven that out for anybody who is an
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:36.280]   investor. Right. And so in 2024, do you think there will be an increase in demand more than
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.160]   the increase in supply? Therefore, prices will go up. And if you believe that, how much do you
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.400]   think prices can go up in 2024? We're talking about for housing and for institutional real
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.760]   estate because I'm much more in the weeds of institutional real estate than single family
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.800]   consumer housing. Right. Let's talk about institutional real estate where investors can
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.000]   benefit from what Fundrise invests in. I don't think of it in terms of like a 12-month
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.960]   cycle. I think of it in terms of like you're buying a price and usually you look at price
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:14.440]   based on a price per square foot or price per pound. Like the office building, $89 a square
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.960]   foot. Well, that seems like a good price, right? You don't even know what the yield is on that
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.560]   office building. It might be terrible. It might be attractive. Buying yield in 2021 was a mistake,
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:31.400]   right? Because interest rates were so low. Yields were pushing prices up. Today is the opposite.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:38.360]   Interest rates are a lot higher and that's pushing the price down. So I look at the price per square
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.080]   foot and say, "Okay. Well, I'd much rather buy a depressed price per square foot even if it
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.640]   looks like the yield is not as good as it was in 2021." So anyways, just to get at your question,
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.920]   real estate multiples or real estate cap rates, they fell 50% in the last 18 months because
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.880]   interest rates went from zero to five and a quarter or five, you know, or so. Or if you
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:11.000]   think about it like all in, you could borrow at 3% or less during 2020, 2021 and then now you have
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.360]   to borrow at six or 7%. So interest rates basically doubled. That's why cap rates fell 50%.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.120]   I don't think interest rates are going back to zero. They probably end up halfway in between
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:27.640]   where they were and where they are. I almost call it 2.5%. That'd be 2.65% or something halfway in
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.400]   between. So that would basically mean that you have multiples could increase by 25%. They still
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.200]   fell 50% and you get back half of it just on normalizing interest rates. You should have 25%
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:47.240]   potential gains in movement in rates. And that doesn't include natural growth from
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:56.040]   rents or from buying something really cheap or renovations or things like that or income.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:05.560]   You buy a property that has a 5% income, you get that too. So if I think about returns, I stack
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:13.000]   them in three ways. You look at your income and that might be typically 5% to 8% on a stabilized
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.720]   property. You look at your rent growth or inflation and let's say that's historically been 3%. So you
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:27.080]   end up with like a 8% to 12% return there, something like that. And then if cap rates can
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:34.280]   move 25%, you know, over say two years, that gets you to a pretty good total return.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.720]   That's how I would think about it.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.680]   Okay. It's interesting how you think about it versus how maybe like just the average
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.960]   retail investor thinks about it. Because for us, we think, well, how much is my home going to go
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.200]   up in one year or how much is my asset, right? Year over year growth. And from your perspective,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:58.520]   there's multiple combination of factors and it's a longer term perspective. So I guess,
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.680]   you know, as an investor, let's say the property, there's no interest rate change,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:12.840]   so no cap rate change. The only thing that changes is rent growth. So just trying to
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.600]   understand this. So let's say rent growth is 5% for this one complex properties.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:24.120]   How much does the NAV of that property change in the fund?
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.680]   Yeah. So if you had a property, like an apartment building, let's say had
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   free cashflow or income of 5% and then you had rent growth of 5%, you would look at that and say,
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:42.200]   "Well, that's a total return of 10%." And then the NAV would pick up the 5%
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.960]   in appreciation and the dividends would pick up the 5% in income.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.360]   Okay. So it would be exactly how it is. Like if there's 5% rent growth,
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.840]   let's say there is no appreciation in terms of like no change in cap rate, it's 5%.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:02.760]   Yeah. Because the income went up 5%. It's sort of like, if you think about a company,
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.920]   if their earnings grow 5%, right? And their multiple doesn't change,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.160]   then their stock price would go up sort of commensurately.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:17.000]   Right. Got it. Okay. I think that's helpful for investors and listeners. So what I've gathered
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.320]   from this is, well, rates go down, cap rates go down. Over a two-year period,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.400]   it sounds like we could see eight to mid-teens growth.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.640]   I mean, it's not going to happen linearly.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.360]   Sure.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.880]   Most change happens non-linearly. Sorry, not to get too philosophical, but we experience time
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.040]   in a linear way, but actually most change happens in these sort of catalytic ways where
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:52.840]   the market recognized in November that inflation was coming down and it just shifted by 20,
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   25% in 60 days. So I believe that's going to happen in fits and starts and there'll be moments
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:11.080]   of fear along the way. But yeah, that's my view is that there's a lot of room for rates to come
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.000]   down, multiples to normalize and prices to follow.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.960]   Right. Well, it's interesting in the last couple months of 2023, you saw bond prices increase,
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:30.280]   10-year treasury bond yields go down to like 3.8%, stock market rally. I feel like maybe we're
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:36.120]   getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. We've pulled in a lot of growth based on a huge rally
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:43.000]   in the end of 2023. And now you're seeing the 10-year bond yield go back up to back up to almost
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.240]   4% again. What are your expectations for the number of Fed funds rate cuts this year? And
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.120]   where do you see the 10-year bond yield finishing at the end of this year? It's currently at almost
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.320]   4% again.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.160]   I don't normally think that way. It's the whole Ray Dalio,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.960]   I'd rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.480]   So whatever number I tell you is going to be precisely wrong on December 31st, 2024.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:16.600]   But I think approximately right is that rates are coming down. I don't think there's much
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:25.080]   debate about that. I think that the economy is still slowing, that high rates are slowing the
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.960]   economy and it's going to slow inflation and that may actually hurt the stock market because growth
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:37.880]   is going to slow for a lot of companies. And it's like an interesting thing where the stock market's
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.960]   near the 2021 peak and real estate's pricing at 50% or huge discount, whatever you want to call
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:50.680]   it, 20 to 50% discount. So that seems to me like an opportunity in private markets where the public
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.360]   markets seem like they... Yeah, they do seem like they got ahead of themselves, but it just depends
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.520]   on your horizon. I think two years from now, we're going to look back and say that's like
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:06.360]   too high a price, probably not. But six months from now, we get probably so.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.280]   Yeah. No, I like that saying. I haven't heard that saying. Yeah, at the end of the day,
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.600]   we're just making predictions, but we've got to operate our investments
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:20.440]   somewhat based on our predictions. Otherwise, we're being incongruent with thought and action.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   I'm pretty bullish on 2024, which makes me kind of hesitant. Every time I get bulled up,
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.840]   I'm thinking, "What am I missing? What could go wrong?" I mean, it seems like maybe
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.240]   inflation could pick back up. I mean, I was at the gas station the other day and I was like, "What?
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.600]   Gas is back up to $5.40 a gallon. Natural gas prices for your home is probably back up."
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   I'm thinking, "Oh, no. Hopefully, inflation doesn't go back up like it did in the 1970s.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:50.200]   Then it's going to be higher rates for longer." Do you have any of those type of fears that
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.280]   inflation could be kicking back up again in 2024? I mean, I've been fairly consistent about this and
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.880]   I've been wrong so far, but I basically believe that inevitably high rates and quantitative
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:08.360]   tightening will materially slow the economy. I think it's happening as we speak. The Fed will
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:16.280]   be reluctant to drop rates soon enough. I think the biggest risk is on the downside where we end up
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:24.440]   with recession, not that we end up with inflation high forever or coming back. I think the Fed is,
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.680]   if you look at which error they're likely to make and they're likely to cut too much or cut too
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.760]   little, I think it's that they're likely to cut too little because of the whole institutional
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:39.320]   momentum behind their fear of repeating what happened in the 1970s. My view is basically,
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.000]   that's why I think the stock market is potentially a little bit ahead of its skis because
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.320]   if growth slows, then earnings growth, which are currently forecasted to be pretty decent,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.640]   I think it'll be like 13.5%, if that slows, then basically that's going to be a problem for the
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:04.040]   market. Conversely, a recession would be bullish for real estate because it brings interest rates
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.800]   down and interest rates pulled down are much more consequential than profit growth.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.720]   Just to put some math on that. As you said, let's say that normal profit growth or rent growth is
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:27.160]   3% to 5% in real estate. I just said that multiples fell 50%. Take you a decade plus
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:33.240]   in profit growth at 3% to 5% a year to get back what you lost in multiples.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.440]   If there's no change in rates.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:42.120]   Yeah. Well, just to normalize, what's the bigger driver of returns, multiple compression or
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:48.920]   expansion or profit growth is clearly cap rate compression. My point is that if there's a
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:55.960]   recession, profit growth for potentially everything slows down, but that won't matter as much to real
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:03.080]   estate as the decline in interest rates. Got it. No, that makes a lot of sense. In a way,
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.800]   real estate investors might be rooting for a recession because it would force the Fed's hand
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.560]   to cut rates faster, sooner, and more than expected. Right now, the expectations are for
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:21.960]   three rate cuts, maybe 25 basis points each, bring down the Fed funds rate to 4.5, 4.75,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.120]   which is still quite restrictive if inflation stays at 3%. That is restrictive.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.760]   I'm of the belief that the Fed is going to cut more than three times and we can revisit this
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.520]   at the end of the year and that would bring more fuel or support the real estate market further.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:47.960]   Yeah. Hold on. I have two things I want to debate with you. First, just let me go to the point about
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:55.880]   bad news is good news. I mean, for the last year, slowing economy has been a point of rallying for
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:03.720]   the stock market. The bad news is good news cycle, I think, has driven down inflation and driven up
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:09.160]   the stock market. But at some point, bad news becomes bad news. That's basically what I'm
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:16.120]   saying. A recession or a forecast around slowing growth is that actually bad news is not good news
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.560]   at some point. I think that when that shifts, the stock market could have a bit of a problem.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:29.320]   Then your second point about rooting for the market to fall is definitely real estate industry
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.640]   and all these borrowers who have a problem extending their loans. They're rooting for
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   a return to the 2010s. 2010s in terms of rates or prices?
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:47.240]   Both. It's a great decade for real estate. Yeah. Well, the way I think about it,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.840]   I think about myself as a capital allocator. I look at asset classes that performed over the
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:58.760]   trailing 12 months. I look at asset classes that have underperformed over the past 12 months. I
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:04.120]   try to allocate more capital to the underperformers when there's a historical correlation with
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:12.120]   performance. We know real estate outperformed before 2023, but real estate underperformed in
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:19.640]   2023 to the S&P 500 because S&P 500 was up 24%. Real estate was pretty sluggish. Depending on
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.560]   which index you follow, down 5% to up 3.5%, 4%. That's big underperformance for that year.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:32.040]   I'm expecting a normalization of performance. That spread can't be that wide for that long.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.640]   There's so much liquidity on the sidelines looking performance. When I look at the S&P 500 at 47.50,
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.480]   I'm thinking, "Well, it's kind of fully valid in my opinion." I'd rather be plowing money into
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.520]   real estate at this point because I think there's better diversification and more upside potential.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:58.600]   Right. You're saying the same thing I'm trying to say. You're just saying it in a stock market or
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:05.800]   like a RIA language. Yes, that's exactly what I'm trying to say too. My view is
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:12.920]   totally aligned with what you just articulated. This is great. I think this is the first time
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.840]   in several years that we're totally aligned, which actually, again, makes me kind of worried.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:26.200]   I'm like a promo optimist. I'm a realist too, but man, we're totally aligned. Okay.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.360]   Let me just say it because I've been a perma bear for the last couple of years
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:39.080]   and you were an optimist. Now, I'm an optimist and you're an optimist.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.880]   I'm still an optimist.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.680]   You're still an optimist.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:49.320]   All right. Well, I'll tell you what. Let's wrap up this episode here. It was great talking about
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:55.560]   real estate. In an upcoming episode, let's talk about the Fundrise Innovation Fund and
