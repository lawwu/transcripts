[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   But before we get into all of that, I want to do a quick
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   deep life
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.480]   slow productivity themed
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.480]   reaction and
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.500]   In particular the the article I want to react to here is my own
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.560]   So I published this just on my my newsletter
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.880]   yesterday July 5th the day before we were
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.840]   recording this episode and this is based off of a
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.640]   Article that many different readers sent to my interesting at cal Newport comm email address
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.720]   All right, so the title of this of this article
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.880]   It's I wrote for my newsletter and if you don't subscribe to that newsletter cal Newport comm you should it's once a week
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.200]   I've been doing it since 2007. All right, so the title I had for the article was the three-hour
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.880]   Fields metal little Tim Ferriss nod
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.000]   Colon a slow productivity case study, but really what I'm doing here is reacting to this article and again if you're listening
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.920]   I'm showing this on the screen
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.440]   So if you watch the episode at youtube.com slash cal Newport media, you'll you'll see what I'm talking about, but I'll walk you through it
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820]   This essay was in reaction to this profile from quantum magazine
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760]   about
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.000]   June
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   Huh? Huhu a June is 39 year old Princeton professor
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   Why we care about him is that yesterday he was awarded the
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.640]   2022
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.440]   Fields medal this is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of mathematics. It's given out once every four years, I believe
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   it's given out to the
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.040]   mathematical professional
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.400]   40 or younger whose work done to date and promise for future work is the let's say most impressive among all
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.240]   Working mathematicians. So it's really one of the highest honors you can win
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.560]   in
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.080]   Mathematics and he won it for work. He's doing on geometric combinatorics
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.660]   All right. So this profile which was quite long quantum magazine is great
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.880]   This profile is quite long had some interesting points in it. So for example, if you look at
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.000]   June's
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.680]   Trajectory, he did not get serious about mathematics until late in his undergraduate career. He went to
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520]   College University in South Korea where it's a six-year system
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.400]   It wasn't till his sixth year that he even got serious about mathematics and that's because he took a class from a well-known
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.120]   Eccentric Fields Prize winning Fields medal winning mathematician Japanese mathematician. Hey, Suki
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.080]   Hironaka who was teaching a class where it wasn't
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.440]   Well established results. He was actually teaching stuff. He was working on June falls under his sway
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.760]   Applies to graduate school. He's applying to graduate school having only been serious about math for one year
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.880]   So he applies for around a dozen schools. Everyone rejects them except for one Urbana-Champaign lets him in
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.720]   They're glad they did because within a year or two he solved Reed's conjecture. So he immediately solves a 40 year
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   40 year open problem
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.520]   for the
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   nerds out there
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.400]   You can you can bound the chromatic number of graphs with certain characteristic
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.720]   polynomials the chromatic number of
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.400]   Undirected graph being the minimum number of colors by which you can color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.720]   All of my hopefully all my algorithms and discrete mathematics students know what I'm talking about here
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.080]   You can bound the chromatic number with a polynomial the polynomial has coefficients the coefficients of these characteristic
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.520]   polynomials have certain properties that had long been observed such as their log concavity, but it had never been proved that that was
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.760]   unavoidable
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.700]   Reed's conjecture said it was June proved it
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.080]   All right. So there you go. There's a summary of the first thing he proved
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.800]   He then went on to generalize those results to something called matroids blah blah blah long story short
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.320]   It was it's a very innovative approach that showed that I mean again, I don't know how to summarize this
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.400]   Too succinctly but but essentially a technique that before
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.160]   people thought only applied to problems where there is a
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.400]   Geometric grounding like the chromatic number of a graph. He showed you could apply this technique to a much broader
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.280]   Class of objects called matrix. Let's just
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.400]   Let's just leave it at that. Anyways, it won him a Fields Medal. It was a really good result
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.520]   I also found that interesting that after he solved Reed's conjecture the schools who had rejected him
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.400]   Came back and courted him. U Michigan actually convinced him to transfer from Urbana-Champaign to Michigan after he solved Reed's conjecture
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.680]   So they they sort of realized they made a mistake on that one
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.360]   anyways, the reason why I
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.820]   Wanted to talk about this profile of this young professor was the following quote
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.240]   That came from the profile on any given day. Poe does about
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   three hours of focused work
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.080]   He might think about a math problem or prepare to lecture a classroom of students or schedule a doctor's appointment for his two sons
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   Then I'm exhausted
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.920]   He says doing something that's valuable meaningful creative or a task that he doesn't particularly want to do like sketching those appointments
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.520]   Takes away a lot of your energy
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.120]   This guy's doing productive work about three hours a day
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.920]   Not even just three hours of deep work on math and I do the rest of the stuff later in the day
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   He spends about three hours a day
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.000]   actually
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   exhausting energy from his mind
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.280]   Now I thought that was really telling because it provides an extreme example of one of these principles
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.120]   That is a part of my emerging philosophy of slow productivity
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.680]   And that principle is that busyness and exhaustion that sense of overload and frenetic
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.960]   Movement is often quite unrelated
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   to producing valuable work
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.000]   These are two unrelated things the the pace and effort required to do things of note
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.840]   to prove things about
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.320]   matroids or to solve Reed's conjecture
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.000]   Those efforts do not require and have very little to do with I am overloaded. I'm burnt out
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.920]   I'm burning the midnight oil. I am working all day long. I'm frantic. I'm frenetic
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.560]   to unrelated
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.000]   to unrelated states a
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   little bit of intense work
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.280]   done at a natural pace
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.360]   Given the breathing room to aggregate over time can lead to really big results
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.080]   So that got me thinking
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.360]   Why are we then in so many roles, especially even specialized knowledge worker roles?
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.320]   We're producing complex things out of our minds is ultimately what moves the needle
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.040]   Why in so many of these roles are we so busy and why are we so overloaded?
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.600]   And I think there's two different things going on here
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.440]   One is I talk about a lot on the show and in my writing the way we organize work
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.480]   Especially knowledge work today is haphazard
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.680]   Anyone can grab anyone's attention at any time. We have no sort of systematic thinking about workload
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.080]   We have no systematic thinking about collaboration or communication how this should actually unfold
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.000]   It is a free-for-all of obligation hot potato where everyone's just shooting things off to everyone else
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.840]   You put something on my plate. I send you a clarifying question
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   So I don't have to worry about it for a couple hours
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.400]   Something pops up. I say why don't you handle this?
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.280]   It's a world without specialization where we say why can't everyone just handle all of the various administrative logistical tasks that are relevant to them?
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.160]   Because then we don't have to hire support staff. It's a chaotic haphazard world
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:38.580]   And that creates overload that creates busyness the second reason why we feel that is uh, we don't have a good definition of productivity
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.880]   So we we create this new world of work
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.360]   Create this new world of work in which you're using your mind instead of building things
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.440]   With your hands. So we have to think what does productivity mean and i'm talking now mid 20th century
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.160]   What does productivity mean if we're not counting?
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.600]   The time required to produce a model t
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.000]   What does it mean? Well, we leaned into industrial metaphors. Why well, where were the first big?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   Offices, where were the first big collections of hundreds or thousands of people in the same place doing work with their mind and not their
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.080]   Hands, it was the front offices of large
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.400]   industrial corporations the early 20th century you get the rise of the mega corporation you get the
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Efficiencies of scale of acquiring competitors and building up very large companies this this this idea of the very large company
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.600]   Emerges in the early 20th century. We we see it
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.200]   Uh with the the robber barons the late 19th century early 20th century by the 1940s you have, you know
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.760]   General motors as this massive consolidated company that has all these different verticals
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.280]   Well that requires a huge amount of administrative support. They were all put into the same big buildings there
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   You have the first big knowledge worker
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.540]   Setting so of course when the same ceo that is overlooking
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.280]   700 clerical workers administrative workers and managers
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.000]   is also overlooking
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.160]   industrial assembly lines
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.480]   We're going to adopt by default
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.340]   industrial productivity metrics
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.740]   effort time spent working
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.140]   Uh minimizing idleness the things you would care about with an assembly line
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:22.620]   So we have adopted sort of by default these industrial metrics and then as we begin to get some separation
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.260]   We get the rise of knowledge work that's completely
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:31.040]   Disconnected from industrial production. We do have a chance to try to evolve our understanding of productivity
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:38.140]   But then we get the computer revolution and it completely shakes up the whole proverbial snow globe. Suddenly we have networks and email
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.700]   And everything gets thrown up into the air again
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:46.060]   All these revolutions sort of get in the way the disruption gets in the way of maturity and stabilization of work philosophy
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.260]   So we end up where we are today with this weird mix of industrial notions of productivity that's based around
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.980]   You're a worker on an assembly line. And uh, if you're idle that's wasted money
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.620]   I want you to be here for set hours and doing those hours
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:06.300]   I want to see activity that mixed in with the haphazard freneticism of uncontrolled digital communication and we get this weird world we have today
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.860]   So we have these notions of productivity around I can't see you're working. You're not
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.420]   Productive maybe you're you know, something's going on. You're screwing me, you know idleness
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.460]   And so we want you to be working for these hours
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.540]   we want to see that you're working if you're not going to be in the office and we want to see that you're responding to
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.380]   slack and email because
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.500]   Activity is value inactivity is wasted value very old notion. So we need new notions of
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.220]   How do you productively create value in a skilled cognitive environment?
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.520]   And that's where something like slow productivity is trying to fill a void. Let us evolve our notion of productivity
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.700]   Away from what you would want with factory workers and towards something that actually makes sense
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.540]   For people trying to add value to information using their mind
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.660]   So it's an extreme example three hours a day
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.620]   And you have a fields medal by 39
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.040]   But the extremes are often great for highlighting the underlying realities
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.720]   Busyness and overload is unrelated
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.500]   to producing things
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   that actually matter
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.220]   Three-hour fields medal
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.460]   I saw something jesse. No, I forgot who it was. I think a reader sent it to me
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.100]   It was a writer
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.300]   who
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.540]   Has simplified their writing down to one day a week
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420]   Really? Yeah, and they're a pretty productive writer
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.140]   It's a non-fiction
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.400]   I forgot exactly what space he's in but just one day a week. He writes I think it's thursdays
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.180]   And over time he's built up this like really nice collection of books that he's written
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.060]   I mean again overload busyness that sense of like I don't have enough time
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.780]   if anything gets in the way of
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.180]   Producing stuff that matters not that not the recipe for it
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.180]   You like writing every day though, don't you? I do i've been writing in the morning
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.980]   We we finally have all the different uh workmen out of our study
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.940]   And my desk isn't there yet, but there's a table in there
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.420]   And so I go in there each morning and that's where i've been writing. So like two hours a day
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.740]   I'm trying to two to three. Yeah, I mean i'm making progress on here's my quick writing update
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.140]   If you're interested i'm working now in my slow productivity book that i'm writing
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.060]   On the the principle about doing fewer things
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.940]   Looking like this is going to come in at a 15
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.140]   15 to 20k word section
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.860]   So there's these three big sections one for each of the principles and they're going to be pretty big maybe about 15 000 words each
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.620]   and
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.860]   I've been stuck for a little while on this
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.780]   Particular section and I feel like I have some traction going and so that's what i've been working on
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.380]   When I was on my trip, I was getting unstuck which means
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.620]   figuring out
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.340]   What is my path through this particular section? What are the examples? How do I want to streamline this?
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.060]   I did not I was trying to force what I had before to work and I had cognitive friction
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.420]   I knew it wasn't working the the examples I wanted to use when I dive deeper into the source material weren't what I wanted
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.740]   Didn't seem like it's what I needed
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:06.140]   And over this trip to Tennessee, I I reworked it. I streamlined and now it's rolling now it's rolling
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.300]   So i'm not far into the section i'm writing, but I have forward momentum
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.060]   So so hopefully i'll finish that up this week when you do your weekly plan
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.860]   When you do your weekly plan, do you map out like
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.220]   What you're going to write about each day like for instance because you have your new yorker stuff you have your books you have
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.260]   Yeah, I have to figure that out. Yeah, I mean that's that's what happened
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:31.660]   I'm in a confusing writing landscape right now because I was I've been working on this big principle of the book
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.620]   Then I shifted over
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:40.700]   to a magazine piece new yorker piece that was going to serve double duty as a
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.820]   Piece for the new yorker, but also for a chapter earlier in the book
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.100]   Then something else came along
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.980]   And it was sort of more of a topical article. I said, yeah, I want to short. Let me write that
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:59.020]   So like all of that got put on pause so I could I wanted to write a shorter sort of topical piece
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.540]   um
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.540]   And that was like the week before my trip
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.780]   So everything got put on pause for that finish that that's an editing and when I came back
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.060]   Now i'm close enough to finishing this principle
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.380]   That i'm i'm going to do that and then turn back to finishing
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.140]   The original piece i'm working on the details here
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:26.320]   Not that important the bigger point being uh, jesse's right to ask about that. It's a complicated picture i'm sort of concurrent
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.060]   Writing things and moving around what am I going to work on now put this on side put this on hold now?
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.000]   So I write this it's not always an obvious formula how you make those decisions
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.060]   And and it's something that requires some thought like right now the way i'm thinking about it is because i'm in
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.980]   Editing with this one
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:47.180]   Uh magazine piece. I don't want to work on another magazine piece while i'm editing a current one
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.900]   It's it too close to home. We're going to cross the circuit
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.540]   So that's why I while i'm editing this piece. I want to write
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.060]   It's essentially more of an advice-y type section of my book, which is quite different
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.060]   So these are the type of chess pieces you move around
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.980]   Um, yeah, but at the weekly planning stage i'm thinking what am I writing this week?
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.380]   Where am I going to try to get and then and what I like to?
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.660]   I like to get to the point where I can see a milestone
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.940]   Coming up because then you can go after it like oh
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.060]   I want to get there by this weekend
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.580]   Then you'll add extra hours and really push and and when you're in the stages where you're
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.780]   Planning and trying to make something work. You can feel like days are going by
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   And not much progress is happening
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.780]   But then when you start to see you have 5 000 words away from wrapping this whole thing up
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.820]   You see that finish line, then you can really lock in
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.060]   And it can be pretty you get these really productive locked in sessions
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.620]   But anyways, that's all just to give the impression of the writing life can be more complicated
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.020]   It seems simple, but it can be complicated figuring out
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.820]   What I should be writing now
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.060]   Is is not always obvious
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.000]   (upbeat music)
