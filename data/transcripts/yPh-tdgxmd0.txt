[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Thank God that we can sing words like that in a world like this.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   And let us now try to find some further reasons why we can do so,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   and why it is possible for all to do so,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   if they but believe the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I call your attention once more, therefore, to the words
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   that are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Galatians in chapter 6
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   and in verse 14, the 14th verse, in the 6th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   "But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Now that is the very essence of the Christian message, the Christian gospel.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And I am particularly glad to think tonight that we are calling attention to this
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and considering it together.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   There is no hope for this world apart from this gospel.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And the essence of this gospel is this message about the cross.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   The apostle says that he glories in it because it is by this, by which, by whom, by which,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   he has been set free and has become the man that he is.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Now this is his own personal statement, his own personal confession.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He is a man who once used to boast in many other things, but he says,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "Now I boast in nothing save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   This had become to him the most important thing in his life, in all his thinking.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   He counts this above everything else.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   There were other people who were interested in other things,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   people going round the churches after him, false teachers,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   trying to get credit and popularity for themselves and even making money out of it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   "All right," says the apostle, "let them go on and carry on if they like.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   They glory in the flesh, but God forbid that I should glory
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Well now then, I am putting it to you like this,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   as I have been putting it on a number of Sunday nights already.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   This is the test of any profession of Christianity that we may have.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The Christian not only believes in the cross, he glories in it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He sees what happened there on the cross on Calvary's Hill
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   as the most important thing that has ever happened.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He sees there the turning point of all history, as that hymn has just been putting it.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   "In the cross of Christ I glory, towering o'er the wrecks of time."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   This is God's history, this is the pivotal event.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   This is the event of all events that has ever happened
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   in the whole long history of the human race.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And nothing therefore is so vitally important as that we should understand what it means.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   What is this cross of Christ?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   What's its significance?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   What's it got to say to us tonight?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   What is its message to the world?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   We've been singing that hymn in which another man gives his confession.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That's what he found in the cross.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Whatever his mood or state or condition, the cross sanctified it all.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Pain or pleasure, whatever was happening to him, the cross always speaks.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's the apostle's position.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   He glories in this because he has discovered that whatever is happening to him,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   this is the message that always is with him and turns everything to his advantage and to his glory.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So he makes his boast in the cross.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Now we've been examining these various things that the apostle here
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and in various other places in his writings tells us about the cross.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Why does he glory in the cross?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Well, I say he glories in the cross because he sees there in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   the most wonderful person that this world has ever seen,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   the most wonderful act that the world has ever seen.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Here is one who was crucified by the world.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It had no reason whatsoever for doing so, but he had come deliberately to die.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That wasn't an accident.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   That wasn't an assassination.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   That was this deliberate murder by the world in its blindness and ignorance,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   but he had come to do it.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   He had come to die.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And there we see the most amazing and wonderful spectacle that the world has ever seen.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   my richest gain I count but loss and poor contempt.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   On all my pride, there's nothing like it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And when a man truly sees the Son of God there dying and doing so deliberately
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   for a world that had never known him and didn't understand him,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   a world that was rejecting him, there's nothing I say beyond that.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   All your drama, all your moving stories and novels about men making sacrifices,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   all the great epics of history, they pale into insignificance by the sight of this,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, and then the glory of God the Father.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   My dear friend, God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It's God who did it.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   He sent his Son into this world in order to die,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   that you and I might become his children forgiven and restored.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And then we've seen how the cross separates a man,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   delivers him from the world, this present evil world.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   What an evil world it is.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It is also that which delivers him, we've seen,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   from the clutches and the tyranny of the devil, the adversary of men.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   But still we haven't finished.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   "God forbid that I should glory," says the apostle,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   "save in the cross." There's no end to it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's such a tremendous thing.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So I move forward tonight to call your attention to one further reason
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   which the apostle has for glorying in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   What's that? Well, here it is.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It is the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   that alone can produce true unity amongst men.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now it's to that I want to call your attention.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And what a night on which to call your attention to that.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The apostle gloried in the cross, and every true Christian does,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   because it is the only power in the world that can ever bring men and women together
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   and make them one and give a real unity and a real peace.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Everybody's mind tonight is engaged on this whole question
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   of how to produce unity in the world.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   The assassination of the late President Kennedy
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   pinpoints that in a very acute manner for us.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I'm not going to preach on President Kennedy,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   but it would be madness not to see what that terrible event,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   that awful event, should make us all think about.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   There was a man who was struggling and striving in various ways
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   to bring men and women together.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   There are those who would say that he met his death
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   because he was trying to solve the problem of integration in the United States.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Black, white, colored, non-colored, how to bring them together,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   how to bring an end to segregation, and how to produce integration.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It was certainly one of the problems with which he was struggling.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   He went to Texas because he was concerned about it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   The problem of the two groupings of the nations of the world,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   the iron curtain between them.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He was striving, he was struggling with this problem
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   of how to bring together these two warring factions
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   of human nature and of the humankind.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   There was a man who gave his life and his activity
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   to that very question, to that very matter.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And I have no doubt that it is true to say that in many ways
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   he met his death because of these things.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Very well, we are concerned then with this problem.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   We are in a world which is full of tension, full of division,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   full of strife, full of the danger of war.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   We are in a world that is divided up hopelessly.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And there is all this unhappiness and all this pain.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   The Bible has always said that this world is an evil world.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Nothing else says that. The newspapers don't say that.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   The newspapers regard an event such as this which has happened as exceptional.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's only exceptional in one sense, that it happens to be unusually dramatic.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   But the world is full of that kind of thing.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That's the sort of world we are living in.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   The world seems shocked because of the unexpected.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's not unexpected, it's not unusual.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   This is this present evil world.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I'm not exaggerating this particular thing.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I have my own views with regard to whoever may have committed this dastardly crime.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But I'm here to say that this is but one of the manifestations of a strife,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   a warfare, an antagonism, a bitterness and a hatred.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   It's just a particularly ugly manifestation of it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   But the thing itself belongs to a whole category,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   which is our less the cause of our greatest troubles in this world this evening.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And that is why I'm calling attention to this.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Now I want to look at it not only in terms of the world's situation,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   but also in terms of our individual lives.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   One of the greatest fallacies today is that we draw a too sharp a distinction
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   between the individual and the mass,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   between nations and persons, individuals.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   A nation is nothing after all but individuals, a collection of individuals.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   A nation is nothing but the individual writ large.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   The world is a sort of macrocosm of which man is a microcosm.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And what is true of the nations of the world tonight is true of individuals,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   individuals within the nations, groupings, divisions within all the nations,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and even divisions and groupings and antagonisms and tensions,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   even in yet smaller units, even in families.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Division, strife, disagreement, misunderstanding.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   But we can take it even further.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   How many in this congregation tonight know perfect rest?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   How many know real peace and quiet?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Isn't there a warfare going on within you?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Isn't there a strife and a tension?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Isn't there a conflict?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Well, it is. We are all born like that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   We are born creatures of conflict within, without, in the whole realm,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   in every realm and department of life.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And what I want to try to show you tonight is this,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   that there is only one thing in the whole world at this moment
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   that can deal with this warfare and tension and strife.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   It is the cross of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Now, you noticed we read at the beginning of the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And you noticed what the apostle had got to say there.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's not surprising that he gloried in the cross,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   because the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ had done what he regarded as
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   the most wonderful and amazing thing that he had ever known.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   What was that?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Well, it had produced the Christian church.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Why is this so wonderful?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Well, it is wonderful for this reason,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   that together, side by side in the Christian church,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   there were Jews and Gentiles.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Now, that was the thing that the apostle could never get over.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   You remember that the ancient world was divided up into Jews and all the rest, the Gentiles.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And the Jews despised the Gentiles.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   They regarded them as dogs.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And the Gentiles had their own view of the Jews.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And what of it appeared to be an utter impossibility that they could ever come together.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   There was, as the apostle says in that very chapter,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   a middle wall of partition between them.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You see, the wall in Berlin is not the first wall that has been built in this world
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   to separate people from one another.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   The world has always had its iron curtains.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   We change the terminology, but the fact has always been there.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   The middle wall of partition.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Jews one side, Gentiles the other side.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And a bitter hatred and animosity, which we can scarcely even imagine.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And the apostle Paul, before his conversion,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   was one of the most bitter Jews the world has ever known.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   He was a Jew who reveled in it and prided himself in it,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and he despised the others.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   But this is the extraordinary thing he finds.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   That in the Christian church,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Jews and Gentiles are found together.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   The middle wall of partition, he says, has been broken down.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   He keeps on repeating that in that epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   He says, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   being predestinated according to the purpose of him
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   who worketh all things after the counsel of his will,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   in whom you also trust, we being the Jews, you also the Gentiles."
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   After that he heard the word of truth.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And then as we saw it in that second chapter, listen,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   he says, "Let me remind you.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Remember that you being in time past,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Gentiles in the flesh,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   which are called uncircumcision by that which is called
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   the circumcision in the flesh made by hens,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   that at that time you were without Christ,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   and strangers from the covenants of promise,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   But now in Christ Jesus,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   you who sometime at one time were so far off,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   have been made nigh, have been brought near."
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   How? "By the blood of Christ.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   For he is our peace who hath made both one
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   having abolished in his flesh the enmity,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   even the law of commandments contained in ordinances,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   for to make in himself of two one new man,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   so making peace."
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Now this to the apostle was the most amazing and astounding thing conceivable.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   The impossible had happened.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Jew and Gentile had been brought together
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and there was one new man in the Christian church
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   worshipping the same God and glorying in the same Savior.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Now that is one of the reasons, therefore,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   and one of the chief reasons why he gloried in the cross of Christ.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And it's that which I want to expound to you.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Let me do it like this.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   What is the cause of the divisions and the enmities
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   that characterize the life of this world?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Isn't that the big question that comes up tonight?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   My dear friends, I'm not here to talk politics to you.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I'm not here even to pay tribute to the late President Kennedy.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   That's not what I'm called upon to do.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Others do that kind of thing.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   The Christian preacher is here to deal with causes.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And thank God, in the light of this book,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   we can do so in a manner, and I say to the glory of God,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   that the statesman cannot do.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Because here is the only explanation.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   What is the cause of the divisions?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   What is the cause of the unhappiness that is in the world tonight?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Why have we had these wars?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Why are the nations preparing for a further war?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Why is there tragedy and trouble and discord?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And there's only one answer to the question.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It is the pride of the natural, unregenerate human heart.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Pride. Nothing else.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Let me show you how it works.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   The Bible is full of this teaching.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Way back at the very beginning, it gives us the story
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   of how one brother murdered another brother.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   That's the mankind in sin.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Cain murders Abel.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Why did he do it?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   He did it because of jealousy, and jealousy is the child of pride.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You see there, it is right away back at the very beginning,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   and it's gone on ever since.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   This old book is full of that kind of thing.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   There are silly people today who say,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   "Oh, you shouldn't give the Old Testament to read to a child."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Why not? Oh, the terrible things you find there.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Sins of David and things like that.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Yes, exactly. The Bible is an honest book.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   It's a realistic book. It tells you the truth.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   That is human nature as it is.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   The Bible conceals nothing.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Pride, it shows itself in all sorts of ways.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Take the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   He's got a great statement about all this.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   He was given this same insight by God to see the cause of trouble,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   so he puts it like this.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   "Let not the wise men glory in his wisdom,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   neither let the mighty men glory in his might.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Let not the rich men glory in his riches."
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And glory means boast, remember.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   "But let him that glorieth glory in this,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   that he understandeth and knoweth me,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   that I am the Lord, which exercise loving kindness,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   judgment, and righteousness in the earth.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   For in these things I delight, saith the Lord."
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   There it is again.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Then you come over to your New Testament,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   and you get exactly the same thing.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   This apostle Paul in writing to the Corinthians,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   he shows how the world in his time was divided up,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   not only Jew and Gentile,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but it was divided up into Greeks and barbarians,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   wise and unwise.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   The world has always been like this.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Here it is again in Ephesians 2,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   and then you've got an extraordinary statement of it
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   by the apostle in Philippians 3.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Listen to this little bit of autobiography
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   that the apostle Paul gives us.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   He says, "We are the circumcision,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   which worship God in the spirit
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   and rejoice in Christ Jesus,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Though," he says, "I might also have confidence in the flesh,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   if any other man thinketh that he hath
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   whereof he might trust in the flesh,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I more circumcised the eighth day
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   of the stock of Israel,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   of the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and Hebrew of the Hebrews,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   as touching the law a Pharisee,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   concerning zeal, persecuting the church,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   touching the righteousness which is in the law,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   blameless."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   There he was, proud of it all.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Now then, these are but some of the texts
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   which we have in the Scripture,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and there are many more,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   which show us that the essential cause
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   of all the strife and the unhappiness
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and the tension in the world,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and all the tragedy ultimately,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   both in individuals and in the life of nations
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   and groups within the nations,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   all these are ultimately the result of pride.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   How does it work?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Well, let me take you through the sorry catalog.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And if we don't use this night to do that,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   well then I say we've failed and failed completely.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   What do men and women pride, take pride in?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   What is it that causes this pride of theirs
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   to lead to divisions?
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Well, as we are told, they take pride in their birth.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   They take pride in their race.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   You remember the poet
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   who spoke about the lesser breeds without the law.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Pride of birth, pride of race,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   pride of nationality,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   pride of color.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Black and white, these various colors.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   You see, this is the tension in the world tonight.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   This is a part of the trouble.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   It may be, I say, the cause of the tragedy
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   that's taken place.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   But men are standing apart because of this.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Human beings, souls in the sight of God,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   but divided, color, black, white.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And remember, there are these elements on both sides.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   But you get it, as I say,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   with respect to nationality,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   with respect to race,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   with respect to the accident of birth,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and all these things,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   all those matters that the apostle enumerates there
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   in that third chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   to the Philippians,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   which I've just read to you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Now, the apostle himself,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   before he became an apostle,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   before he became a Christian,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   he delighted in these things.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   He was proud of it.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   He was proud of the fact
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   that he was an Hebrew of the Hebrews.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And he looked down upon everybody
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   who wasn't a Hebrew.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And then the particular tribe,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   the tribe of Benjamin, and so on.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   He was filled with a great pride in all this.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   What else?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Well, the next thing is, of course, power.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Pride in one's power.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   How much tension is there in the world tonight
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   between the haves and the have-nots?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Those who have want to hold on to what they've got,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   those who haven't want it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And each one is consumed with a passion,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   and inevitably you get strife and tension.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Wanting something,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   wanting to hold on to something.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Now, this is true of nations.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   This has been one of the most prolific causes of wars,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   particularly in this present century.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   But it's been a cause of wars long before that.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Greed, the desire to have, to have power,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   to be great, to be wonderful.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Wealth, power of wealth.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   It's the cause of so much industrial strife,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   employer, employed.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   The employed want a greater share of that
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   which hitherto has been the possession of the employer,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and here it is, and each one becomes rigid,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and you get tension, you get strife,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   you get division, and ultimately you get war.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   But it's all the result of pride.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Power is a wonderful thing.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Nations get drunk on power.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Individuals get drunk on power.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And once you have it, you want to hold it.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Lust for power, lust for domination.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   The whole of human history is redolent of this kind of thing.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So pride of power does this.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And then pride of intellect does exactly the same thing.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   As I've reminded you, that ancient world was divided up.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Greeks and barbarians, the wise and the unwise.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   The Greeks were a very intellectual people.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   In addition to being a great military people,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   they were a great intellectual people.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   They had produced that succession of mighty great philosophers,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   the greatest philosophers the world has ever known,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   and they were proud of it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And they looked round at all the other nations of the world
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   and they said, "What do they know?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   "What do they understand?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   "What philosophy have they got?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "Some of them are good at fighting.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "Some of them are good at business.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   "Some of them are good at navigation.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   "But they don't understand."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   So they divided up the whole world into Greeks, barbarians,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   the wise, the unwise.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And here was rivalry and tension and stress and strain.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And it's as common in the world tonight as it was then.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   These subtle divisions and distinctions
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   permeate through the whole of life.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I've come across many cases in this world
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   where this very thing has caused great agony,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   even within families.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   One member of the family, being a bit brighter than the rest,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   goes on with his education and goes to a university
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and the others don't.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I've known it lead to heartache and almost heartbreak
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   in certain families.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Intellect, the pride of the man who's got it
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and who's given an opportunity,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and the others feeling a certain amount of jealousy and of envy.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   "Who is he?" they say.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   "Because he's got a little bit of knowledge,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   "does he think he's different?" and so on.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Well, you're aware of all this.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   This is one of the many social problems
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   that are worrying the minds of the authorities
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   in this country at the present time.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Those are the three main ways in which this pride
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   that is in men because he's a sinner
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   have manifested themselves throughout the running centuries.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Now then, the next step in the argument is this.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   That there is nothing known to the world
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   that can deal with that situation.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Now, that's a very strong statement to make, isn't it?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   But I make it.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   There is nothing that the world itself knows tonight
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   that can deal with this problem.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   The state of the world at this moment
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   is an absolute proof of that in and of itself.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   The world can never make peace.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   All the world can do is to put an end,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   put a stopper to it for the time being,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   to actual war.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   The world at its best has never produced anything
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   beyond a cessation of hostilities for the time being.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   It can produce nothing but a kind of armed interval
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   in which we are not actually fighting.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   But you see, the whole fallacy behind
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   what the world is doing is this.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   It doesn't realize that merely not to fight is not peace.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Peace is positive. Peace isn't negative.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Peace means love, sympathy, understanding, a true unity.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And the world knows nothing about it
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and it cannot produce it.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Now, this is to me a most vital and important thing.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   It shows how it is that the world must inevitably fail.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   The world fools itself because it regards
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   the cessation of hostilities as positive peace.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Let me give you an illustration of what I am trying to say.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Did you notice how in the First World War
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   they used poison gas in fighting one another?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   But did you notice how in the Second World War
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   they did not use poison gas?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Some of us remember receiving instruction in 1938
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   what to do if mustard gas, etc., were used.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   But it was never used. Why not?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Is it because the world has advanced?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Is it because that man at last has got love in his heart
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   towards his fellow men?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   No. There was only one answer.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Both sides had mustard gas.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And each side knew that if it used it, the other would retaliate.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Therefore, neither side used it.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   That's not peace, my friend.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   That's not peace. That's utilitarianism.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   That's just the avoidance of doing something that's going to do you harm.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   There's no advance, there's no development.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And I think there is a great case for saying
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   that what has given us what we call peace
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   since the end of the last war in 1945
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   has not been that the nations of the world
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   are any more intelligent than they were
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   or any more loving than they were
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   or any nearer to one another than they were.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   There's only one thing that's done it,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   and that is the possession of the bombs on the two sides.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Wasn't that what solved the Cuban crisis just over a year ago?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   The two sides knew if one uses it, the other will retaliate,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and they'll both suffer so they don't use it.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   But that's not peace.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   That's fear.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   That's utilitarianism.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   That's not what we really mean by peace.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Peace, I say, is something positive.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Peace means a new attitude, a new understanding.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Peace means a love.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   But the world is incapable of producing it, even at its best.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Or take another argument.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   There are certain people in this country who say,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   "Well, better be red than dead.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Let this country go in for unilateral disarmament.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Anything's better than war," they say.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And they're prepared to do that.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   But you see, that again is no solution.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Why not? Well, for this reason.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   That if you did that, what you'd get is
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   that one section of the world would be dominated by another.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   That isn't peace.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   When a bully keeps everybody else down, there's no fighting.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But it isn't peace.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   The weakling is just dominated by the bully.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And if you go in for unilateral disarmament,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   that is the inevitable result.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You will be governed by the red.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Or if the red gives in, he'll be governed by the rest.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   That's not peace. That's domination.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   That is tyranny.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   That is the peace of a death of everything that is most glorious in human nature.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   That's serfdom.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   You don't get wars in places where there is serfdom.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   You don't even get strikes.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   But that's not peace, my friends,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   because it is entirely negative.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Not only that.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Take all the efforts that are being made in the world.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And as you look at them and as you examine them,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   you see behind them a spirit of hatred,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   a spirit of enmity, a spirit of strife.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Let's be realistic and face the facts.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   The late President Kennedy was hated and reviled
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   by many of his own fellow countrymen.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Not only those men who performed this act,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   but by many others.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Good and respectable people.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   They hated him because of his very policies.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And there is animosity and hatred on both sides.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   So when you look at the world,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   even at its best and at its highest,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   you see at once that it doesn't produce any peace.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I say this again in order to be honest and to be plain.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Some of the most bitter men I've ever met in my life have been pacifists.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I have never known such bitter hatred in the hearts of men as some pacifists I've known.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   They've been impossible to get on with, impossible to work with.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   They've been animated by a spirit of hatred against militarism.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   But that's not peace.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   While there's bitterness in your heart, you haven't got peace.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   No, no, the world can't produce peace.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   The world can never bring down the middle walls of partition.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It can produce a kind of gentlemanly appearance of peace.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   It can succeed in having a cessation of hostilities
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   only because it's wise and politic and utilitarian to do it.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   But it's always waiting for the opportunity.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And if one can only get an invention that will suddenly get in before the others,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   out it'll come.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Can you believe the words of nations?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Can you take the solemn pledges and vows?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   The history of the world gives the lie direct to any such assumption.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   No, no.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   If this century has done nothing else, it's done this.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It has proved absolutely and beyond any controversy
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   that man cannot be taught to live in a peaceable manner
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and to love his friends and his enemies by education.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Now, that was the great argument.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   I've often referred to this.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   The late Mr. H.G. Wells was the great prophet of this.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   War, he and others thought, can be banished if only you educate people.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   As they said, it's ignorant people who fight.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And the more ignorant they are, the more they fight.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's ignorance that causes people to fight.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Educate them. Show them the folly of war.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Show them the monstrosity and the evil of this.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Show them that nothing ever comes of war but harm and suffering
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   and maiming and bitterness and all the relics.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Show them that and they'll all burn their arms
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   and they'll all embrace one another and there'll never be another war.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Poor men.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   The last war convinced him, so he wrote his last book
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   with the title Mind at the End of its Tether.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   It was the end of the tether and beyond it.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   This, the most educated of all the centuries,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   has been the most bloody century.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And never has the world been so full of war and tension and strife and dispute
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   as it is this very night.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Men cannot produce peace.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Men cannot bring the opposites together.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Why?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Well, because, as I've been trying to show you,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   the trouble is in the heart of men,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   not in his mind, in his heart.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   It's his passion, it's lust, it's desire, it's pride.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Men's pride is greater than his understanding.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And so in order to please his own pride and to pamper it,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   he will do things that he knows to be wrong in his inner men.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Pride is the biggest power in the world
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   and nothing that is known to men can deal with the problem of pride.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   That is why I assert again that there is only one thing in the world this evening
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   that can give peace and unity and bring men and women together
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and give us any hope of real, true peace.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It is the cross of Christ.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's why the apostle gloried in it.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   How does he do it?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Well, it's perfectly simple.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   And you know this gospel is simple.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   And it's simple because it always gets to the root of the problem.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   And having got to the root of the problem,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   it doesn't waste its time in trying various expedients.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   It knows there's only one that can do it and it comes straight to it.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   How does it do it? Well, it does it like this.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   How does the gospel, how does the cross of Christ make peace?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Well, the first thing it does is to show us to ourselves.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Of course, we always say this, don't we?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   It isn't I who says it, it's that other man.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   If only he understood.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Our husbands and wives separate from one another.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   You listen to the story of the husband, this woman's impossible.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Listen to the woman, that man of mine, I couldn't live with him, he's an impossible man.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   It's always somebody else, isn't it?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   We are never wrong.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   We are very wonderful if only we could be understood.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   The trouble is people don't understand us.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   We are all people of peace.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   None of us wants to quarrel with anybody.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   We are not jealous, we are not envious, we are not rapacious.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   It's always somebody else, always that other person.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Do you know what this gospel does, what this cross does?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   This is what it does.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   It shows you to yourself.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And nothing else in the whole world does that but this cross.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   There is nothing that will ever humble a man or a nation but the cross of Christ.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I've shown you that everything else inevitably fails.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   But the cross tells us the simple plain truth about ourselves.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   If you look at it like this, why did the Son of God ever come into this world?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Why did he leave the courts of glory?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Why was he born as a little babe?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Why did he take unto him human nature?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Do you know there's only one answer?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   He came because man couldn't save himself.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   He said so.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   The Son of Man, he says, has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   When I look at that cross and see him dying there, what it tells me is this.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   You've got nothing.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   You've got nothing whereof to boast.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   It tells me that I am a complete failure.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And that I'm such a failure that he had to come from heaven
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and not merely teach and preach in this world but die on that cross.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Nothing else could save me.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I couldn't keep his teaching.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   How could I keep the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Who can't live up to my own code, who can't please other people?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   This idea of imitating Christ, it's the most monstrously ridiculous thing
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   that's ever been mentioned in the whole universe.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   It's impossible.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   We can't keep ordinary rules.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   We can't keep the law of England, leave alone imitate Christ in his perfection.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   He condemns us completely and absolutely.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Look at this man, the Apostle Paul.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Look at him, a soul of Tarsus.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   There he was, bursting.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Yes, circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   the Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law of Pharisee concerning zeal,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   persecuting the church, touching the righteousness which is in the law.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Blameless, perfect men, absolutely moral, absolutely religious,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   most learned men, chief of the Pharisees.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And then he met this Christ.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   One glimpse of that blessed face humbled him to the dust.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And the light that Christ by the Spirit cast upon the very law,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   which he thought he knew so well, convinced him immediately that he'd not kept it.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   He'd never--he'd missed a little word in the law.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   What was that? The word "covet"?
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   "Thou shalt not covet." He'd never seen it.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Here was the great expert on the law.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   He'd studied it all his life, was top of the examinations always,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   in every test which was given in knowledge of the law, and he'd never seen it.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   He says, "I had not known sin but by the law, for I had not known lust,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   except the law had said, 'Thou shalt not covet.'"
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   But the moment he saw that he was finished,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   "I was alive without the law once," I thought I was perfect.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I thought I was satisfactorily before God.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   But when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And the man who thought he was perfect is heard crying out,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   He's in a muddle. He's in utter confusion.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   "The good that I would, I do not; but the evil that I would, not that I do.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Now if I do that, I would not it is no more either do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   I delight in the law of God after the inward men, but I see another law in my members,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   to the law of sin which is in my members.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?"
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   That's what the cross of Christ showed him.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   It showed him that he was a complete and utter, absolute failure.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   In word, thought and deed, he has nothing to be proud of.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   He's a wretched, abominable failure.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   The cross has humbled him and crushed him to the ground.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And once you see yourself like that, you forget other people.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   But wait a minute. The cross also reveals the truth to us about others.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   It makes of Twain one new man. It deals with both of us.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   That's why it's so wonderful. I've got to be put down first.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   It's no use until I'm humbled, until I've stopped saying, "I'm all right, it's the other men.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I'm put down." But then it helps you to see the other men also.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And how does he do it? Well, what he does is this.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   The cross shows me that these other people also have souls.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   It doesn't matter what the color of their skin is.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   It doesn't matter whether they're wealthy or poor.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Whether they're very learned or very ignorant.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   It doesn't matter whether they're very powerful or very weak.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   They're souls. They're men and women, like I am.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Made originally in the image of God and standing before God in all the dignity of human nature.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   But why do they behave as they do? That's the question.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And before, I never went beyond that. I said it's because they're wrong.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   I've now seen that I'm wrong, altogether wrong, but what of them?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Ah, I'm unable to see them in a new way.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   They are but victims of the devil, even as I was.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   It isn't they as such. It is that the devil is controlling them.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   And as I see this, I begin to pity them.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   In other words, you see what the cross does is this.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   It makes us both see ourselves exactly as we are.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And the moment we see that, we see that there is no difference between us at all.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You remember we used to hear during the last war,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   of wonderful things that used to happen here in London.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   How the Duchess and the Mrs. Mop,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   were talking together in a very friendly manner in the same air raid shelter.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Quite right.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   When you are within half a centimeter of death,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   it doesn't matter very much who you are, does it?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   No, what you are by birth. You both may be dead the next moment.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   So everything was forgotten.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Well, now the cross does that. It shows us that we are all exactly the same.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   We are one in sin.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   We are one in failure.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   We are one in misery. We are one in helplessness.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   We are one in hopelessness.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   What's the point of bursting that you're a Jew,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   when you're as much a failure as the Gentiles?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   What's the point of bursting that you've got the law,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   if you can't keep the law?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   What's the point of bursting about your great brain,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   if you don't know how to live?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   What's the point of bursting about your money and your wealth,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   if you're miserable in your own heart and soul,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   and filled with jealousy and envy and mellies and spite?
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   What's the use of anything?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   What's the value of anything?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   What's the point of everything?
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   The cross humbles us, my riches gain I count,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   but loss and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   It is the cross of Christ that brings us all down to the same place.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   You see, the differences between nations and groups within the nations
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   and individuals is nothing when you look at the cross of Christ.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   We are all miserable, helpless, hopeless sinners.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   There is nothing in which we can burst,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   as the apostle puts it there in that seventh verse of 3 Philippians.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   But what things were gained to me, them I counted loss for Christ.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Yea, doubtless I count all things but loss,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   For whose sake, he says, I do count all things but dung and loss,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   that I may win Christ and be found in him,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   but the righteousness which is of God by faith.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   My friend, once you really see this message of the cross,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   you'll see yourself groveling on the dust and the floor,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   a miserable failure, a hopeless sinner.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   You can do nothing, neither can your neighbor.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   You're together in your complete helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   But thank God it doesn't leave you there.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   You both look up together into the face of the one and only Savior,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   the Savior of the world, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   He's not only the Savior of the western world,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   he's the Savior of the people of the other side of the iron curtain.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   That's why I never preach against communism or against anything else.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I'm not here to preach against, I'm here to hold a Savior for.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   He can save communists as well as he can save capitalists.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   He can save black as well as white.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   He has come to save souls.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   The Savior of the world, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the whole world.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   There is none other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Here is the only one who can encompass the whole world, the whole universe,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   and all in utter helplessness can look to him.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   And you see, this is what's so wonderful about it.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   It is he who saves.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   It isn't we, it is he who saves.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   You know, not even your believing in him saves you, it is he who saves you.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   It is he, by going to that cross and submitting himself as the Lamb of God
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   and having your sins put upon him by his Father and bearing the stroke.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   That's what saves you.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   He does it all.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   There's nothing for anybody to burst in.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   By grace are we saved through faith and that not of yourselves.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should burst.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   We're all paupers.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   And as equal paupers we are given exactly the same gift.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Nobody's got anything to burst about.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   We've done nothing, we could do nothing.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   He has done it all.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   And that's why Paul, in writing to the Romans, asks, "Where is the bursting then?
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   It is excluded."
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   "He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   "What hast thou?" says the Scripture, "that thou hast not received."
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   You see, this cross makes us one in every respect.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   We are one in sin, we are one in failure, we are one in helplessness,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   we are one in hopelessness.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   We believe in the one and only Savior together.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   We receive the same forgiveness, we are equally the children of God,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   by grace we share the same divine life, we have the same hope of glory.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And we all look on with admiration and praise and rejoicing and glory
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   into the face of the same Savior.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   That's the only way that you'll ever get peace in this world.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   That's how the middle wall of partition was broken down between the Jew and the Gentile.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   What's the point of being a Jew if you can't keep the law of which you're talking so much?
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   None at all.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   There is no difference.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Here, my dear friend, is the hope in this world tonight,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   and there is none of them.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   While men and nations stand up in their arrogance and self-confidence,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   there will be nothing but spite and malice and hatred and war and bitterness and horror.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   But the moment any man, any woman, sees the truth as it is in Jesus Christ and him crucified,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   all that is banished, it becomes dung and loss, nothing, despicable.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   My riches gain, I count but loss and poor contempt.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   What a fool, what fools we all are.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   What have you to burst in?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Who are you? How do you live?
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   You tell me you're a great intellectual.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   I ask you, how do you live?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   What if everybody knew the things you do?
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   What if everybody knew the things you think?
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   What if everybody knew the things you play with in your imagination?
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Where are you?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   You are self-satisfied.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Are you ready to come up and to be cross-examined and to be honest and admit how you live?
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   And all the jealous, envious, rapacious thoughts,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   killing Kruger with your mouth, committing murder in your mouth.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   You haven't done what that wretched fellow did in Dallas, Texas, the other night,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   but you've done it in your spirit.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   You've murdered people.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   You hate them with a bitter hatred, and that's the thing that's damnable.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   That's the thing that causes the division and the middle walls of partition.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   But it's only the cross that tells us that.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   There is nothing that will humble the pride of men or of nations,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   except to see the truth as it is revealed by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   Oh yes, once you've seen it, it will humble you to the dust.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   You'll have nothing to pride yourself in, nothing to boast of,
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   and you'll lose your jealousy and your envy.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   You're all one, but thank God.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   It'll show you the way out.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   It'll lift you up, and it'll lift the others with you.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   It'll make peace.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   It'll make of twain one new man, so making peace.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   And together you'll be able to go to God with your petitions and with your praise
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   and with your thanksgiving,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   and all the divisions will have gone,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   and you'll be one with all who believe the same message,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   rejoicing in him and enjoying this new life that he has purchased for you
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   at the cost and the price of his own precious blood.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   I wish in many ways that I could believe that the assassination of John F. Kennedy
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   is going to bring the nations of the world together.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   I know it will not. It cannot.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   It'll probably produce more strife and bitter hatred.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   But there is a death.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   There is a murder that once took place that can reconcile.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   It reconciles men to God.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   It reconciles them to one another.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   My dear friend, here's the question for you.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Stop thinking in terms of nations.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Think of yourself first.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Is that old pride there?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Is this the thing that governs you?
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   I pray that God may have shown you to yourself tonight in the light of the cross of Christ
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   that all your ugly pride is gone,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   and that you've seen your utter hopelessness and helplessness,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   and have looked up unto him who loved you so dearly
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   that he even gave his life voluntarily
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   in order that you might be rescued and saved,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   reconciled to God, reconciled to your fellow men and women.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   God forbid that I should glory in anything,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   save in the death, the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Amen.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
