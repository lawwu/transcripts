[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.760]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.920]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.540]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing the first guest
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.400]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.020]   My guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.320]   Dr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical doctor.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.880]   He's a psychiatrist and a research scientist
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.440]   In his clinical practice,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.280]   he sees patients dealing with a range
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.520]   of nervous system disorders,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.280]   including obsessive compulsive disorder, autism,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.440]   attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia, mania,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.320]   anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.680]   His laboratory develops and explores tools
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.280]   with which to understand how the nervous system works
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.920]   in the healthy situation,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.120]   as well as in disorders of the mind.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.320]   Dr. Deisseroth's laboratory has pioneered the development
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.440]   and use of what are called channelopsins,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.620]   proteins that come from algae,
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.300]   which can now be introduced to the nervous systems
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.480]   of animals and humans in order to precisely control
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.780]   the activity of neurons in the brain and body
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.520]   with the use of light.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.000]   This is a absolutely transformative technology
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060]   because whereas certain drug treatments
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.520]   can often relieve certain symptoms of disorders,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.960]   they often carry various side effects.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560]   And in some individuals, often many individuals,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.880]   these drug treatments simply do not work.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280]   The channelopsins and their related technologies
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.360]   stand to transform the way that we treat
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.160]   psychiatric illness and various disorders
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.320]   of movement and perception.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.440]   In fact, just recently, the channelopsins were applied
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.040]   in a human patient to allow an adult,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.580]   fully blind human being to see light
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.040]   for the very first time.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.160]   We also discuss Dr. Deisseroth's newly released book,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.960]   which is entitled "Projections, A Story of Human Emotions."
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.600]   This is an absolutely remarkable book
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.440]   that uses stories about his interactions with his patients
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   to teach you how the brain works
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.280]   in the healthy and diseased state,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   and also reveals the motivation for and discovery
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.240]   of these channelopsins and other technologies
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   by Carl's Laboratory that are being used now
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.520]   to treat various disorders of the nervous system,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.320]   and that in the future are certain to transform
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.500]   the fields of psychiatry, mental health,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.960]   and health in general.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.000]   I found our conversation to be an absolutely fascinating one
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.200]   about how the brain functions in the healthy state
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.900]   and why and how it breaks down in disorders of the mind.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.680]   We also discuss the current status and future
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   of psychedelic treatments for psychiatric illness,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.760]   as well as for understanding
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   how the brain works more generally.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.040]   We also discuss issues of consciousness,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   and we even delve into how somebody like Carl
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.840]   who's managing a full-time clinical practice
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.280]   and a 40-plus person laboratory
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.340]   and a family of five children and is happily married,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.720]   how he organizes his internal landscape, his own thinking,
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.560]   in order to manage that immense workload
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.360]   and to progress forward for the sake of medicine
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   and his pursuits in science.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.320]   I found this to be an incredible conversation.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.740]   I learned so much.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320]   I also learned through the course
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.600]   of reading Carl's book, "Projections,"
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.180]   that not only is he an accomplished psychiatrist
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.940]   and obviously an accomplished research scientist
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.700]   and a family man, but he's also a phenomenal writer.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.300]   "Projections" is absolutely masterfully written.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.080]   It's just beautiful, and it's accessible to anybody,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.400]   even if you don't have a science background.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.860]   So I hope that you'll enjoy my conversation
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.000]   with Carl Deisseroth as much as I did,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.400]   and thank you for tuning in.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.080]   Before we begin, I want to point out that this podcast
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   In my desire and effort to bring zero cost
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.720]   to consumer information about science
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.040]   and science-related tools to the general public,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.960]   I'd like to acknowledge the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.040]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.340]   that in my opinion are the very highest quality out there.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.600]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.160]   from Stanford, and everything about the eyeglasses
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.800]   and sunglasses was developed with performance in mind.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.660]   One of the things I really love about Roca sunglasses
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.800]   is that unlike other sunglasses,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.680]   they make it hard to see when there's a lot of cloud cover
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.960]   or when the shadows change
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.740]   or environmental conditions change.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.360]   With Roca sunglasses, they clearly understand
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.960]   the science of the visual system,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.820]   because when I put them on for the first time,
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.200]   I noticed that as I moved into shadows
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.600]   or the cloud cover changed or the day got brighter
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.500]   or dimmer, everything was still crystal clear.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.980]   And that's also because the lenses
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.520]   are tremendously high optical clarity
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.600]   and the glasses are really lightweight.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   You don't even notice that they're on.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.140]   The other thing is that the eyeglasses,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.760]   I wear readers at night, they're incredibly lightweight.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.640]   And for both the sunglasses and eyeglasses,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.400]   the aesthetic is terrific.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.600]   Unlike a lot of performance eyewear,
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.800]   which frankly can look kind of cyborg-like
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.640]   and kind of ridiculous,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.260]   the aesthetic of the glasses is such
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.180]   that you could really wear them anywhere,
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.960]   indoors or outdoors.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.640]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.760]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,

[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.760]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.160]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.880]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.480]   to help you better understand your body
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.280]   and reach your health goals.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.200]   I am a big believer in getting regular blood work done.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.240]   And now with the advent of good genetic DNA tests,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.120]   I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.620]   The simple reason for this is that many of the factors
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.880]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.000]   can only be measured and evaluated
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.520]   with a quality blood test.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.760]   And now the DNA tests further inform
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.780]   our immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.960]   One of the problems with a lot of DNA tests
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.640]   and blood tests out there, however,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.120]   is that you get the information back
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.140]   and you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.360]   With Inside Tracker, you get the numbers back
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   of different metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.160]   but it also provides simple directives
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.080]   as to how perhaps you might want to change
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.980]   your nutritional intake or your exercise regimen
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.840]   or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.480]   into alignment with where you'd like them to be.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.640]   Inside Tracker also makes this really easy.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.320]   They have a dashboard that makes organizing
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.680]   that all very simple,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.960]   and they can even have someone come to your house
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   to take the blood and DNA test.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.320]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.340]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.320]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.600]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.140]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.520]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.480]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   and I've taken it ever since,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.020]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.800]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.840]   and that I continue to take Athletic Greens
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.720]   is that it covers all my vitamin and mineral bases
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.240]   and it covers my probiotic needs.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.080]   There's now a wealth of data showing
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.000]   that probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.720]   and that a healthy gut microbiome
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   supports the gut brain axis for healthy mood.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   It also supports metabolism, immune function,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.640]   endocrine, that means hormone function,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.860]   and a host of other important biological functions.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.700]   I drink it once or twice a day.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.600]   I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.080]   or some lime juice, and it's absolutely delicious.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.640]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.740]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.400]   and if you do that, you can claim a special offer
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.680]   where they will give you a year's supply of vitamin D3.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.200]   In addition, they'll give you five free travel packs.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.760]   Vitamin D3, as we all know, is very important
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.960]   for a huge range of biological functions and health.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.760]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.000]   for your Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.380]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.720]   And now my conversation with Dr. Carl Deisseroth.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.040]   - Well, thanks for being here.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.440]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.920]   - It's been a long time coming for me
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.200]   because you may not know this,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.840]   but one of the reasons I started this podcast
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.400]   was actually so I could have this conversation.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.440]   It's but one, there are other reasons,
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.360]   but one of the goals is to be able to hold conversations
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.560]   with colleagues of mine that are doing incredible work
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.680]   in the realm of science.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.560]   And then here, we also have this really special opportunity
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.040]   because you're also a clinician, you see patients
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.640]   in and out for a long time.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.040]   So for people that might not be so familiar
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.600]   with the fields of neuroscience, et cetera,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.880]   what is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.680]   - Well, I'm married to a neurologist and I am a psychiatrist
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.280]   and we make fun of each other all the time.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.000]   So this is a lot of neuroscientists
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.920]   and a lot of brain clinicians actually think these two
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.200]   should be the same field at some point in the future.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.860]   They were in the past, they started together.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.320]   Psychiatry though, focuses on disorders
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.640]   where we can't see something that's physically wrong,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.000]   where we don't have a measurable,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.460]   where there's no blood test that makes the diagnosis.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.200]   There's no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.480]   this is depression for an individual patient.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.120]   And so psychiatry is much more mysterious
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.600]   and the only tools we have are words.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.780]   Neurologists are fantastic physicians,
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.160]   they see the stroke on brain scans,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.580]   they see the seizure and the pre-seizure activity
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.580]   with an EEG and they can measure and treat
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.540]   based on those measurables.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.900]   In psychiatry, we have a harder job, I think.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.100]   We use words, we have rating scales for symptoms,
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.900]   we can measure depression and autism with rating scales,
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.320]   but those are words still.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.160]   And ultimately that's what psychiatry is built around.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   It's an odd situation because we've got the most complex,
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.640]   beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered object
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.040]   in the universe and yet all we have are words
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.160]   to find our way in.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.360]   - So do you find that if a patient is very verbal
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.080]   or hyperverbal, that you have an easier time diagnosing them
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.640]   as opposed to somebody who's more quiet and reserved
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.920]   or I could imagine the opposite might be true as well?
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.560]   - Well, because we only have words,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.760]   you've put your finger on a key point.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.040]   If they don't speak that much in principle, it's harder.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.820]   The lack of speech can be a symptom.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.120]   We can see that in depression,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.760]   we can see that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.280]   we can see that in autism.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.180]   Sometimes by itself, that is a symptom of reduced speech.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.540]   But ultimately you do need something.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.320]   You need some words to help guide you.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.800]   And that in fact, there's challenges that I can tell you
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.480]   about where patients with depression
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.100]   who are so depressed they can't speak,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.380]   that makes it a bit of a challenge to distinguish depression
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.640]   from some of the other reasons they might not be speaking.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.920]   And this is sort of the art and the science of psychiatry.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.160]   - Do you find that there are patients that have,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.440]   well, let's call them comorbidities or conditions
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.040]   where they would land in both psychiatry and neurology,
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.080]   meaning there's damage to a particular area of the brain
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.440]   and therefore they're depressed
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.040]   and how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.140]   - Yeah, this happens all the time.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.280]   Parkinson's disease is a great example.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.500]   It can be debilitating in so many ways.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.000]   People have trouble moving, they have trouble walking,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.480]   trouble swallowing, and they can have
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.120]   truly severe depression.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.960]   And this is, you might say, oh, well,
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.400]   they've got a life-threatening illness,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.360]   but there are plenty of neurological disorders
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   where depression is not a strongly comorbid symptom,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.000]   like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, for example.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.960]   Depression is not as strongly comorbid in that disease,
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.840]   but in Parkinson's it is extremely common.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.360]   And as you know, in Parkinson's disease,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.380]   we have loss of the dopamine neurons in the midbrain.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.380]   And this is a very specific population of cells that's dying
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.200]   and probably that leads to both the movement disorder
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.020]   and the depression.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.160]   There are many examples of that
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.800]   where these two fields come together
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.220]   and you really need to work as a team.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.320]   I've had patients in my clinic
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.080]   that I treat the depression
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.580]   associated with their Parkinson's
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.560]   and a neurologist treats the movement
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.740]   associated with the Parkinson's and we work together.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.200]   - Do you think we will ever have a blood test
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.700]   for depression or schizophrenia or autism?
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.960]   And would that be a good or a bad thing?
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.040]   - I think ultimately there will be quantitative tests.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.880]   Already efforts are being made
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.760]   to look at certain rhythms in the brain using external EEGs
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.880]   to look at brainwaves effectively,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.420]   look at the ratios of certain frequencies
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.060]   to other frequencies.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.460]   And there's some progress being made on that front.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.260]   It's not as good as it could be.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.120]   It doesn't really give you the confidence
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.200]   for the individual patient that you would like.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.400]   But ultimately what's going on in the brain
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.720]   in psychiatric disease is physical
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.660]   and it's due to the circuits and the connections
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.440]   and the projections in the brain that are not working
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.920]   as they would in a typical situation.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.280]   And I do think we'll have those measurables at some point.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.480]   Now, is that good or bad?
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.960]   I think that will be good.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.340]   One of the challenges we have with psychiatry
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.940]   is it is an art as well as a science
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.460]   to elicit these symptoms in a precise way.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.340]   It does take some time and it would be great
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.860]   if we could just do a quick measurement.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.220]   Could it be abused or misused?
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.380]   Certainly, but that's, I think, true for all of medicine.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.320]   - I want to know, and I'm sure there are several,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.660]   but what do you see as the biggest challenge
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.420]   facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness today?
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.300]   - I think we have, we're making progress
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.940]   on what the biggest challenge is,
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.260]   which I think there's still such a strong stigma
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.260]   for psychiatric disease that patients often don't come to us
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.660]   and they feel that they should be able
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.500]   to handle this on their own.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.700]   And that can slow treatment.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.660]   It can lead to worsening symptoms.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.380]   We know, for example, patients who have
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.400]   untreated anxiety issues, if you go for a year or more
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.640]   with a serious untreated anxiety issue,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.380]   that can convert to depression.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.740]   You can add another problem on top of the anxiety.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.700]   And so it would be, why do people not come for treatment?
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.180]   They feel like this is something they should be able
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.260]   to master on their own, which can be true,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.180]   but usually some help is a good thing.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.660]   - That raises a question related to something
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.360]   I heard you say many years ago at a lecture,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.320]   which was that, this was a scientific lecture,
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.780]   and you said, you know, we don't know how other people feel.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.940]   Most of the time, we don't even really know how we feel.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.680]   Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   and the dearth of ways that we have to talk about feelings.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.060]   I mean, there's so many words, I don't know how many,
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.800]   but I'm guessing there are more than a dozen words
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.980]   to describe the state that I call sadness.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.300]   But as far as I understand,
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.700]   we don't have any way of comparing that
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.160]   in a real objective sense.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.760]   So how, as a psychiatrist,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.940]   when your job is to use words to diagnose,
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.820]   words of the patient to diagnose,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.620]   do you maneuver around that?
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.060]   And what is this landscape that we call feelings or emotions?
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.820]   - This is really interesting.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.260]   People, here we have, there's a tension
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.220]   between the words that we've built up in the clinic
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.980]   that mean something to the physicians.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.140]   And then there's the colloquial use of words
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.240]   that may not be the same.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.560]   And so that's the first level we have to sort out.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.620]   When someone says, you know, I'm depressed,
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.260]   what exactly do they mean by that?
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.460]   That may be different from what we're talking about
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.460]   in terms of depression.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.860]   So part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.340]   and to get into how they're actually feeling,
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.580]   get rid of the jargon and get to real world examples
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.700]   of how they're feeling.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.700]   So, you know, how much do you look forward into the future?
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.960]   How much hope do you have?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.020]   How much planning are you doing for the future?
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.220]   So these, here now you're getting into actual things
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.420]   you can talk about that are unambiguous.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.140]   Someone says, yeah, I can't even think about tomorrow.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.860]   I'm not, I don't see how I'm gonna get to tomorrow.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.900]   That's a nice, precise thing that, you know,
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.460]   it's sad, it's tragic, but it's also,
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.200]   that means something and we know what that means.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.020]   That's the hopelessness symptom of depression.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.860]   And that is what I try to do
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.080]   when I do a psychiatric interview.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.780]   I try to get past the jargon
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.980]   and get to what's actually happening in a patient's life
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.380]   and in their mind.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.500]   But as you say, ultimately, you know,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.780]   and this shows up across,
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.940]   I address this issue every day in my life,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.940]   whether it's in the lab where we're looking at animals,
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.660]   whether fish or mice or rats and studying their behavior
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.200]   or when I'm in a conversation with just a friend
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.780]   or a colleague or when I'm talking to a patient,
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.580]   I never really know what's going on inside the mind
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580]   of the other person.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:24.860]   I get some feedback, I get words, I get behaviors,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.220]   I get actions, but I never really know.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.460]   And as you said at the very beginning of the question,
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.480]   you know, often we don't even have the words
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.260]   and the insight to even understand
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.940]   what's going on in our own mind.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.880]   I think a lot of psychiatrists are pretty introspective.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.060]   That's part of the reason they end up in that specialty.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.160]   And so maybe we spend a little more time
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.300]   than the average person thinking
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.620]   about what's going on within,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.440]   but it doesn't mean we have answers.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.600]   - So in this area of trying to figure out
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.940]   what's going on under the hood through words,
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.880]   it sounds like certain words would relate
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.020]   to this idea of anticipation and hope.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.140]   Is it fair to say that that somehow relates
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.900]   to the dopamine system in the sense
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.440]   that dopamine is involved in motivated behaviors?
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.140]   I mean, is that an, if I say, for instance,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.920]   and I won't ask you to run a session with me here for free.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.840]   - We'll do that off camera.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.680]   - Okay, right.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.280]   If I were to say, you know,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.920]   I just can't imagine the tomorrow.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.880]   I just can't do it.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.100]   So that's not action-based.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.680]   That's purely based on my internal narrative.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.240]   But I could imagine things like, you know,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.700]   I have a terrible time sleeping.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.160]   I'm not hungry. I'm not eating.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.980]   So statements about physical actions, I'm guessing,
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.380]   also have validity.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.220]   - Absolutely.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.240]   - And there are now ways to measure
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.780]   the accuracy of those statements.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.700]   Like for instance, if I gave you permission,
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.840]   you could know if I slept last night
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.060]   or whether or not I was just saying
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.320]   I had a poor night's sleep.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.440]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.720]   - So in moving forward through 2021
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.680]   and into the next 10 and 100 years of psychiatry,
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.800]   do you think that the body reporting
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.400]   some of the actions of a human
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.560]   are going to become useful and mesh with the words
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.980]   in a way that's going to make your job easier?
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.920]   - I do think that's true.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.680]   And these, the two things you've mentioned,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.560]   eating and sleeping,
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.320]   those are additional criteria
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.860]   that we use to diagnose depression.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.640]   These are the vegetative signs, we call them,
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.560]   of depression, poor sleep, and poor eating.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.420]   And if you have a baseline for somebody,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.020]   that's the real challenge though.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.700]   What's different in that person?
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.720]   Some people with depressed, they sleep more.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.520]   Some people who are depressed, they sleep less.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.620]   Some people who are depressed,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.640]   they're more physically agitated
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.920]   and they move around more.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.020]   Some people who are depressed,
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.340]   they move less even while they're awake.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.100]   And so you need, here's the challenge
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.180]   is you can't just look at how they are now.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.280]   You have to get a baseline and then see how it's changed.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.200]   And that can be a challenge that raises ethical issues.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.700]   How do you collect that baseline information
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.720]   from someone healthy?
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.560]   I don't think that's something we have solved.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.860]   Of course, with phones and accelerometers and phones,
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.780]   you could in principle collect a lot of baseline information
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.100]   from people, but that would have to be treated
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.540]   very carefully for privacy reasons.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.220]   - And in terms of measuring one's own behavior,
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.880]   I've heard of work that's going on.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.420]   Sam Golden up at the University of Washington
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.080]   who works on aggression and animal models
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.600]   was telling me that there's some efforts that he's making
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.560]   and perhaps you're involved in this work as well.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.560]   I don't know of devices that would allow people to detect,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.500]   for instance, when they're veering
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.740]   towards a depressive episode for themselves,
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.900]   that they may choose or not choose to report that
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.820]   to their clinician.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.180]   Maybe they don't even have a clinician.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.380]   Maybe this person that you referred to at the beginning,
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.800]   this person who doesn't feel comfortable
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.900]   coming to talk to you,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.460]   maybe something is measuring changes
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.060]   in the inflection of their voice
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.540]   or the speed at which they get up from a chair.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.940]   Do you think that those kinds of metrics
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.180]   will eventually inform somebody,
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.980]   "Hey, you're in trouble."
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.060]   This is getting to this question of,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.820]   back to the statement that I heard you make
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.360]   and it rung in my mind now, I think for more than a decade,
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.940]   which is oftentimes we don't even know how we feel.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.500]   - Yeah, that I do like because that gives the patient,
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.040]   the agency to detect what's going on.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.140]   And even separate from modern technology,
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.380]   this has been part of the art of psychiatry
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.660]   is to help patients realize that sometimes other people
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.380]   observing them can give them the earliest warning signs
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.220]   of depression.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.900]   We see this very often in family.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.480]   They'll notice when the patient is changing
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.060]   before the patient does.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.860]   And then there are things the patient may notice,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.500]   but not correctly ascribe to the onset of depression.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.460]   And a classic example of that is what we call
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.220]   early morning awakening.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.460]   And this is something that can happen very early
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.260]   as people start to slide into depression.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.780]   They start to wake up earlier and earlier,
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.860]   just inexplicably they're awake at.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.140]   - So this is like 2 a.m., 3 a.m. type waking?
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.260]   - It could start, yeah, it could start at 5 a.m.,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.460]   could go to four.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.980]   - And unable to fall back asleep.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.860]   - Unable to fall back asleep, exactly.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.400]   So that's, and that, they may not know what to do with that.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.140]   It could just be, from their perspective,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.860]   it's just something that's happening.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.580]   But if you put enough of that information together,
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.780]   that could be a useful warning sign for the patient
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.020]   and it could help them seek treatment.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.900]   And I think that is something that could be really valuable.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   - Interesting.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.820]   So in this framework of, you know,
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.300]   needing words to self-report or machines to detect
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.220]   how we feel or, and maybe inform a psychiatrist
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.860]   how a patient feels,
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.140]   want to touch on some of the technologies
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.080]   that you've been involved in building.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.980]   But as a way to march into that,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:52.180]   are there any very good treatments for psychiatric disease?
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.660]   Meaning, are there currently any pills, potions,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.080]   forms of communication that reliably work every time
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.520]   or work in most patients?
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.740]   And could you give a couple examples
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.380]   of great successes of psychiatry if they exist?
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.220]   - Yes.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.020]   Yeah, we are fortunate, and this coming back to my,
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.820]   you know, the joking between my wife and myself
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.300]   in terms of neurology and psychiatry.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.740]   We actually, in psychiatry,
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.660]   despite the depths of our, the mystery we struggle with,
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.020]   many of our treatments are actually, you know,
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.140]   we may be doing better than some other specialties
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.020]   in terms of actually causing, you know,
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.980]   the therapeutic benefit for patients.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.020]   We do help patients, you know,
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.060]   the patients who suffer from, by the way,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.660]   both medications and talk therapy
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.380]   have been shown to be extremely effective in many cases.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.620]   For example, people with panic disorder,
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.180]   cognitive behavioral therapy, just working with words,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.260]   helping people identify the early signs
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.560]   of when they're starting to move toward a panic attack.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.060]   What are the cognitions that are happening?
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.160]   You can train people to derail that,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.480]   and you can very potently treat panic disorder that way.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.400]   - How long does something like that take on average?
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.380]   - For a motivated, insightful patient,
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.940]   you can have a very cookbook-y series of sessions,
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.740]   you know, six to 12 sessions,
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.020]   or even less for someone who's very insightful and motivated,
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.520]   and it can have a very powerful effect that quickly.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.500]   And that's just with words.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.540]   There are many psychiatric medications
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.400]   that are very effective for the conditions
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.500]   that they're treating, anti-psychotic medications.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.920]   They have side effects, but boy, do they work.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.800]   They really can clear up,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.120]   particularly the positive symptoms of schizophrenia,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.720]   for example, the auditory hallucinations, the paranoia.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.140]   People's lives can be turned around by these.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.780]   - We should clarify positive symptoms.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.780]   You mean not positive in the qualitative sense.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.400]   You mean positive meaning that the appearance
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.600]   of something abnormal.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.760]   - Exactly, yeah, and thank you for that clarification.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.420]   When we say positive symptoms,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.060]   we do mean the addition of something
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.100]   that wasn't there before,
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.000]   like a hallucination or a paranoia,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.720]   and that stands in contrast to the negative symptoms
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.400]   where something is taken away,
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.600]   and these are patients who are withdrawn.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.200]   They have what we call thought blocking.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.420]   They can't even progress forward in a sequence of thoughts.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.040]   Both of those can be part of schizophrenia.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.480]   The hallucinations and the paranoia
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.900]   are more effectively treated right now,
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.180]   but they are effectively treated.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.380]   And then, you know, this is a frustrating
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.920]   and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.260]   There are treatments like electroconvulsive therapy,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.220]   which is where, you know,
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.120]   it's extremely effective for depression.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.460]   We have patients who nothing else works for them,
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.360]   where they can't tolerate medications,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.760]   and you can administer under a very safe,
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.560]   controlled condition where the patient's body is not moving.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.960]   They're put into a very safe situation
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.580]   where the body doesn't move or seize.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.780]   It's just an internal process that's triggered in the brain.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.820]   This is an extraordinarily effective treatment
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.880]   for treatment-resistant depression.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.640]   At the same time, I find it as heartening
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.240]   as it is to see patients respond to this
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.980]   who have severe depression.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.180]   I'm also frustrated by it.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.680]   Why can't we do something more precise than this
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.600]   for these very severe cases?
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.960]   And people have sought for decades to understand
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.120]   how is it that a seizure is leading to the relief
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.420]   of depression, and we don't know the answer yet.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.540]   We would love to do that.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.420]   People are working hard on that,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.060]   but that is a treatment that does work too.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.660]   In all of these cases, though, in psychiatry,
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.860]   the frustrating thing is that we don't have
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.780]   the level of understanding that a cardiologist has
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.900]   in thinking about the heart.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.180]   You know, the heart is, we now know, it's a pump.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.940]   It's pumping blood, and so you can look at everything
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.380]   about how it's working or not working
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.460]   in terms of that frame.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.120]   It's clearly a pump.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.700]   We don't really have that level of what is the circuit
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.080]   really there for in psychiatry?
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.900]   And that's what is missing.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.500]   That's what we need to find so we can design
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.140]   truly effective and specific treatments.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.940]   - So what are the pieces that are going to be required
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.940]   to cure autism, cure Parkinson's, cure schizophrenia?
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:16.240]   I would imagine there are several elements and bins here,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.820]   understanding that the natural biology,
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.420]   understanding what the activity patterns are,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.260]   how to modify those.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.220]   Maybe you could just tell us what you think.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.060]   What is the bento box of the perfect cure?
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.860]   - Yeah, I think the first thing we need is understanding.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.140]   We need, almost every psychiatric treatment has been
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.900]   serendipitously identified, just noting by chance
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.760]   that something that was done for some person
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.140]   also had a side effect.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.980]   - Like lithium or something.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.760]   - Like lithium is a good example.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.280]   - Is it true that it was the urine of guinea pigs
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.700]   given lithium that was given to manic patients
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.840]   that made them not manic?
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.700]   Is that true?
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.420]   - I don't have firsthand knowledge of that,
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.240]   but I would defer that.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.460]   But it's true for essentially every treatment.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.660]   You know, the antidepressants originally, you know,
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.380]   arose as anti-tuberculosis drugs, for example.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.220]   - I did not know that.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.700]   - Yeah, and so this is a classic example for,
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.760]   and this is across all of psychiatry.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.340]   And of course, there's the seizures as well.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.380]   That was noticed that patients who had epilepsy,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.260]   they had a seizure and also had depression
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.380]   that they became much, at least for a while,
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.580]   they were improved after the seizure.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.420]   - That's amazing.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.220]   I don't want to take you off course of the question that,
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.200]   answering the question I asked,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.280]   but I've heard before that if autistic children get a fever,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.840]   that their symptoms improve.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.160]   Is that true?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.820]   - I've done a fair bit of work with autism.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.200]   In my clinical practice, I work with adult autism,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.420]   and I have heard statements like that
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.600]   and descriptions like that from patients
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.740]   and their families.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.240]   That is very hard to study quantitatively
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.400]   because often with the children,
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.800]   you have this not as quantitative as you'd like
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.720]   a collection of symptom information from home.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.260]   But I have heard that enough
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.140]   that I think there may well be something to that.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.940]   And what is, anytime you have a fever, what's going on?
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.620]   Well, we know all the cells in the brain,
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.540]   and I know this as an electrophysiologist,
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.580]   if you just change the temperature by a few degrees,
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.540]   everything changes about how neurons work.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.460]   And that's even just a single neuron.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.360]   It's even more likely to be complex and different
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.080]   with a circuit of neurons that are all affecting each other.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.740]   Just elevate the temperature a little bit,
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.640]   everything's different.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.400]   And so it's plausible for sure that things like that
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.760]   could happen and do happen.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   And yet, when you think about autism, to take your example,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.760]   yes, we see changes,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.480]   but what is the element in the brain
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.600]   that's analogous to the pumping heart?
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.640]   When we think about the symptoms of depression,
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.940]   that's maybe, we think about motivation and dopamine neurons.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.220]   When we think about autism, it's a little more challenging.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:03.220]   There's a deficit in social interaction
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.940]   and in communication.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.260]   And so where is that?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.840]   Where is that situated?
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   What is the key principle governing the social interaction?
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.740]   This is where we need the basic science
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.340]   to bring us a step forward.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.800]   So we can say, okay, this is the process that's going on.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.140]   This is what's needed for the incredibly complex task
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.960]   of social interaction,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.520]   where you've got incredibly rich data streams of sound
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.100]   and meaning, eye contact, body movement.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.200]   And that's just for one person.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.080]   What if there's a group of people?
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.520]   This is overwhelming for people with autism.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.900]   What's the unifying theme there?
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.440]   It's a lot of information.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   And that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.840]   the amount of information coming in
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.900]   through a social interaction, particularly with words
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.840]   and language.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.000]   And so then that turns our attention as neuroscientists.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.080]   We think, okay, let's think about the parts of the brain
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   that are involved in dealing with merging complex data
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.320]   streams that are very high in bit rate
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.820]   that need to be fused together into a unitary concept.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.160]   And that starts to guide us and maybe we can,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.780]   and we know other animals are social in their own way
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.040]   and we can study those animals.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.120]   And so that's how I think about it.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.360]   There's hope for the future,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.640]   thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might,
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.140]   and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.360]   to make this typical behavior happen.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.080]   And that will help us understand how it becomes atypical.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.480]   - So that seems like the first, to me,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.960]   the first bin of this, what I call the bento box,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.980]   for lack of a better analogy,
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.660]   that we need to know the circuits.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.960]   We need to know the cells in the various brain regions
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.320]   and portions of the body
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   and how they connect to one another
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.980]   and what the patterns of activity are under a normal,
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.800]   quote unquote, healthy interaction.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:04.060]   If we understand that, then it seems that the next step,
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.260]   which of course could be carried out in parallel, right?
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.100]   That work can be done alongside work
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.440]   where various elements within those circuits
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.080]   are tweaked just right.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.160]   Like the tuning of a piano in the subtle way,
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.280]   or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.620]   if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak,
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.120]   you've been very involved in trying to generate those tools.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.620]   So tell us about channelopsins,
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:34.400]   why you created them and where they're at now
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.520]   in the laboratory and perhaps also in the clinic.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.920]   - Well, this is a, first of all,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.960]   I give nature the credit for creating channelopsins.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.120]   These are beautiful little proteins that are made by algae,
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.280]   single-celled green algae.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.140]   And it's a great story in basic science
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.480]   that our understanding of animal behavior,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.680]   sensation, cognition, and action in our brains
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   all the way back to a botanist in the 1850s and 1860s
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.520]   in Russia is where the story begins.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.320]   So this was a botanist named Andrei Fominzin
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.860]   who worked at St. Petersburg.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.860]   And he had noticed in the river near his laboratory
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.660]   that there were algae that he could look at
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.120]   in a dish, in a saucer.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.520]   He could put them there.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.320]   And when he had light shining from the side,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   the green tinge in the saucer of water would move
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.760]   to a particular distance from the light
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.380]   that he was shining from the side,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.720]   which was an amazing thing.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.840]   If he made the light brighter,
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.060]   the green tinge would back off a little bit
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.560]   to a more optimal location.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.400]   So just the right light level.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.980]   So this was plant behavior.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.640]   It was light-driven plant behavior.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.160]   And he delved into this a little bit.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.680]   He identified that with microscopy,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.020]   he could see that there were little single-celled algae
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.340]   with flagella that were swimming to the right light level.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.880]   So behaving plants, and this has been the secret
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   that's helped us unlock so many principles
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.800]   of animal behavior.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   So it turns out these algae achieve this amazing result
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:25.400]   with a single gene that encodes a single protein.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.760]   What's a protein?
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.280]   It's just a little biomolecule that does a job in a cell.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.240]   And these are proteins that sit in the surface of cells
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.240]   in their surface membrane.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.440]   And when a photon, a light particle hits them,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.200]   they open a little pore, a little hole in the membrane,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.480]   and charged particles, ions like sodium,
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.320]   rush across the pore.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.640]   Now, why do they do that?
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   They do that to guide their flagella.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.380]   That signal coming in, those ions coming in
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.640]   through the pore in response to light,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.780]   guide their flagellar motor that guides them
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.760]   to a particular spot in the saucer, okay?
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.800]   Now that's plant behavior, but it turns out, as you know,
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.860]   this movement of ions across the membrane,
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.180]   this happens to also be neural code in our brains
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.080]   for on or off.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.400]   Sodium ions rushing into cells turns them on,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.880]   makes them fire away, fire action potentials
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.460]   communicate to the next cell down the chain.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.980]   And this is an amazing opportunity
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.280]   because we can borrow these proteins.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.800]   In fact, we can take the gene
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.320]   that directs the creation of the protein
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.540]   and we can use genetic tricks, modern genetic tricks,
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:42.240]   to put that gene into neurons in the brains of mammals,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.540]   and then use light to turn those cells,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.240]   the specific cells that we've put this gene into,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.200]   turn them on.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.960]   There are other opsins, we call them,
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.260]   that you can use to turn cells off.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.880]   It's all fast, real time.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.640]   You can play in patterns of activity in real time
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.960]   into cells or kinds of cells, just as a conductor,
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.720]   elicits the music from the orchestra,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.680]   and the strings, and the woodwinds.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.760]   And you can see what matters.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.240]   What matters for sensation, what matters for cognition,
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.200]   what matters for action, and we call this optogenetics.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.520]   - Beautiful, and I must say it was quite an honor
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.000]   and a privilege to watch optogenetics move
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.780]   from idea to discovery to the laboratory.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.140]   I think we were postdocs at the same time,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.460]   which is living proof that people move at different rates.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.820]   [laughing]
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.340]   That's a joke at my expense, by the way.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.260]   But it's- - We end up in the same spot.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.740]   [laughing]
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.180]   - Physically, if not professionally,
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.420]   but nonetheless, it's been a marvelous story thus far.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.720]   And I'd like to, maybe you could give us,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.220]   I'd like to just touch on a couple examples
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.820]   of where the technology resides in laboratories now.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.220]   So maybe the range of animals that it's being used in
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:03.380]   and some of the phenomenon that channelrhodopsins
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.160]   and their related genes and proteins
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.800]   are starting to elicit what you've seen.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.420]   And then I'd like to talk about their applicability
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.860]   to the clinic, which is, I think,
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.000]   the bigger mission, if you will.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.500]   - Yeah, so this is, you know, this whole thing,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.780]   you know, it's been about now going on 17 years
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.420]   that we've been putting channelrhodopsins into neurons.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.660]   It started just like Andrzej Famincin's work in a dish
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.720]   by 2000, that was in 2004.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.180]   In 2007, we were putting these into behaving mice
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.960]   and we were able to, with a switch,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.660]   cause them to move one direction or another.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.900]   By 2009-
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.340]   - So basically, you're controlling the mouse's behavior.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.620]   - Yeah, exactly, in real time.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.260]   So we could make a mouse that was just sitting there
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.620]   doing nothing to then turn left very consistently,
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.940]   in fact, go around in a circle,
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.060]   and as soon as we turn off the light, it would stop.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.740]   That was an eye-opening moment.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.980]   It took really a few years to make optogenetics work.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.100]   There was a lot of putting all the,
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.620]   there were a lot of problems that had to be solved.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.140]   These channelrhodopsins actually don't move many ions.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.060]   They have a small current, small conductance, as we say.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.100]   And so we had to figure out ways to pack a lot of them
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.420]   into cells without damaging cells
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.140]   and still make them targetable.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.100]   So we don't want them to just be in all the cells,
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.500]   cause then it becomes just like an electrode.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.220]   You're just stimulating all the cells that are nearby.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.620]   We had to keep that specificity,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.500]   make them targetable to just one kind of cell or another
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.420]   while still packing in large numbers of them
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.820]   into those cells.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.460]   And we had to get in the light in safe and specific ways.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.380]   And so it took probably about four or five years
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.580]   to really create optogenetics between 2004 and 2009.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.780]   By the end of that time, though,
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.900]   we had all the basic light delivery,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.500]   gene delivery principles worked out,
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.500]   and people started to apply the technology to fish,
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.620]   to rats, to mice, to non-human primates like monkeys.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:14.260]   And just a couple months ago,
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.020]   my colleague, Botond Roska in Switzerland,
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.860]   succeeded in putting channelrhodopsins
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.660]   into the eyes of human beings
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.820]   and making a blind person see.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.780]   And so that's pretty cool.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.660]   This was a patient with retinal degeneration,
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.920]   and he provided a channelrhodopsin
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.860]   into the eye of this patient
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   and was able to confer some light sensitivity
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.780]   onto this patient that wasn't there before.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.620]   - An amazing paper and discovery.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.100]   I realize it was one patient,
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.060]   but it's such an important milestone.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.840]   - Well, as you say, it's a very important milestone,
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.660]   and the history of that is very deep.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.260]   Almost 10 years earlier,
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.460]   Botond, Roska, and I had published a paper in Science
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.460]   in human retina, but explanted, taken from cadavers
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.940]   from someone who had died, living retina,
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.940]   taken out, opsins put into this retinal tissue,
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.600]   and showing that it worked, recording from the cells,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.160]   showing that in these human neurons, retinal neurons,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.620]   that you could get light responses.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.740]   But then, from that moment,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.060]   almost 10 years of how clinical development goes,
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.580]   and this is a gene therapy,
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:25.220]   so you've got all the regulations and concerns and all that.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.780]   It took almost 10 years to get to this point now
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.860]   where a living human being has a new functionality
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.800]   that wasn't there before.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.780]   Now, that's incredibly inspiring,
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.300]   and it's a beautiful thing.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.900]   I would say, though, that the broader significance
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.140]   of optogenetics is really still understanding,
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.660]   because once you understand how the circuitry works
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.460]   and which cells actually matter,
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.680]   then any kind of treatment becomes more grounded
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.180]   and logical and specific and principled.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.360]   And whether it's a medication or a talk therapy
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.780]   or brain stimulation treatment
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.480]   with electrical or magnetic means,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.560]   if you actually know what matters,
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.760]   that is incredibly powerful.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   And I think, no, not intended to disparage
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.280]   the beautiful retinal work and conferring vision
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.440]   on someone who couldn't see, of course, that's wonderful.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.540]   But, and that's direct, what you might call
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.140]   direct optogenetics in patients.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.420]   Indirect is everything that comes from understanding.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.340]   Okay, we know these cells matter now for this symptom.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.040]   Well, how can we target those cells
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.580]   and help them work better in patients by any means?
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.640]   And I think that's the broader significance
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.220]   of optogenetics clinically.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.720]   - You and I know Boton well,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   and you and Boton share this incredible big vision
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:50.340]   that I think only a clinician can really understand,
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.580]   being in close contact with and the suffering of patients
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.640]   as a ultimate motivator of developing technologies,
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.340]   which makes me have to ask,
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.880]   did you decide to become a scientist
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.300]   to find cures for mental disease?
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.660]   - No, I didn't.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.480]   It's a really important question to actually look back
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.480]   and see the steps that brought you to a particular place.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.620]   And that was not what brought me initially to science.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.360]   And it's okay to, I think, to embrace the twists and turns
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   that life brings to you.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.060]   But I was always interested in the brain.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.600]   And so that was something that for me started
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.420]   from a very early age.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.860]   I was, you know, we talked about being introspective.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.800]   I noticed very early on,
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.440]   I had a deep love of poetry and stories,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.540]   and I was a voracious reader.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.540]   And I was amazed by how words could make me feel
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:57.020]   in particular ways, even separate from their, you know,
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.320]   of course, dictionary meanings, the rhythm,
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.180]   and how they work together, even separate from meaning.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.540]   And I was stunned by poets that could use words
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.380]   in new ways that were even divorced
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.400]   from their meaning at all,
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.420]   and yet could still trigger specific emotions.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.780]   And I was, this was always fascinating to me.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.780]   So, you know, I wanted to understand that.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.140]   And so I was interested,
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.260]   and I became interested in the brain.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.720]   And I thought, well, I'm gonna have to study the human brain
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.180]   because only human beings can describe
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.200]   what's going on inside enough.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.480]   So in college, I began to steer myself toward medicine
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.920]   and with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.900]   And so I came here to medical school
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.880]   and did an MD/PhD program,
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.080]   planning neurosurgery all the way through.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.780]   The first rotation I did at the end of medical school,
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.500]   as you know, you do rotations,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.060]   you go through different specialties,
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.060]   and some of these are required rotations
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.900]   that everybody has to do.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.820]   Some are elective, where you can pick what you wanna do.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.180]   I elected to do neurosurgery first,
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.780]   even before regular surgery,
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.980]   I was not sure I wanted to do it, and I loved it.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.380]   I had a fantastic time.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.580]   There was an amazing patient who had a thalamic damage,
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.020]   and there was a neglect syndrome
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.600]   where the patient was not able to be aware of something
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.820]   that was right in front of him.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.980]   - Even though their vision was perfectly fine.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.860]   - Even though their vision was perfectly fine, exactly.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.460]   And so I was, and I loved the operating room.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:36.260]   I loved the rhythm of suturing and the precision of it.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.000]   And I loved being able to help patients immediately.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.220]   But then a required rotation was in psychiatry,
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.400]   which I was not looking forward to at all.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.520]   And that completely reset my whole life,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.920]   that experience in psychiatry.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.000]   And it was at that moment that I saw this is,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.840]   first of all, the greatest need, the depth of suffering
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.640]   and the depth of the mystery together.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.160]   And also it was, I almost feel a little guilty about this.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.840]   It's so interesting too.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.820]   Yes, yes, yes, we can help.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:14.800]   Yes, there's need.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.280]   But as a scientist, this is amazing
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.120]   that someone's reality can be different from my own.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.360]   With everything physically, as far as we can tell,
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.020]   the same with the measures we have,
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.440]   and yet we've got a different reality.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.080]   That is an amazing thing.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.240]   And if we couldn't understand that and help these people,
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.320]   that would be just more than anybody could ask for it.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.460]   And so that's how I ended up taking this path,
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.280]   just a required rotation in psychiatry.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.920]   - It all started with poetry.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.320]   - And it started with poetry.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   - Yeah, out of respect for poetry,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.880]   are there any favorites that you spend time with
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.500]   on a regular basis?
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.500]   - I mean, the ones who got me down this path early on,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.520]   I remember in childhood in high school,
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.400]   Borges had an immense influence on me.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.080]   I studied Spanish all the way through and reading his work.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.560]   He was a great writer.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.560]   He wrote both in English and in Spanish,
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.680]   and being able to appreciate his poetry both in English
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.120]   and in Spanish was a pretty amazing thing.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.640]   Not many poets can do that.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.480]   - You're bilingual.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.560]   - I'm not, I wouldn't say now.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.300]   I became, at one point I was effectively fluent in Spanish,
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.520]   and I'm pretty good with medical Spanish still,
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.940]   because we use Spanish all the time in the clinic here.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.460]   I wouldn't claim full fluency,
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.240]   but it's something I definitely use all the time.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.900]   And it's been very helpful in the clinic.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.000]   - Yeah, Borges is wonderful.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.820]   As the son of an Argentine, I grew up hearing about it,
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.560]   and I learned that Borges' favorite city was Geneva.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.360]   So I spent time in Geneva only for that reason.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.460]   It also turns out to be an interesting city.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.720]   So you developed methods to control neurons
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.740]   with these algae proteins using light.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.680]   In 2015, there was this,
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.340]   what I thought was a very nice article
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.200]   published in "The New Yorker" describing your work
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.920]   and the current state of your work
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.600]   in the laboratory in the clinic,
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.440]   and an interaction with a patient.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.320]   So this is, as I recall, a woman who was severely depressed.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.360]   And you reported in that article
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.480]   some of the discussion with this patient,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.800]   and then in real time,
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.240]   increased the activation of the so-called vagus nerve,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.360]   this 10th cranial nerve that extends out of the skull
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.280]   and innervates many of the viscera and body.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.840]   What is the potential for channelrhodopsins,
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.300]   or related types of algae engineering,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.160]   to be used to manipulate the vagus?
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.360]   Because I believe in that instance,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.960]   it wasn't channelopsin stimulation,
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.720]   it was electrical stimulation, right?
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.240]   Or to manipulate, for instance,
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.840]   a very small localized region of the brain.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.400]   Let me frame it a little bit differently
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.360]   in light of what we were talking about
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.560]   a couple of minutes ago.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.000]   My understanding is that if somebody has severe depression
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.320]   and they take any number of the available
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.640]   pharmaceutical agents that are out there,
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.040]   SSRI, serotoninergic agents,
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.000]   increased dopamine, increased whatever,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.360]   that sometimes they experience relief,
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.200]   but there are often serious side effects.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.920]   Sometimes they don't experience relief,
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.080]   but as I understand it,
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.640]   channelopsins and their related technology, in principle,
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   would allow you to turn on or off
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.560]   the specific regions of the brain
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.380]   that lead to the depressive symptoms,
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.480]   or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.780]   or a positive anticipation circuit.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.400]   Where are we at now in terms of bringing this technology
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.960]   to the nervous system?
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.920]   And let's start with the body and then move into the skull.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.440]   - Yeah, so starting with the body is a good example
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.680]   because it highlights the opportunity
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.700]   and how far we have to go.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.720]   So let's take this example of vagus nerve stimulation.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.080]   So the vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   It comes from the brain, it goes down,
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.400]   it innervates the heart, innervates the gut.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.880]   And by innervate, I mean it sends little connections down
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.120]   to help guide what happens in these organs
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.840]   in the abdomen and chest.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.800]   It also collects information back,
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.720]   and there's information coming back from all those organs
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.680]   that also go through this vagus nerve,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.200]   the 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.520]   And so this is somewhat of a super highway to the brain then
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.340]   was the idea.
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.160]   And maybe the idea is maybe we could put a little cuff,
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   a little electrical device around the vagus nerve itself
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.680]   and maybe have just like a pacemaker battery,
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.360]   have a little power source here under the clavicle,
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.040]   everything under the skin,
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.940]   and have a little cuff and drive signals,
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.360]   and maybe they'll get back to the brain.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.920]   So a way of getting into the brain
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.700]   without putting something physical into the brain.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.760]   - And why the vagus?
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.880]   I mean, it's there, and it's accessible.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.800]   - That's the reason.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.640]   - That's the reason?
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.460]   - That's the reason, yes.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.300]   - Really? - Yeah.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.360]   - You're not kidding. - I'm not kidding.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.680]   - So stimulating the vagus to treat depression
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.400]   simply because it's accessible.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.420]   - It started as actually as an epilepsy treatment,
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.920]   and it can help with epilepsy, but yes,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.760]   it's simply because it's accessible.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.660]   - You got to love the medicine.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.900]   As a scientist, this is where I get to chuckle and just say,
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.220]   I mean, the field of medicine, from that perspective,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.160]   from the perspective of a scientist and outsider,
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.360]   the field of medicine as a field that goes in
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.820]   and tickles pathways because they're there,
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:44.620]   it's, I don't know what to say, it's a little shocking.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:45.460]   - Yeah.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.020]   - And we all, at least in my laboratory,
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.000]   I always say you never do an experiment because you can.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.040]   You do an experiment to test a specific hypothesis.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.600]   I mean, there are stories people tell.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.320]   So the vagus nerve lands on a particular spot on the brain
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.920]   called the solitary tract nucleus,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.280]   which is just one synapse away from the serotonin
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.680]   and dopamine and the norepinephrine.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.280]   - So there's a link to chemical systems in the brain
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.760]   that make it a rational choice.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.200]   - Yes, it's not irrational,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.340]   but I can tell you that even if that were not true,
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.800]   the same thing would have been tried, you know?
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.640]   - You actually would have done it anyways.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.900]   - Because it's accessible, yeah.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:24.980]   - I see, okay.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.940]   - And why?
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:31.940]   Well, it's, again, not to disparage what's been happening
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.920]   in this branch of medicine.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.180]   There's immense suffering, treatments,
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.780]   many treatments don't work, and we try things.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.980]   And this is how so many advances in medicine happen.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.640]   You think about kidney dialysis,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.680]   which has kept many people alive.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.360]   That was just started by someone saying,
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.720]   hey, let's try this.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.480]   Maybe there's something building up in the blood.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.400]   Maybe we can dialyze something and help them.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.240]   Yeah, it worked.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.640]   And it was just sort of a test pilot mentality.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.680]   We can access the blood.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.720]   Let's run it across a dialysis membrane,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.680]   put it back in the body.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.920]   Oh my God, that actually works.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   And sometimes you do need that test pilot mentality,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.120]   of course, to do it in a rigorous, safe, controlled way,
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:10.960]   which is what we do.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.520]   And so, anyway, that's how we ended up with,
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.640]   but still, with the vagus nerve stimulation,
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.720]   okay, so what does it, does it work?
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.780]   It has, it's FDA approved for depression,
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.080]   this vagus nerve stimulation.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.520]   But on a population level,
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.120]   if you average across all people,
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.720]   the effect sizes are pretty small.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.660]   Some patients it has an amazing effect in,
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.520]   but some patients it doesn't work at all.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.200]   And average across everybody,
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.480]   the effect size is pretty small.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.960]   - How do you think it's working when it does work?
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.420]   Is it triggering the activation of neurons
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.440]   that release more serotonin or dopamine?
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.080]   - It could be, but I would say
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.880]   we don't have evidence for that.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.480]   And so I just don't know.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.320]   But what is clear is that it's dose limited
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.280]   in how high and strongly we can stimulate and why.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.940]   It's because it's an electrode
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.460]   and it's stimulating everything nearby.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.680]   And when you turn on the vagus nerve stimulator,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.200]   the voice, patient's voice becomes strangulated and hoarse.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.040]   They can have trouble swallowing.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.340]   They can have trouble speaking for sure.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.000]   Even some trouble breathing
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.320]   because everything in the neck,
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.600]   every electrically responsive cell and projection
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.060]   in the neck is being affected by this electrode.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.040]   And so you can go up just so far with the intensity
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.720]   and then you have to stop.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.000]   So to your initial question,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.040]   could a more precise stimulation method
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.420]   like optogenetics help in this setting?
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.360]   In principle, it could,
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.120]   because if you would target the light sensitivity
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.800]   to just the right kind of cell,
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.060]   let's say cell X that goes from point A to point B
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.400]   that you know causes symptom relief of a particular kind,
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.240]   then you're in business.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.500]   You can have that be the only cell that's light sensitive.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.460]   You're not going to affect any of the other cells,
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.920]   the larynx and the pharynx
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.460]   and the projections passing through.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.300]   So that's the hope.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.120]   That's the opportunity.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.480]   The problem is that we don't yet have
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.900]   that level of specific knowledge.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.640]   We don't know, okay,
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.440]   it's the cell starting in point A going to point B
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.200]   that relieves this particular symptom.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.040]   - We want to fix this key on the piano.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.880]   - Yeah.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.980]   Then I see two other steps that are required.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.540]   One is to get the channelopsin gene into the cell.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.700]   In the case of Boton,
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.740]   Rosca and colleagues rescuing vision in this patient,
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:25.540]   they did that by an injection of a virus
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.620]   that doesn't damage the neurons.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.300]   The virus itself is fairly innocuous,
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.780]   but carries a cargo,
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.080]   and it's a one-time injection.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.060]   The cells express,
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.300]   and then they used light to stimulate.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.020]   So let's say I'm depressed,
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.140]   which I don't think I am,
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.940]   although now sitting in front of a psychiatrist,
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.920]   you probably can see signs that maybe I am,
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.020]   or maybe I'm not.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.600]   But let's say we put channelopsin
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.840]   into a specific branch of the vagus
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.580]   that we understand is responsible for mood.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.360]   How are we going to get it in there?
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.320]   And then how are we going to deliver the light?
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.760]   'Cause we're not talking about sunlight
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.260]   or standing in front of a light bulb necessarily,
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.020]   but what are the mechanisms for the body?
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.860]   - Yeah.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.580]   So we had to solve exactly these questions.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.920]   You're saying, how do you get the light in?
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.520]   How do you get the gene in,
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.640]   in a potent and robust and safe way?
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.000]   And that's now solved,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.760]   and that's not a challenge.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.480]   So there are very safe,
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.400]   well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.160]   that are called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.220]   And these are things that are associated
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.720]   with the common cold.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:39.360]   They themselves don't cause any symptoms.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.380]   They've been engineered,
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.400]   and there's been a broad community of viral engineering
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.660]   that's been going on for decades,
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.300]   making these safer, well-tolerated, and so on.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.920]   We can put the channelrhodopsin gene
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   into these viral vectors that deliver the gene,
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.560]   and we can have little bits of additional DNA
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.000]   that govern expression only in one kind of cell,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.840]   but not another.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.160]   These are called promoters and enhancers,
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.040]   all genetic tricks built up by a very broad community
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.840]   of great scientists over the decades.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.740]   We can put these different bits of DNA,
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.800]   package them into this AAV, this little virus,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.600]   and that can be then injected
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.400]   into a particular part of the body.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.220]   And sticking with this vagus nerve example,
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.600]   we know that there are particular clumps of neurons.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.880]   There's one called the nodos ganglion
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.040]   that has a clump of cells related to the vagus nerve,
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.260]   and you could, for example,
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.960]   target a little injection into that ganglion.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.600]   - Would that be an outpatient procedure?
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.240]   - Come in in the morning, get your injection,
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.680]   maybe walk out a few hours later.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:42.680]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.180]   And so that's the gene.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.380]   Then the light delivery.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.660]   This is also something that we've worked out.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.560]   We've worked on making very, very light-sensitive opsins.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.480]   One challenge, and Botand would be the first to state this,
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.120]   in fact, in solving this problem for the patient,
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   he had to build goggles that created much brighter light
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.740]   than the normal ambient light delivery.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.600]   Because as I mentioned earlier,
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.920]   you have to pack a lot of these channelrhodopsins in.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.640]   They don't have much current.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.200]   You have to really make sure
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.520]   that you've got a tense enough light
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.720]   to activate enough of them to cause a stimulation.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.120]   - And it has to be the right wavelength, correct?
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:23.960]   - It has to be the right wavelength.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.800]   - And going back to your example
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.480]   of the algae moving toward or away the light,
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.160]   it has to be tuned just right.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.400]   So could you, I'm imagining in my mind as a non-engineer,
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.840]   I know you're also a bioengineer,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:42.560]   I'm imagining a little tiny blue light emitting thing,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:47.200]   object that's a little bigger than a clump of cells
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.360]   or maybe about the size of a clump of cells.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.800]   And for those who don't know,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.560]   your credit card is about 200 microns thick on the side
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.760]   and a micron is a thousandths of a millimeter.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.160]   And so we're talking about a little tiny stamp
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:08.380]   that's basically half a millimeter in size all around.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.400]   Each edge, half a millimeter in size.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.840]   I can imagine that being put under my skin
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.560]   and then I would hit an app on my phone
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.220]   and I'd say, "Dr. Deisseroth, I'm not feeling great today.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:23.680]   Can I increase the stimulation?"
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.760]   And you say, "Go for it."
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.680]   And then I ramp it up.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.520]   Is that how it would go?
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.220]   - I mean, that's effectively what we already do
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:31.040]   with the vagus nerve stimulation, the doctor in this case.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.280]   And I have this in some of my patients in the clinic.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.480]   I do vagus nerve stimulation.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.320]   I talk to them.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.380]   I say, I go through the symptoms.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.100]   I use the psychiatric interview
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.200]   to elicit their internal states.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.060]   And then I have a radio frequency controller
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.620]   that I can dial in.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.460]   - Right there in real time.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.280]   - Right there in real time.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.480]   - You're holding the remote control
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.760]   essentially to their brain,
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.420]   although it's remote, remote control.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.460]   - Through a couple of steps, but yeah.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:56.400]   And I can turn up the frequency.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.420]   I can turn up the intensity
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:02.200]   all with the radio frequency and control.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.520]   And then it's reprogrammed or redosed.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:09.000]   And then the patient can then leave at this altered dose.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.100]   - So this is happening now.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.280]   - This is happening right now, electrically.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.200]   - You do this routinely.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.080]   - I do it routinely in my clinic, electrically.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.160]   - And you're getting the verbal content,
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.520]   which as you described earlier,
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.480]   is the indication of how well
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.400]   something is working in real time.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.280]   So maybe you could just describe a little bit
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.200]   of the interaction with that particular patient
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.300]   or another patient.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.460]   What's a typical arc of narrative
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:36.180]   as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation?
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:39.540]   - In most patients, the actual therapeutic effects,
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.980]   the benefits actually take many days to weeks.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:46.620]   And so what I'm mostly focusing on in the office
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.420]   in real time is making sure
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.300]   I'm in a safe, low side effect regime.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:53.460]   And so first I talked to the patient,
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.220]   who has been on a particular dose of the stimulation
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.700]   for weeks or longer.
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.500]   And I talked about symptoms.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.740]   How were things over the past month?
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.560]   How was your hope?
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.000]   How was your energy level?
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.020]   Sleep, what is your mood?
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.060]   And then we talk with the patient and we decide,
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.260]   oh, this is not yet where we'd like to be.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.740]   And so then I can turn up the intensity of the stimulation
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.460]   in real time in the office.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.100]   In most patients, I don't expect an immediate mood change.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.180]   What I do is I increase the dose
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.340]   until a next level up while asking the patient
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.180]   for side effects.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.460]   Can you still breathe okay?
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.820]   Can you still swallow okay?
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.220]   And I can hear their voice as well.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.060]   And I can get a sense--
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:33.900]   - And you're looking at their face.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.980]   - And I'm looking at their face.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.500]   And so I can get a sense, is there a,
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.420]   am I still in a safe side effect regime?
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:45.420]   And then I stop at a particular point that looks safe
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.460]   and then patient goes home, comes back a month later,
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.260]   and I get the report on how things were over that month.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.940]   I asked if you're looking at their face
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.040]   'cause in your book,
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.040]   you described the incredible complexity
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.860]   of social interactions.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.340]   And at one point,
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:09.100]   you described the incredible amount of information
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.260]   that the eyes inform about the brain
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.900]   and the context of somebody's inner experience,
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.180]   whether depressed or happy or otherwise.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.540]   I want to make sure that we get back
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.240]   to how to maneuver and manipulate the nervous system
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.420]   for sake of mental health.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.820]   But what are you looking for?
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.280]   So as a vision scientist,
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.140]   I think pupils dilating is a sign of arousal,
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.800]   but that could be a positive arousal,
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.260]   positive valence like excitement, or it could be terror.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.860]   You're going to get the same dilation of the pupils.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.940]   And I'm always reminding people
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.900]   that these two little goodies are two pieces of brain,
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.940]   basically, they're just outside the cranial vault.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.780]   So they're not unlike the vagus in that sense,
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.300]   but they're more of a report than a control knob,
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.720]   although I like to think they could be used
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.820]   as control knobs too.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:01.380]   So without putting you on the spot, again, to diagnose me,
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.300]   something I would never ask you to do
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.540]   with the cameras rolling,
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.940]   but what are you looking for
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:09.160]   that the patient might not be aware of?
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.560]   In other words, can you see depression in somebody's eyes?
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.220]   And if you know a patient or if you don't,
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:19.140]   can you see it in their body posture when they walk in?
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.380]   Realizing, of course, that a trained psychiatrist
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.260]   like yourself develops an intuitive sense
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:29.020]   that's aggregating lots of different features of a patient.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.220]   But what about the eyes?
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.060]   What's going on there?
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.580]   - The eyes are incredibly rich in information.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.560]   And as you allude to though,
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.900]   it's not as if any one measurable
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.420]   conveys all the information you need.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:46.140]   It's what an engineer would say joint statistics.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.020]   It's many things all at once,
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.060]   whether they're in synchrony or out of synchrony
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.700]   that actually turns out to matter.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.980]   And the eye contact question,
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.120]   we all know eye contact is incredibly important.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.620]   You don't feel you've connected with somebody
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.420]   unless there's eye contact.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.260]   But eye contact can go awry too.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.260]   It can be too intense or it can be mistimed
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:15.540]   or if there's someone with autism,
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.300]   it can be barely there at all.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:21.260]   And this is one of the most striking symptoms of autism
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.980]   is the avoidance of eye contact
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:31.660]   almost as if it's a harmful quantity.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:35.180]   And so there's an immense amount of information
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.440]   you get from the eyes,
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.380]   but it's the pairing of what's going on in the eyes
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.160]   with everything else going on, the body language,
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.900]   the verbal content of what's coming out.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.620]   All that together is the art of psychiatry
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.180]   and social interaction.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.180]   But sometimes you don't have the eye contact.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.280]   And this is an amazing thing.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.140]   And I do talk about this in the book as well.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.540]   In many cases in psychiatry,
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.620]   sometimes it's over the phone
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.120]   that you have to make key decisions.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.120]   And I recall vividly being as a resident very often
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.720]   you have to take these phone calls
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.080]   from people who are not in the hospital,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.300]   people you can't see.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.360]   You can't see their eye, you can't see their body,
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.200]   anything about them, just the sound of their voice.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.720]   And you can ask them questions
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.480]   and you have to make, in some cases, life or death decisions.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.720]   Is this person truly suicidal?
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.120]   Something like that as it comes up all the time.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.800]   And so I developed over the course of training
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.840]   and I think all psychiatrists do this
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.980]   is you develop a way to whatever data stream you have,
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.480]   whether it's the eyes or whether it's just the sound
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.520]   of a voice coming over the phone,
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.720]   you learn to home in on that data stream you have
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.340]   and focus on it and identify changes.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.600]   And it's quite amazing.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.360]   I found that you can actually, if you know a patient,
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.720]   you can detect very precise changes in mood
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.180]   just from the sound of the voice.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.000]   And you can have a realization
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.400]   that, oh, this patient's depression has improved
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.600]   by about half, just by the tone of their voice.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.400]   And same with eyes, with enough practice,
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.760]   you can get enough information from a single data stream
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.380]   to give you some information.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.940]   But when you do have the whole picture,
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.860]   that of course is best.
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.240]   - So many theories out there
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.000]   about excessive blinking and lying,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.080]   lack of blinking and sociopathy.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.400]   I like to remind people that people have varying degrees
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.620]   of lubrication of the eyes,
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.740]   which also influence the frequency of blinking
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.880]   and presumably have nothing to do with whether or not
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.800]   what they're saying is true or not.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.320]   But incredible nonetheless,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.520]   that the eyes are a portal to overall arousal state.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.020]   I'm fascinated by the effects of light on circadian biology
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.600]   and just overall desire to be awake or asleep, et cetera.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.440]   - So the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.820]   The vagus is outside the cranial vault, obviously.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.520]   What about the goodies in here?
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.040]   Parkinson's, we know at least one of the major sites
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.320]   of degeneration and failure that lead to those symptoms.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.860]   I can name off any number of other things.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.560]   In your book, you talk about the beautiful work
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.520]   done with optogenetics of active versus passive coping,
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.600]   that there are areas of the brain,
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.920]   like the habenula that make, when active, make animals
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.660]   and presumably people passive and unwilling
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:42.160]   or uninterested in fighting back against pressures of life.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.120]   Whereas another region, the raphe, you stimulate that
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.520]   and they actively cope, they get their grit going
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.860]   and they are able to lean into life.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:56.860]   So how does one get to those structures in a focused way?
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.540]   And what does the next two to five to 10 years look like?
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:05.420]   - Yeah, well, this is the promise on that
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.220]   and it is on that timescale
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.800]   that I think things may start to play out.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.880]   You know, the specificity of optogenetics
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.220]   is really only useful if you have some idea
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.460]   of how to use that specificity.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.860]   And it's an actually, it's a frustrating aspect
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.300]   of psychiatry that in many cases,
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.940]   the most effective treatments we have
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.940]   have the least specificity.
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:33.280]   Electroconvulsive therapy being a great example
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.880]   where you're causing a brain-wide-
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.680]   - Which looks barbaric, but as you mentioned, is effective.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.700]   - I mean, it is, these days, it's much more clinically-
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.860]   - It doesn't look like one flu,
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:45.260]   the last seen in one flu over the cuckoo's nest.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.980]   - Now it's a very clinically safe and stable procedure,
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.400]   but where I would say, yeah,
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.260]   it's got this almost medieval lack of specificity.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.140]   Even if the procedure is well-controlled
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.740]   and clinically safe and stable,
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.700]   and it has a, it's not very specific.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.220]   You're causing a brain-wide seizure.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.200]   How could you be less specific than that?
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.980]   - And we don't know the source of the relief.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.320]   We don't, presumably it's a dump of neuromodulators
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.060]   like dopamine and serotonin, but we don't-
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.880]   - There certainly is a dump of neuromodulators.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.180]   We don't know that that's the cause for the relief.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.180]   And likewise with medications,
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.740]   this is also an interesting thing.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.140]   Some of the most effective antidepressants,
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.200]   some of the most effective anti-psychotics
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.700]   are the ones that have the most side effects.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.980]   And many examples of this, for example,
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.160]   the most effective anti-psychotic
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.980]   is something called clozapine,
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.700]   which has, it's unquestionably has the most side effects.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.000]   It had terrible, terrible side effects.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.300]   - Is it D4 antagonist?
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.820]   - It has basically every receptor.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.660]   - Does it really?
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.500]   - Yeah, it acts- - Interesting.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.000]   - Yeah, it has prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.840]   certainly acts on dopamine receptors,
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   but it causes blood cell counts to change.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.360]   - How do people feel?
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.040]   So if I were schizophrenic
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.200]   and I was getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.200]   and I took clozapine, what could I expect to feel?
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.520]   - Well, so you would notice side effects
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.520]   and you would notice resolution of symptoms both and-
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.160]   - So the voices would go away in a good situation.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.360]   The voices would go away,
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.680]   but I would feel not good in my body.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.240]   - You would have, you might have dizziness,
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.800]   you might have drooling,
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.240]   you might have any number of physical sensations
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.160]   that would be due to these off-target effects,
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.520]   the medication acting on these other receptors.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.760]   - And I'm certainly not suggesting this,
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.280]   but what if somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.320]   - They had the same side effects, presumably, yeah.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:50.920]   And so it would not be something that I would recommend.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.560]   - Do psychiatrists take the drugs that they prescribe?
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.720]   I just finished, for the third time,
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.640]   Oliver Sacks' autobiography, which is marvelous
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.080]   and I highly recommend to people.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.820]   He certainly took a lot of drugs,
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.120]   not as part of his professional role,
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.040]   but just out of curiosity,
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.720]   what is the interest or kind of role of drugs
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.960]   in the field of psychiatry?
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.640]   Because I would imagine for a group of very curious,
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.440]   introspective people who are making recommendations
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.600]   about what to take,
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.440]   there could actually be some benefit
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.960]   for understanding what the experience of those drugs
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.320]   was like for their patients.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.800]   - I think that's true.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.200]   And I will say that probably many or most psychiatrists
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.360]   have sampled a number of these
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.040]   for exactly the reason that you're saying
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.520]   is to understand better
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.080]   and to help treat their patients better.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.080]   And I've spoken to people who have really been,
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.040]   have found this very helpful to know,
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.320]   okay, this sleep disruption caused by this medication
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.240]   or the libido disruption caused by this other medication,
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.160]   wow, that is a big effect.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.640]   And it really helps with empathy
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.440]   for the patients to understand.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.520]   - I'm not suggesting that physicians
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.640]   or anybody experiment with drugs,
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.440]   but I am relieved to hear that
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.640]   because I think that when you're talking about
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.540]   accessing somebody's mind and their basic physiology,
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.480]   as you mentioned, relate to appetite, libido, and sleep,
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.720]   you really, one is acting as a mechanic
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.800]   of the person's whole experience.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.720]   They walk out of the office
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.320]   and they have a life experience
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.840]   that extends beyond the script.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.360]   - And so, yeah, and so at the same time though,
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.740]   you can't let that completely guide your clinical decisions
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.900]   because as I mentioned,
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.440]   some of these medications that have the most side effects,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.160]   they are also the most effective.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.580]   And clozapine's a great example.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.460]   That will work in patients where nothing else works.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:43.300]   And believe me,
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.680]   we don't take the step of clozapine prescription lightly
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.260]   because of all these side effects.
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.640]   You have to come in for a weekly blood cell
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.420]   or every few weeks of blood cell check
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.800]   to make sure that the blood counts are not off, for example.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.580]   But there are patients where no other medication works
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.320]   for the schizophrenia and clozapine works amazingly well.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.280]   And so we do it even though there are the side effects.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.300]   And so then this comes back to your question,
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.820]   what if we had better and better specificity?
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:12.940]   Well, only if we know exactly what we're doing is the point.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.880]   And so, because as we become more refined,
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.240]   we better be right about where we're refining to.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.560]   - And you imagine a day where it will be a single,
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.280]   maybe even outpatient neurosurgery
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.380]   would go in through the skull or the back of the ear,
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.960]   deliver a small viral injection
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.560]   of one of these adenoviruses,
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.520]   a little sticker of light emitting diode.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.320]   Is that deep in the brain?
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.560]   Is that how you envision this someday?
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.680]   - That certainly could happen.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.680]   What I actually prefer as a vision is still medications
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.720]   because those are minimally invasive.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.840]   If we knew what we were doing,
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.940]   we could make them more specific, have fewer side effects,
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.100]   but optogenetics that'll arm us
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.020]   with true causal understanding.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.980]   And so we'll know,
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.440]   and we're already moving rapidly toward this point,
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.480]   we'll know, okay, this symptom,
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.280]   the loss of pleasure in life that we call anhedonia
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.180]   or the loss of motivation or energy
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.360]   to overcome challenges, active coping,
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.540]   these are largely subserved,
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:21.680]   largely controlled by this circuit or that circuit
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.160]   or the cell that inhabits this other circuit.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.040]   - And we will know that
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.380]   because of the work done with channel ops.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.720]   - Exactly. - Yeah, I agree.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.260]   - In ways that we never could have the confidence otherwise.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.680]   And so we'll know that this is the circuit that underlies
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.560]   the symptom or its resolution.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.880]   And then we'll get to understand these cells very deeply.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.520]   Okay, these cells that are causal, that do matter,
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.800]   who are they?
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.820]   What's their wiring?
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.120]   What are the proteins that they make?
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.040]   What are the little things that are on the surface
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.560]   of the cell that could be receptors for specific medications
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.280]   or combinations of receptors
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.820]   that would give us the specificity we need?
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:06.440]   And then armed with that causal and precise
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.340]   and rigorous knowledge,
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.980]   then you can imagine medication development
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.200]   becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.360]   but truly grounded in causality.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.760]   - I see, so using channel ops sense
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.160]   as a way to probe the circuitry
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.940]   and figure out the sites that are disrupted,
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.860]   what patterns of activity are required,
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.360]   and then by understanding the constituents of those cells,
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.000]   like what they express and what they make,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.840]   then developing drugs that could target those cells,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.920]   not necessarily putting light-inducing diodes into the brain
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.120]   or walking around with wire packs attached to our skull
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.840]   or something like that.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.840]   That's fantastic, and I realize no one has a crystal ball,
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.360]   but what do you think the arc of that is?
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.000]   Meaning, are we going to see that in a year,
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.360]   in two years, three years?
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.380]   Let me reframe that.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.840]   How soon will a pill-based treatment
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.040]   for a psychiatric disease be available
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.320]   that targets a specific set of cells
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.900]   that we know are important
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.920]   because of the work done with channel ops sense?
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.440]   - I think that is, in some ways,
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.080]   it's already happening at the level of individual patients.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.960]   - Here at Stanford?
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   - Yeah, yep, and more broadly in terms of new drugs,
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.880]   new multicenter clinical trials
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.180]   that'll play out over the next few years.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:36.280]   And these could be drugs that are already safe
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.360]   and approved for other purposes,
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.320]   but we might say, okay, now we know that this medication,
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.440]   based on what we know from causal optogenetics,
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.520]   this could be useful for this other purpose,
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.680]   this psychiatric symptom.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.680]   And so the path to helping patients could be relatively swift.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.680]   - That's very exciting.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.880]   What are your thoughts about brain-machine interface?
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.720]   And Neuralink always comes up,
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.880]   although I do want to point out it,
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.800]   tremendous respect for the folks at Neuralink,
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.480]   including someone who came up through my lab
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.680]   is now there as a neurosurgeon,
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.920]   but the brain-machine interface is something
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.160]   that's been happening for a long time now.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   Some of the best work,
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.100]   among the best work being done here at Stanford
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.320]   and elsewhere too, of course.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.980]   How is what you just described compatible with
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.740]   or different than brain-machine interface?
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.800]   Meaning devices, little probes,
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.600]   they're going to stimulate different patterns of activity
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.400]   and ensembles of neurons.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.680]   And what are your general thoughts
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.240]   about brain-machine interface as going forward?
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.300]   - Yeah, I mean, this is, first of all,
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.240]   it's an amazing scientific discovery approach.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.360]   As you mentioned, we and others here at Stanford
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.160]   are using electrodes, collecting information
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.500]   from tens of thousands of neurons.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.340]   - In humans, I should add.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:00.320]   - And even, yes, there's quite even separate
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.120]   from the Neuralink work, as you point out,
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.100]   many people have been doing this in humans
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.800]   as well as in non-human primates.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.280]   And this is pretty powerful.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.120]   It's important.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.680]   This will let us understand what's going on in the brain
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.080]   in psychiatric disease, in neurological disease,
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.100]   and will give us ideas for treatment.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:24.740]   It is, of course, it's still invasive.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:29.740]   You still are talking about putting a device into the brain
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:35.080]   and that has to be treated as a situation
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.760]   that has some risks
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.360]   and a step that has to be taken carefully.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.580]   I see that as something that will be part of psychiatry
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.940]   in the long run.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.020]   Already with deep brain stimulation approaches,
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:54.640]   we can help people with psychiatric disorders
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.520]   and that's putting just a single electrode,
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.260]   not even a complex closed loop system
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.780]   where you're both playing in and getting information back.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:05.960]   Even just a single stimulation electrode in the brain
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.060]   can help people with OCD, for example, quite powerfully.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.680]   And that will become much more powerful
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.980]   when we get to a true brain machine interface,
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:17.320]   collecting information back,
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.880]   stimulating only when you need to.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.280]   If we could identify a pathological activity pattern,
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.640]   a particular, almost like the prodrome
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.080]   or the early stage of a seizure,
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.320]   maybe there are events that happen leading up to,
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.600]   on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.280]   We could intervene in a closed loop way,
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.240]   detect what's happening, what's starting to go wrong,
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.280]   feed that back to the brain stimulation electrode,
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.280]   have it be in that way more efficient and more principled.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.320]   This is, I think, it's great.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.400]   It's something that of course will be grounded again
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.380]   in causal understanding.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.720]   We'll need to know what is that pathological pattern
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.040]   that we're detecting and we need to know that it matters.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.280]   And so again, that's where optogenetics is helping us
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.160]   and helping us know, okay, this pattern of activity
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.620]   in these cells, in these circuits,
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:10.280]   this does mean that there's a particular kind of symptom
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.120]   that's happening.
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.260]   But armed with that knowledge, absolutely.
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:17.560]   Even the simple closed loop device detect and stimulate
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.260]   is going to be part of psychiatry in the future.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:22.600]   And then of course, as you get to more cells,
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.720]   more connections, the ability that we have to help people
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.020]   will become more powerful.
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:32.120]   - One of the questions I get asked a lot is about ADHD
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.980]   and attention deficit of various kinds.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:39.160]   I have the hunch that one reason I get asked so often
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.280]   is that people are feeling really distracted
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.020]   and challenged in funneling their attention
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.100]   and their behavior.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:51.200]   But, and there are a number of reasons for that, of course.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.000]   But what is true ADHD?
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.460]   And what does it look like?
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.960]   What can be done for it?
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.360]   And what, if any, role for channel options
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.720]   or these downstream technologies that you're developing?
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.440]   What do they offer for people that suffer from ADHD
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   or have a family member that suffers from ADHD?
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:16.760]   - This is a pretty interesting branch of psychiatry.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.620]   There's no question that people have been helped
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.600]   by the treatments.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:25.440]   There's active debate over what fraction of people
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.800]   who have these symptoms can or should be treated.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.840]   - This is typically Adderall or stimulants of some kind.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.680]   - For example, the stimulants, that's right.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:39.360]   So ADHD, as its name suggests, it has symptoms of,
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.860]   it can have either a hyperactive state
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.360]   or an inattentive state.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.040]   And those can be completely separate from each other.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.460]   You could have a patient who effectively
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.080]   is not hyperactive at all,
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:57.040]   but can't remain focused on what's going on around them.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.440]   - So their body can be still,
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.600]   but their mind is darting around.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.440]   - That's right.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.320]   - Or they can be very hyperactive with their body.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.160]   - Yeah, it happens both ways.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.080]   - Probably rarely is somebody hyperactive with their body,
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.280]   but their mind is still.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.120]   Although I have to say,
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.040]   and this is a benevolent shout out to Botan Roska,
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.380]   Botan has an incredibly sharp and focused mind.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:17.960]   And his hand movements are extremely exact also.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.440]   So I do sometimes wonder whether or not our body movements
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.920]   and our head movements are,
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.520]   whether or not they're coordinated or not is a readout
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.480]   of how directed our attention is.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.360]   - I notice I have to think complex, abstract thoughts.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.960]   I notice I have to be very still.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.000]   So my body has to be almost completely unmoving
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.580]   for me to think very abstractly and deeply.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.580]   Other people are different.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:41.760]   Some people, when they're running,
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.760]   they get their best thoughts.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.060]   I can't even imagine that.
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.800]   My brain does not work that way at all.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.840]   I have to be totally motionless,
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.860]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.000]   - How do you go about that?
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.720]   - I sit much like this.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.120]   I try to have time in each day
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.120]   where I am literally sitting almost in this position,
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.160]   but without distraction and thinking.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.760]   And so it's kind of a,
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.400]   it's almost meditative in some ways,
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   except it's not a true meditation,
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.940]   but I am thinking while not moving.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.580]   - You're trying to structure your thoughts in that time.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.500]   - Yeah, that's right. - Interesting.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.720]   - So, but everybody, as you say, is very different.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.160]   And so with ADHD, you have,
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.560]   the key thing is we want to make sure
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.960]   that this is present across different domains of life,
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.460]   school and home,
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.800]   to show that it really is a pervasive pattern
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.480]   and not something specific to the teacher
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.000]   or the home situation or something.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.160]   And then you can help patients.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.540]   It's interesting that ADHD is one of those disorders
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.880]   where people are trying to work
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.580]   on quantitative EEG-based diagnoses.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:50.760]   And so there's some progress toward making up a diagnosis
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.400]   with looking at particular externally
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.320]   detectable brainwave rhythms.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.020]   - So skull cap with some electrodes
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.280]   that don't penetrate the skull.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.120]   - That's right.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.720]   - And this can be done in an hour or two hour session.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:02.560]   - That's right.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.940]   - Has to be done in a clinic, right?
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:04.940]   - Yeah, in the clinic, right,
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.620]   you have to have the right recording apparatus and so on,
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:12.620]   but that's in principle as increasing confidence
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.440]   comes in exactly which measurements
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:20.500]   one could even imagine moving toward home tests,
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.420]   but we're not there yet.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.260]   - Amazing.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.260]   I think one of the reasons I get asked about it so much
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.980]   is a lot of people wonder if they have ADHD.
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:30.820]   Do you think that some of the lifestyle factors
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.480]   that inhabit us all these days
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:39.260]   could induce a subclinical or a clinical-like ADHD,
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:42.700]   meaning if I look at people's phone use, including my own,
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.460]   and I don't think of it like addiction,
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.060]   it looks to me and feels to me more like OCD.
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.940]   And I'll come clean here by saying when I was younger,
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.340]   when I was a kid, I had a grunting tic.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.180]   I used to hide it.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.500]   I actually used to hide in the closet
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.700]   'cause my dad would make me stop.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.180]   And I used to, I couldn't feel any relief of my mind
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.540]   until I would do this.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.940]   And actually now, if I get very tired,
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.540]   if I've been pushing long hours, it'll come back.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.960]   I was not treated for it,
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:11.740]   but I will confess that I've had the experience of,
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.440]   I always liked sports where I involved a lot of impact,
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.940]   fortunately not football, because I went to high school
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.420]   where the football team was terrible.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.280]   Maybe that would have avoided more impact,
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.600]   but things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.980]   I feel clarity after a head hit, which I avoid.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.080]   But I used to say that's the only time
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.720]   I feel truly clear for a long,
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.200]   and then eventually it dissipated.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.720]   By about age 16, 17, it just disappeared.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.000]   So I have great empathy for those that feel
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.600]   like there's something contained in them
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.840]   that won't allow them to focus
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.560]   on what they want to focus on.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:49.080]   And these days with the phone and all these email, et cetera,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:53.200]   I wonder, and I empathize a bit when I hear people saying
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.520]   like, "I think I might have ADHD or ADD."
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.200]   Do you think it's possible that our behaviors
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.600]   and our interaction with the sensory world,
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.900]   which is really what phones and email really are,
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.720]   could induce ADD or reactivate it?
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.440]   - This is a great question.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.640]   I think about it a lot.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.560]   And you mentioned this tic-like behavior in yourself.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:19.280]   It's very common that people who have tics
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.840]   have this building up of something
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.360]   that can only be relieved by executing the tic,
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.000]   which can be a motor movement or vocalization
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.440]   or even a thought.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.560]   And people do, I think these days do have this,
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.240]   if they haven't checked their phone in a while,
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.140]   they do have a buildup, a buildup, a buildup
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.560]   until they can check it and relieve it.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.040]   And there's some similarities.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.800]   There is a little reward that comes with the checking.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.800]   But the key question in all of psychiatry,
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.980]   what we do is we don't diagnose something
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   unless it's disrupting what we call social
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.320]   or occupational functioning.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.200]   Like you could have any number of symptoms,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.440]   but literally every psychiatric diagnosis
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.680]   requires that it has to be disrupting
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.400]   someone's social or occupational functioning.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.040]   And these days, checking your phone is pretty adaptive.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.840]   That pretty much helps your social
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.000]   and occupational functioning.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.760]   And so we can't make it a psychiatric diagnosis
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.000]   that's interesting, at least in the world of today.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.360]   - Yeah, opting out of communication now
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.360]   makes you in some ways less adaptive,
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.800]   though I would point to you as an example
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:34.480]   of somebody who is quite good at managing his interactions,
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.760]   at least from the outsider perspective.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.500]   I do want to ask you a little bit about you.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:44.500]   And first of all, and I realize this is only a partial list,
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.080]   but you're a clinician, you see patients,
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.220]   you run a big laboratory.
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.440]   How many people are in your laboratory now?
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.840]   That's a huge laboratory.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.800]   From experience, I can say that's an enormous laboratory.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.940]   You have a family of five children
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.400]   and you're happily married
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.620]   to a wonderful colleague of ours as well
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.380]   who does incredible work.
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:13.940]   How do you organize at a kind of conceptual level
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:15.700]   the day and the week?
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.740]   And I should say what stress mitigation practices, if any,
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:21.700]   do you incorporate?
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.540]   I've received emails from you at three in the morning.
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.040]   I sometimes send emails at three in the morning,
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.400]   but that's when I wake up, maybe I'm depressed,
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.060]   but I go back to sleep.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:34.680]   So maybe you just describe the arc of the blocks of the day,
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.960]   not hour by hour,
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.240]   necessarily the details of what are in those blocks,
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.120]   but how do you conceptualize the day?
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.540]   How do you conceptualize the week?
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.920]   And how do you feel about how that's lined up
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.380]   with your larger goals
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:53.900]   of making sure these five young people flourish,
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.100]   which I hear they are.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.300]   But how do you go about this?
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.720]   What for most people would just be
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.340]   an overwhelming set of items?
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:07.340]   - Well, of course, sometimes it's just to take it day by day
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:10.980]   and so I don't claim-
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:13.120]   - So you bring the horizon into the unit of the day.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.200]   - I do, I do.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.760]   The unit is the day, that's right.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.520]   And what I try to have in each day,
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.660]   as I mentioned earlier,
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:26.400]   some, at least an hour of time where I can think.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.520]   And that can be, it can be when kids are napping,
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.080]   it can be, you know,
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.140]   actually, because like while driving, I can do that too,
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.440]   because I'm sitting still.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:42.320]   But that's the one thing I try to preserve.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.420]   When I was writing the book,
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.960]   I adapted that time to be my writing time,
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.400]   but it wasn't enough.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.140]   It's, you know, so I had to add in a new block of time,
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:56.340]   which was sort of midnight to 2 a.m. writing time.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:02.700]   And so that, carving out these even small protected times
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.140]   are very important.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:05.880]   There's, of course, you know,
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.580]   obligations will expand to fill the time available
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:10.780]   and you have to be disciplined.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.420]   In my, at least I found I had to be disciplined
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:18.200]   in truly protecting those times where one can think.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.620]   - So that means no phone.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.080]   - That means no phone, no checking of the phone.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.460]   I would, you know, when I was writing the book,
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:30.460]   I would have, there's a focus mode on the MacBook,
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:35.940]   which kind of removes the border
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.520]   and you just have your document and it's very pure
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.760]   and you don't have the temptation of distraction.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.460]   - I'm a big believer in,
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:48.560]   because the vision and the eyes play such a prominent role
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.720]   in directing our cognition,
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.040]   something you talk about in the book really beautifully
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.940]   and with a lot of depth and rigor,
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:30:00.800]   using visual tools to harness one's complete mental
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.820]   attention.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:04.480]   When you do this practice of sitting and just thinking,
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.640]   sitting still and thinking, you said your eyes are open.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.680]   Are you hearing your own verbal voice,
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.080]   although in your head?
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.360]   So you're actually in conversation with yourself.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.320]   - Yes, and hearing literally, I mean, not quite literally.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.620]   I don't actually hear a phonation, but I'm hearing words.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:26.580]   And so it's, I discovered this about myself, other people,
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.600]   I think, you know, may operate differently,
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.280]   but I'm extremely verbal in how I think.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.860]   That's how all my reasoning is done.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:38.860]   That's with sentences and construction of, you know,
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:41.060]   almost equations with words.
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.300]   - The complete sentences?
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.860]   - Complete sentences, or completish anyway, mostly complete.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.740]   And then, and when writing the book,
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:50.540]   everything about the writing, I would always,
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:54.180]   every sentence was always played out in my mind,
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.860]   listening for rhythm and timing.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:01.260]   And I would obsess over exact placement of words
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.480]   to get the right rhythm of the spoken sentence
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.960]   in my mind.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.360]   - I don't mean to interrupt your flow,
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.080]   but when you do that,
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.240]   and having experienced this process a bit,
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.300]   although differently,
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.200]   do you experience any kind of welling up of anxiety
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.000]   when you're hitting the friction points?
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.440]   And if so, do you have tools
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:24.040]   or ways that you quell that anxiety in real time?
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.980]   'Cause what we're really talking about here is your mind,
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.120]   but what we're really talking about is this process
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.920]   of converting the activity of neurons
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:36.240]   into something physically concrete in the world.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.480]   And these intermediate steps are so mysterious to everybody.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.860]   We hear, you know, just write the book, just do it,
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.180]   whatever that means.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.480]   In fact, the statements like that to me
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.180]   are kind of empty and meaningless.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:49.400]   But when you hear your voice
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.600]   and you're trying to find the correct word
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.680]   and you keep hitting, it doesn't sound quite right.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.160]   What is the experience in your body?
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.000]   - Yeah, when it's not right,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   it's definitely, it's aversive, it doesn't feel good,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.580]   but it's not, but there's also a hope
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.200]   because I know I can solve it too.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.380]   And so there's this,
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.600]   it's almost like you're almost there.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.200]   There's a path that you know is there.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.480]   You don't quite see it, but it's there.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.140]   And I keep that in mind.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:29.140]   And so there's this propulsive force forward
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.520]   because I know that the solution is there.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   And that said, there were single words
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.600]   that I would spend days on
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.360]   because I was just not happy until I got it right.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.380]   And there were some things that I never quite got perfect.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.080]   And so I left out of the book entirely
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.400]   because it was so close, but not quite there.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.640]   And so at the end I was like, no, I can't put that in.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.440]   - Everything you just said is entirely consistent
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:00.440]   with my experience of you and the way you go about everything.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.980]   I have to ask, are your kids writers?
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.240]   Do they like books and words and poetry?
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.160]   I know one of your children is going on
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.240]   to a career in medicine and science.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.680]   - Yeah, they're each different, which is amazing.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.400]   Yet they all, I think do have some appreciation
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.120]   or a lot of appreciation for reading,
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.000]   but some are very musical.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.520]   Two of the five are extremely musical, very, very talented
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:27.280]   with guitar and singing and vocal impressions.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.640]   It's just astonishing.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:32.920]   And some of them are great with drawing and artistry
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.660]   and some are very physical and vigorous
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:39.320]   and are never happy except when leaping about.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.420]   And so it's just amazing how different they are honestly.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.040]   But I think there is a shared appreciation for language.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.900]   - Do you think that one can train their mind
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.040]   in using these practices?
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.920]   - I really like your description of the sitting,
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.720]   staying physically still and learning to grapple
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.620]   with those challenges.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.140]   It's something that, especially in laboratory science,
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.520]   we aren't really trained to do.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.400]   Like many professions, we're taught to come in
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.080]   and just get into motion.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.000]   And I found that very relaxing as someone
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   who probably has an underlying tick or something like that.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.340]   It felt great to be in motion.
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.180]   One of the hardest things
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:18.880]   about becoming a university professor and running a lab
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.680]   was that I was no longer working with my hands.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.640]   And it felt like some big important part of my life
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.160]   had been amputated.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.100]   But what sorts of practices do you incorporate there?
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:35.520]   And do you think people can learn to get better at focusing
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.780]   through a dedicated practice of the sort that you describe?
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:44.240]   - I think that I also, I remember the rhythms
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.600]   of physical work in the laboratory very well.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:54.200]   My work these days as a laboratory leader,
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.040]   my job is returned mostly to words now again.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.400]   And so it's kind of coming full circle.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.360]   So it's a different mode.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.040]   I think you just have to embrace
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:09.240]   that different stages of life come with different modes,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.240]   but you can definitely train yourself for each mode.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.080]   I was not,
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:17.560]   I loved, as I mentioned,
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.480]   the rhythm of sewing and suturing and surgery.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.960]   And I worked really hard on that and became good at it.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.440]   And now I never do it, but it's what's the next challenge.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.720]   You know, there's all the various experimental techniques,
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.080]   the dissections of the brain, you know,
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.200]   I can't tell you how many thousands of brain dissections
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.280]   I've done in my life, and now I don't do them at all.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.480]   - And then you developed a method
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.200]   so that we don't have to dissect brains.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.800]   As you mentioned, maybe tell us for a moment about clarity
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.600]   and for people who will probably never set foot
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.840]   into a laboratory, what an incredible,
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.840]   yet another incredible discovery and development clarity is
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.360]   and why it helps us understand how the brain is structured.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.840]   - Yeah, so this is a different technology
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.840]   also developed in my lab here,
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.000]   and it's part of a broader approach
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.240]   that we call hydrogel tissue chemistry.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.240]   And what this is is it's building a gel,
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.400]   like a clear and jello-like substance
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.000]   from within all the cells of a tissue
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.920]   or even an animal all at once.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.440]   So you're building, effectively building a gel
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.800]   inside all the cells at once.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.920]   Now that's an odd thing to do.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:31.760]   Why do we do it?
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.000]   Well, we do it to transform the tissue
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.840]   into a more tractable, accessible object.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.200]   And the reason that works is having built this gel,
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.120]   this new infrastructure inside the tissue.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.720]   We can then use chemical tricks
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.440]   and we can link the molecules we care about,
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.920]   like proteins or RNAs, which are the things, as you know,
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.960]   right before they become proteins.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:02.960]   We can link them, physically anchor them to this gel,
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.480]   which is a scaffold, basically.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.960]   It's an interlocking network of polymers.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.640]   We can link all these interesting molecules in place,
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.280]   lock them in where they were initially,
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.400]   in the tissue, in the cell, in all the cells.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.520]   And then we can remove, very vigorously,
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:21.840]   everything we don't care about that's blocking our light,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.940]   that's blocking our molecules coming in
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:26.520]   to exchange information with the tissue.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.080]   We can get rid of everything else,
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.420]   like the lipids, the fats.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:33.560]   We can effectively use detergents to get them all out.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.600]   And then we can see in all the things
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.080]   that were absorbing our scattering light are gone.
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.760]   You can have a brain that's completely transparent
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.320]   and yet all the interesting molecules
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.560]   are still locked into place there
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.720]   at the cellular and subcellular level.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.620]   And so this is hydrogel tissue chemistry.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:50.840]   The first form we described was called clarity.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.440]   We use that quite a bit still,
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.920]   but there are many variants now that we and others
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.360]   have developed on this basic concept of building this gel
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.560]   within the tissue and anchoring molecules into place.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.120]   - Literally glass clear brains.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:05.320]   I've done this, I've taken a brain clear with this method
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.880]   and looked at somebody through it.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.800]   And although you don't want to get it too close to your eye,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.240]   you don't want to touch it to your own eye.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:13.440]   But, and you can see direct all the way through it.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:18.200]   That's incredible for the,
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.700]   it raises an important question,
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.160]   which is again about the human brain.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.880]   I mean, as somebody who essentially started out
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.480]   in neuroanatomy and then got into other things,
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.320]   I always am bothered by the fact
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.880]   that we actually know very little
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.760]   about the microstructure of the human brain
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.580]   compared to the brains of other organisms.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.400]   And in thinking about understanding the circuitry
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.580]   and the piano, so to speak, that,
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:47.660]   and how to manipulate it in order to relieve suffering,
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:53.480]   one wonders are the structures in these animal brains
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.720]   and how they behave and active coping,
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.000]   passive coping, ADD, et cetera, those models,
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.900]   how well they translate to the human condition.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:05.020]   Do you think it's fair to say
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:08.080]   that there are entire regions of the human brain
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.460]   that aren't just bigger,
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.500]   but that exist only in the brains of humans,
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.840]   especially given that we have this speech,
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.000]   although I do wonder sometimes if, you know,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.940]   animals are reporting to each other there,
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.780]   maybe they have little psychiatric sessions
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.300]   with one another.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.900]   - You know, I'm always careful
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.980]   to not assume we do things better.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:29.460]   We certainly understand what we're doing better
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.000]   than we understand what animals are doing,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.980]   and they certainly do things better than we do.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:36.820]   That said, we do have amazing, wonderful brains
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:39.420]   and many structures that are very highly developed
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:42.300]   in our brains that are not nearly so developed
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.420]   in mice and fish, for example.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:49.220]   Now, that said, when I look at the big picture,
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:52.880]   you know, what is the mammalian brain really doing?
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.020]   There are things that you would never have thought
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:01.900]   we could study in animals, in laboratory mammals like mice,
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.780]   that it turns out you can, actually.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:08.140]   And so I would never draw the line and say,
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:10.100]   here's something you can't study in mice,
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.740]   or here's something that has no parallel in mice.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.540]   I would be very careful before making
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:17.160]   any statement like that.
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.040]   A good example of that is we've been able to study
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:19.960]   just in the past year,
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.500]   come to an understanding of dissociation.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:26.180]   And both, we had a paper that came out in late 2020,
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.660]   both mouse and human work,
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.420]   in which we got to the sort of the circuit basis
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.100]   for dissociation.
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:35.540]   Now, what is dissociation?
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:38.760]   A lot of people might not have experienced it,
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.500]   but it's actually very common.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:44.260]   More than 70% of people who've been through trauma
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:45.820]   experience dissociation.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.820]   It shows up in borderline personality.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.700]   It shows up in PTSD.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:53.580]   What it is is a separation of the sense of self
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.920]   from the body.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.980]   And so you can have someone who,
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:58.500]   it's not as if you're numb, you're not anesthetized.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.820]   You can still, you know that something's happening
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.260]   to the body, but you just don't care
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.980]   because you don't ascribe it to yourself,
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.740]   which is very interesting, right?
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.100]   That is, how interesting is that?
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.420]   - The self-report narrative.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:11.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.560]   - Almost in your book, you touch on this,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.560]   and I will say is the most precise and meaningful
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.740]   and eloquent description of what might be consciousness,
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.300]   this narrative toward the self or of the self
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:26.380]   and where it might reside.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:29.460]   So in dissociative conditions,
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.760]   people are feeling as kind of an absence of a merge
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.040]   between mind and body.
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:35.420]   Is that one way to describe it?
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:37.520]   And as I recall, this paper involved
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.300]   an exploration of ketamine.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:40.340]   - Ketamine was a big part of it.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:41.180]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.000]   And so ketamine is another one of those cases
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.660]   where people can experience dissociation.
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.880]   Ketamine or PCP, we call these the dissociative drugs.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.840]   They cause it just like these other psychiatric conditions
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.180]   can cause it.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:59.180]   And so we were able to manifest this in mice,
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:02.100]   administering these dissociative agents in mice.
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.580]   We could make them still able to detect stimulus,
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:07.140]   but not care that it was happening.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:11.380]   All the while, we were recording the activity
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.740]   of individual cells in the brain to see what was going on,
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:18.080]   what was happening along with this dissociation,
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.540]   and then use optogenetics to see that it mattered
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:23.380]   to actually provide that pattern of activity
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:26.580]   and see, oh, that actually causes the dissociation.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.900]   So we could do all that in mice,
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.600]   which was just a, who would have thought
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.660]   that you could study something like this in mice.
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:38.340]   And we were able to go back and forth with human work
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:41.940]   because here in our Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center,
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:45.300]   there are a lot of what we call stereo EEG recording.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:46.760]   Patients who come in and in the course
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:50.420]   of normal clinical care, they have electrodes recording
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:53.420]   in their brain to identify where the seizure is
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:57.320]   so they can be candidates for removing a little patch
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.700]   of the brain that's causing the seizure.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.780]   This is done for patients who medications
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.560]   are not helping their seizure disorder.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:08.160]   And there was a patient who had a dissociative state
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.340]   before every seizure.
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.460]   So this was a human being who was really dissociating,
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.620]   who could tell us literally as it was happening.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.980]   And we could see this pattern,
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:18.300]   the same pattern that was happening in the mice
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:20.780]   in the same patch of the brain.
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.700]   We could see that happening in the human being
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:25.260]   at exactly the right time in the same patch of the brain
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:29.580]   that's homologous across these immense evolutionary distances.
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.960]   And we knew that it mattered too, both in mouse and human,
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.540]   because in the human, we could cause it to happen.
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:38.420]   - And I just want to underscore the power of not just that,
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:41.140]   I want to underscore the power of optogenetics
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:45.500]   and the ability to not just remove a particular experience
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.380]   or behavior by lesioning or destroying,
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.820]   but then to go back and actually activate the same structure
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:54.100]   or group of structures and see the emergence.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.620]   So it's essentially, these days you hear a lot
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:57.940]   about gain-of-function research
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.540]   in the context of viral manipulation,
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.140]   but gain-of-function is something that we do
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:04.580]   in the laboratory and you do in patients
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.740]   to both take away something and put it back,
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.140]   which gives you causality.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:11.060]   - That's right, yeah, and so, exactly.
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:14.140]   And so with optogenetics, we were able to provide
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:18.100]   in animals without being on any ketamine or any drug,
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.620]   and we could cause the dissociative state
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.060]   by playing in a precise pattern of activity.
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.680]   And that, who would have thought you could do that?
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:26.300]   There was a combined mouse and human paper.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:30.740]   Likewise, we've been able to play in, you know,
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:34.860]   visual sensations into the brains of mice.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:39.360]   And by observing which cells in the visual part
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.860]   of the brain, visual cortex, are naturally responsive
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:46.020]   to, for example, vertical bars instead of horizontal bars
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:48.620]   in the visual world, we could see which cells
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.200]   were normally reporting on vertical bars,
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:54.780]   and then we could use optogenetics to come and play in
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.420]   activity just to those cells.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:58.140]   - So these animals are not viewing anything?
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.340]   - Not viewing anything at all.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:02.500]   And we could activate just the vertical bar cells,
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.980]   and not only did the animal act as if it was seeing
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.940]   a vertical bar behaviorally, it was trained
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.860]   to do a particular thing if it saw a vertical bar,
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:12.660]   and it did that just as if it was seeing something visually.
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:14.740]   But everything in the brain that we were recording to,
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:18.560]   the internal representation of this external world
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.820]   was naturalistic, too.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:23.120]   It looked like the brain was seeing something visual.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.200]   So that's gain of function, too, you know,
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.160]   playing in, providing a complex sensation or percept
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.480]   that wasn't there before.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.480]   And we can do that, you know, across species.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.120]   So we haven't, you know, and of course, mice are social,
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.780]   and they do amazing acts of information processing,
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:46.780]   and so I try not to disparage our cousins too much.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:48.600]   - They certainly have helped the field of neuroscience
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.040]   - And medicine, I should mention.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.860]   And I know that people have various sensitivities
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.140]   about animal research, but the work that's been carried out
[01:45:55.140 --> 01:46:00.140]   in mice has been absolutely vital and instructional
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.700]   for treatment of human disease.
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:08.920]   Since we talked about dissociation and dissociative states,
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.540]   rather, and ketamine, I'd love your thoughts
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.900]   on psychedelic medicine.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:18.460]   You know, I sort of half joke, having grown up,
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.760]   in this area in Northern California,
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.360]   when it was much more counterculture than it is now,
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.100]   that many of the things that we're hearing about now,
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:30.520]   at least from my read of the history books,
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.680]   happened before.
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.440]   There was a movement aimed at taking
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.780]   the very same compounds, essentially,
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:37.860]   putting them into patients,
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:41.100]   or people were obviously using them recreationally,
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:42.720]   but putting them into patients
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.900]   and seeing tremendous positive effects,
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.900]   but also tremendous examples of induced psychiatric illness.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:52.420]   In other words, many people lost their minds
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.740]   as a consequence of overuse of psychedelics.
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:57.740]   I'll probably lose a few people out there,
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:01.780]   but I do want to talk about
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:04.300]   what is the state of these compounds?
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:06.420]   And I realize it's a huge category of compounds,
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:08.500]   but LSD and psilocybin, as I understand,
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:11.420]   trigger activation of particular serotonin receptor
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:13.340]   mechanisms may or may not lead
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:16.340]   to more widespread activation of the brain
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.300]   that one wouldn't see otherwise.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.620]   But when you look at the clinical
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.260]   and experimental literature,
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:23.860]   what is your sort of top contour sense
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.140]   of how effective these tools are going to be
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.700]   for treating depression?
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.100]   And then if we have the time,
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.620]   we could talk about trauma and MDMA and some of that work.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:36.140]   - Well, you're right to highlight both the opportunity
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.740]   and the peril that is there.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.780]   And of course, we want to help patients,
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:45.260]   and of course, we want to explore anything
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.340]   that might be helpful,
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:50.420]   but we want to do it in a safe and rigorous way.
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:53.540]   But I do think we should explore these avenues.
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:57.120]   These are agents that alter reality
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.180]   and alter the experience of reality, I should say,
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.420]   in relatively precise ways.
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:05.140]   They do have problems, they can be addictive,
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.600]   they can cause lasting change that is not desirable.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.340]   But we have to see these as opportunities.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.500]   We have to, first of all, study in the laboratory,
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:17.940]   and I'm doing this here.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:20.980]   We have big, we have safes
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:23.000]   with many interesting psychedelics
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.780]   that are all very carefully regulated.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:27.180]   We get inspections from the DEA and so on.
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.540]   - If anyone's hoping to find these labs,
[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:29.780]   they exist in outer space,
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:34.220]   so you need to be on board one of the SpaceX missions
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:36.140]   in order to access them, so don't try and come find them.
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:38.480]   - No, that's exactly true, yes.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.280]   And we're doing exactly this.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.780]   We're saying this is an incredible opportunity.
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:48.320]   If we could understand how the perception of reality
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.040]   is altered, we could create new kinds of intervention
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.580]   that don't have the risks and the problems
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:00.180]   of causing lasting change or addiction.
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:05.180]   Now, that said, even as these medications exist now,
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:09.220]   as you know, there's an impulse to use them
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.700]   in very small doses and to use them as adjunctive treatments
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:15.120]   for the therapy of various kinds.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.800]   And I'm also supportive of that
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.940]   if done carefully and rigorously.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:20.820]   Of course, there's risk,
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.900]   but there is risk with many other kinds of treatment,
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:28.900]   and I'm not sure that the risks for these medications
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:31.380]   vastly outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.820]   in other branches of medicine.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.380]   - Why would they work?
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.380]   I mean, let's say that indeed their main effect
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:44.700]   is to create more connectivity,
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:48.220]   at least in the moment, between brain areas.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.820]   So the way I think about a very,
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.820]   I think about the two extremes of my experience anyways,
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:57.320]   a high degree of stress and focus, for whatever reason,
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:59.780]   is going to create changes in my visual field
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:02.160]   and changes in the way that I perceive time
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.900]   so that I'm going to micro-slice time,
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:07.300]   I'm in a very contracted view of whatever my experience is.
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.440]   Whereas on the opposite extreme,
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.420]   in a dream or in sleep, space and time are very fluid,
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.180]   and I'm essentially relaxed,
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.980]   although it might be a very interesting dream,
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:18.580]   it might not be.
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.680]   Psychedelics seem to be a trajectory,
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.340]   I'm not too far off from the dream state
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:29.900]   where space and time are essentially not as rigid.
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:32.140]   And there is this element of synesthesia,
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.620]   of blending of the senses, you know,
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:39.620]   feeling colors and hearing light and things of that sort.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.380]   You hear these reports anyway.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:46.540]   Why would having that dreamlike experience
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:51.580]   somehow relieve depression long-term?
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.980]   Do we have any idea why that might be?
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:59.580]   - We have some ideas and no deep understanding.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:02.100]   One way I think about the psychedelics
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:07.100]   is they increase the willingness of our brain
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:13.340]   to accept unlikely ways of constructing the world,
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:16.420]   unlikely hypotheses, as it were, as to what's going on.
[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:18.260]   The brain, in particular our cortex,
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:21.820]   I think is a hypothesis generation and testing machine.
[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:23.840]   It's coming up with models about everything.
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:26.900]   It's got a lot of bits of data coming in
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:29.420]   and it's making models and updating the models
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:32.620]   and changing them theories, hypotheses for what's going on.
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:36.020]   And some of those never reach our conscious mind.
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:38.340]   And this is something I talk about in projections
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:42.300]   in the book quite a bit is many of these are filtered out
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:44.500]   before they get to our conscious mind.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.340]   And that's good.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:47.420]   We think how distracted we'd be
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:49.860]   if we were constantly having to evaluate all these,
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:51.540]   you know, hypotheses about, you know,
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:54.820]   what kinds of shapes or objects or processes were out there.
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:56.420]   And so a lot of this is handled
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:59.020]   before it gets to consciousness.
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.780]   What the psychedelics seem to do
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:05.780]   is they change the threshold for us to become aware
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:09.540]   of these incomplete hypotheses or wrong hypotheses
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:14.140]   or concepts that might be noise, but are just wrong
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.060]   and so are never allowed to get into our conscious mind.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:20.900]   Now, you know, that's pretty interesting
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:23.260]   and it goes wrong in psychiatric disorders.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:25.660]   I think in schizophrenia,
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:29.380]   sometimes the paranoid delusions that people have
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:33.260]   are examples of these poor models
[01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:35.100]   that escape into the conscious mind
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.380]   and become accepted as reality
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:40.340]   and they never should have gotten out there.
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:43.180]   Now, how could something like this in the right way
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.340]   help with something like depression?
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:49.940]   Patients with depression often are stuck.
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:54.940]   They can't look into the fact
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:59.740]   to the future world of possibilities as effectively.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:04.060]   Everything seems hopeless.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.220]   And what does that really mean?
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.340]   They discount the value of their own action.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:10.780]   They discount the value of the world
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:13.300]   at giving rise to a future that matters.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.820]   Everything seems to run out
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:18.300]   like a river just running out into a desert and drying up.
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:22.380]   And what these agents may do
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:25.460]   that increase the flow through circuitry, if you will,
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:27.420]   the percolation of activity through circuitry
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.300]   may end up doing for depression
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.300]   is increasing the escape of some tendrils of process,
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.900]   of forward progression through the world.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:41.660]   That's a concept, that's how I think about it.
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:43.420]   There are ways we can make that rigorous.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:47.060]   We can indeed identify in the brain by recording.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:50.780]   We can see cells that represent steps along a path
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:54.160]   and look into the future.
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.540]   And we can rigorously define these cells
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:59.260]   and we can see if these are altered on psychedelics.
[01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:00.500]   And so that's one of the reasons
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:04.020]   that we're working with these agents in the laboratory
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.860]   to say, is this really the case?
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:08.820]   Are these opening up new paths
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.920]   or representations of paths into the future?
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:17.420]   - MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:21.940]   in that it leads to big increases in brain levels
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.660]   of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:26.740]   And I realized that the neuromodulators
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:29.340]   like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert,
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.580]   not alone, the way they're commonly described
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:35.420]   in the more general popular discussions.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:38.880]   However, it is a unique compound
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:41.060]   and it's different than the serotonergic compounds
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:43.420]   like LSD and psilocybin.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:48.100]   And there are now data still emerging
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:52.600]   that it might be, and in some cases can be useful
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.460]   for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.260]   Why would that work?
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:01.920]   And a larger question,
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.060]   perhaps the more important question is,
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:08.460]   psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds,
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:10.100]   in my mind, there are two components.
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.780]   There's the experience you have while you're on them.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:15.220]   And then there's the effect they have after.
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:18.900]   People are generating variations of these compounds
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:21.980]   that are non-hallucinatory variations.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:25.940]   But how crucial do you think it is to have,
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:30.820]   let's stay with MDMA, the experience of huge levels
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:33.460]   of dopamine, huge levels of serotonin,
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.780]   atypical levels of dopamine and serotonin released,
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:38.020]   having this highly abnormal experience
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:39.620]   in order to be normal again.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:40.840]   - Yeah.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.020]   I think the brain learns from those experiences.
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.460]   That's the way I see it.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:48.440]   And so, for example, people who've taken MDMA,
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.680]   they will, as you say, they'll be the acute phase
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.820]   of being on the drug and experiencing
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:59.420]   this extreme connectedness with other people, for example.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:02.980]   And then the drug wears off,
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:06.120]   but the brain learned from that experience.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.160]   And so what people will report is,
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:12.660]   yeah, I'm not in that state, but I saw what was possible.
[01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:17.460]   I saw, yeah, there don't need to be barriers,
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.740]   or at least not as many barriers as I thought.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:23.980]   I can connect with more people in a way that is helpful.
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:26.380]   And so I think it's the learning
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.500]   that happens in that state that actually matters.
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:30.820]   - And as you described that,
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:32.500]   that sounds a lot like what I understand
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:35.260]   to be the hallmark feature of really good psychoanalysis,
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:38.620]   that the relationship between patient and therapist,
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:43.140]   hopefully evolves to the point where these kinds of tests
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:45.820]   can be run within the context of that relationship
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:47.840]   and then exported to other relationships.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.220]   Is that- - Exactly right, yeah.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.280]   - And that probably, I'm assuming,
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.840]   is still the goal of really good psychiatry also.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.700]   - It's a part of- - Intimacy, really.
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:59.820]   - It should be, when we have time,
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:02.320]   I think all good psychiatrists try to achieve
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:05.600]   that level of connection and learning,
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:10.600]   try to help patients create a new model that is stable,
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:12.120]   that is learned,
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:16.160]   and that can help instruct future behavior.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.600]   - One of the things that I took from reading your book,
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.120]   in addition to learning so much science
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:24.520]   and the future of psychiatry and brain science,
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.000]   was amidst these, in many cases,
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.500]   very tragic cases and sadness,
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.200]   and a lot of the weight that that puts on the clinician,
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.200]   on you also, that there's a central chord of optimism,
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:45.840]   that where we're headed is not just possible,
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.880]   but very likely and better.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:53.280]   And, you know, are you an optimist?
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:54.880]   - I am, and this is, by the way,
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.560]   this was a really interesting experience
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:00.840]   in writing projections because I had a dual goal.
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.720]   I wanted it to be for everybody,
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:07.720]   literally everybody in the world who wants to read it.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:09.900]   And yet at the same time,
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:14.900]   I wanted to stay absolutely rigorously close to the science,
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:20.720]   what was actually known when I was speaking about science,
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:24.240]   when I was speaking about the neurobiology of the brain
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.280]   or psychiatry,
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:30.280]   I wanted to not have any of my scientific colleagues think,
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:33.040]   oh, he's going too far, he's saying too much.
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:34.920]   And so I had these two goals,
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:37.060]   which I kept in my mind the entire time,
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:39.680]   and a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:42.040]   we talked about was on this path
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.120]   of staying excruciatingly rigorous in the science,
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.460]   and yet letting people see the hope,
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:51.040]   where things were, have everybody see
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.180]   that we've come a long way, we have a long way to go,
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:58.360]   but the trajectory and the path is beautiful.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.120]   And so that was the goal.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.120]   I think, of course, that sounds almost impossible
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:10.600]   to jointly satisfy those two goals,
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.920]   but I kept that in my mind the whole way through.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.520]   And yes, I am optimistic,
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:16.320]   and I hope that came through in the book.
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.320]   - But it certainly did,
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:18.920]   and at least from this colleague,
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:22.680]   you did achieve both.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:26.480]   And it's a wonderful, it's a masterful book, really,
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.320]   and one that as a scientist and somebody
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.320]   who is a fellow brain explorer hits all the marks of rigor
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.480]   and is incredibly interesting,
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.840]   and there's a ton of storytelling.
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.280]   I don't want to give away too much about it,
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.600]   but people should definitely check out the book.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:45.760]   Are you active on social media if people want to follow you
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.640]   and connect with what you're doing now and going forward?
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.120]   - Yeah, I have a Twitter.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:54.200]   That's where I mainly do exchange,
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:56.320]   tell people about things that are happening.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.200]   We'll provide a link to it,
[01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:59.280]   but that's Karl Deisseroth, as I recall, with a K.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.520]   - That's right. - Yeah.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:04.440]   And so you're on Twitter, and people will hear this.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.600]   Definitely check out the book.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:09.080]   There are other people in our community
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:13.200]   that of course are going to be reaching out on your behalf,
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.880]   but it's incredible that you juggle
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:17.800]   this enormous number of things.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:22.080]   Perhaps even more important, however,
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.800]   is that it's all in service to this larger thing
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:25.860]   of relieving suffering.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:28.320]   So thank you so much for your time today,
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:30.560]   for the book and the work that went into the book.
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:31.780]   I can't even imagine.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.880]   For the laboratory work and the development channel ops
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.880]   and clarity and all the related technologies
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:37.720]   and for the clinical work you're doing
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:39.080]   and for sharing with us.
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.640]   - Well, thank you for all you're doing and reaching out.
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:43.720]   I'm very impressed by it.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:46.240]   It's important, and it's so valuable.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.400]   And thank you for taking the time
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:49.760]   and for all your gracious words about the book.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:51.320]   Thank you.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.880]   - I hope you enjoyed today's discussion
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.060]   with Dr. Deisseroth as much as I did.
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.240]   Be sure to check out his new book "Projections,
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.800]   A Story of Human Emotions."
