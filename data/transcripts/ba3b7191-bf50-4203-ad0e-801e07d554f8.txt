[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.340]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.720]   in the right direction.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.100]   In this episode, I wanted to discuss Voddiebockum's latest book, which dropped on April 6th of
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.940]   2021.
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.180]   That book is called Fault Lines, The Social Justice Movement, and Evangelicalism's Looming
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.100]   Catastrophe, which is an 11-chapter book.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.060]   In the book, Voddie is wading into some controversial territory because he gives his perspective
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.460]   unabashedly on what the social justice movement is doing within what was previously accepted
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.140]   as conservative evangelical circles.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.320]   He does also name names, but he does so reluctantly and charitably.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.220]   And he's doing that because he doesn't want anybody to be dancing around who is being
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.360]   spoken of and what is being said and he wants to bring clarity to the subject.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.960]   He doesn't do it for the sake of publicly shaming anyone.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.220]   At the same time, when you are a public figure and you make far-reaching statements, it is
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.200]   fair if your statements are examined under the lens of scripture and plain reason to
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700]   see if they pass the test of scrutiny.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.420]   And he does this that in hopes he might win over his brothers and sisters.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.660]   So before I begin this episode, let me tell you right now that there are going to be a
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.740]   lot of quotes from the book.
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.460]   I'm doing that so that I can give you a huge sampling of what exactly this book is about.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.340]   But let me say that this book, at least in my opinion, does seem to go pretty hand in
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.740]   hand with another book I previously mentioned.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.500]   And that was another book I was also on the launch team for.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.140]   That book was called Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth by Thaddeus Williams.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.520]   Now in that book, Professor Thaddeus Williams, he doesn't go so far as to name names, which
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.820]   is why I think that this book is a nice compliment to Confronting Injustice Without Compromising
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.820]   Truth.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.460]   And although there is some overlap, the overlap is a lot more minimal than I thought it would
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.740]   be.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.060]   In episode 10, which I recorded a while back, hasn't been published yet, but I use the same
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.620]   format as I'll do in this episode.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.880]   So with that said, let me begin this episode by quoting to you a portion from the introduction
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.840]   of Vodi's book.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:18.560]   Vodi writes, "Why are people and groups like Thabiti Anwabili, Tim Keller, Russell Moore,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.160]   the Southern Baptist Convention, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Nine Marks,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   the Gospel Coalition, and Together for the Gospel, T4G, being identified with critical
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.080]   social justice on one side of the fault, and people like John MacArthur, Tom Askell, Owen
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.880]   Strayen, Douglas Wilson, and the late R. C. Sproul being identified on the other?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.080]   There are groups and ministries that have embraced CRT, and those are problematic.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.840]   But there is a larger group that is sympathetic to it because of their desire to fight what
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.600]   they see as a problem of racial injustice.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.980]   Most of the groups I will mention in this book fall into the latter category.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.400]   It is not a stretch to say we are seeing seismic shifts in the evangelical landscape.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.100]   But is it an exaggeration to call this a coming catastrophe?
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.400]   I don't think so.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.880]   John MacArthur calls it the greatest threat to the gospel in his lifetime, and he had
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.160]   a front row seat to the debates over both inerrancy and lordship salvation.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.720]   What do I, MacArthur, and myriad other pastors and leaders see on the horizon that leads
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.160]   to such drastic statements?
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.360]   Before he gets into the main substance of the book, he gives a sort of mini autobiography.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.040]   That starts with chapter 1.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:48.480]   In chapter 1, entitled "A Black Man," he writes this, "I was born on the San Andreas
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   Fault.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.460]   More specifically, I was born in Los Angeles, California on March 11, 1969.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.760]   This was the end of the Great Migration between 1915 and 1970 that saw somewhere between 5
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.820]   and 10 million blacks leave the South in search of a better life.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.620]   This migration took place along very specific routes to the North and West and landed large
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.060]   swaths of the black population in cities like New York, Boston, Detroit, Oakland, Los Angeles,
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.020]   and other major urban areas."
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.140]   In chapter 2, he continues to make a case for his mini-autobiography by speaking about
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.500]   his life as a black Christian, and that chapter is aptly entitled "A Black Christian."
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.540]   Vouille writes, "There is a major debate among black evangelicals as to whether, in
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.580]   discussing and applying our faith in the midst of the current cultural crisis, the priority
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.260]   should be on our blackness or our Christianity.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.900]   In other words, are we Christians or black people first?
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.060]   This may seem strange to non-black Christians; however, I assure you, it is a real issue
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.660]   and is relevant to the topic of this book.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.020]   I have wrestled with this question since coming to faith, and I have fallen on both sides
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   of it at different times, all of which I will detail in this chapter.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.900]   The question of the proper order of faith and ethnicity is critical to understanding
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.780]   the various positions people take in the broader social justice debate, one with which all
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.260]   people must wrestle, regardless of their ethnicity; however, for black Christians, this concept
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.080]   has often been difficult to embrace for several reasons."
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.580]   He goes on to explain these reasons, one of which include the fact that black nationalists
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.300]   have often argued that Christianity is the "white man's religion" and used it to
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.980]   encourage slaves to be docile.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.940]   He'll spend the next portion of the chapter talking about his conversion experience, which
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:59.020]   came in October of 1987 on the campus of New Mexico State University, where he was the
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.020]   starting tight-end.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.420]   A guy named Steve Morgan, who was involved in a campus ministry, reached out to him and
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.580]   they began talking about the Bible, which eventually led to Vody repenting and believing
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.780]   in the gospel message.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.040]   That was his first year in college.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.980]   In his third year, he would go back to California because his cousin Jamal was murdered, which
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.860]   caused him to think deeply about how differently their paths diverged.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.780]   Vody then goes on to talk about how early on in his faith, he approached Christianity
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.460]   with an extremely Afrocentric approach.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.500]   Vody writes, "It also reminded me how Afrocentric I was at that time.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.020]   There I stood, an HBU ministry student who would go on to win the prestigious Riverside
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.620]   Scholarship (a full scholarship to the Southern Baptist Seminary of my choice) for being an
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.140]   outstanding theology student, and I was wearing a t-shirt featuring MLK Jr., Malcolm X, and
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.580]   Elijah Muhammad.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.780]   I assure you, it doesn't get more Afrocentric than that.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.220]   Nor did my Afrocentrism stop at wearing t-shirts.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.620]   Not only was I a member of Omega Psi Phi, a black fraternity known for having its members
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:19.220]   brand a Greek letter on their arms, but I also helped get it back onto the NMSU New
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.900]   Mexico State University campus after it had been suspended.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.140]   I had married a woman from a historically black college, and was one of the founders
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.140]   of the Black Student Fellowship at HBU.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.740]   At that point in my life, I was most certainly more black than Christian."
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.660]   He goes on to talk about how his star began to rise within the SPC, but as he began to
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.380]   take unpopular positions, he also experienced pushback.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.940]   He began to see what the social justice ideology was doing way back before the events of this
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.480]   past year, and he saw how detrimental it could and would be for evangelicalism.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.300]   Because of that, for Voti, being silent was not an option.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:11.340]   I want to stop here really quickly because already in chapters 1 and 2, you have Voti
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.220]   laying the foundation for why he writes the book and why he has the credentials to talk
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:25.100]   about how when you place ethnicity over your identity in Christ, how that becomes extremely
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.600]   problematic and eventually leads to a completely different gospel.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.060]   It is not neutral.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.020]   It's not benign, and it's not neutral in nature.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.780]   It is placing ethnicity over your identity in Christ is completely malignant to your
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.540]   faith and to the gospel message.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:53.140]   We see something happening with Asians right now, something almost parallel.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:10:03.540]   And so I think for that reason, this book has at least become, to me, an important book
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   to read.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.660]   I'm not saying it's like some kind of emergency and everyone needs to stop and read this book,
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:20.060]   but there is much to be gleaned on a personal level if you begin to buy into this whole
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:30.340]   narrative of what I see as causing Asians to become disgruntled and just kind of have
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:37.940]   their eyes taken off the gospel message and then ultimately led to a completely different
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.620]   direction than what is the actual gospel.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.620]   But on with the book.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:50.000]   In chapter 3, entitled Seeking True Justice, he talks about false social justice narratives
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.980]   and doesn't shy away from naming key figures such as Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.660]   He goes on to talk about what the actual cost of these false narratives are and provides
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:07.100]   actual academic research to back up his claims, including diving deep into statistics regarding
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.340]   policing in the US.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:14.180]   He talks about George Floyd, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile, Michael Brown, and Breonna Taylor
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.500]   while dealing with objections.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.580]   In chapter 4, entitled A New Religion, he talks about the religious nature of CRT, aka
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.700]   anti-racism, aka the ideology behind the social justice movement.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:35.260]   In chapter 4, Voti writes, "The anti-racist movement has many of the hallmarks of a cult,
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.700]   including staying close enough to the Bible to avoid immediate detection and hiding the
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.540]   fact that it has a new theology and a new glossary of terms that diverge ever so slightly
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.740]   from Christian orthodoxy, at least at first.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:55.220]   In classic cult fashion, they borrow from the familiar and accept it, then infuse it
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.700]   with new meaning.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.600]   This allows the cult to appeal to the faithful within the dominant orthodox religions from
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.900]   which it draws its converts.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.880]   This new cult has created a new lexicon that has served as a scaffolding to support what
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.940]   has become an entire body of divinity.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:18.860]   In the same manner, this new body of divinity comes complete with its own cosmology.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:28.360]   CRT has original sin racism, law is anti-racism, gospel is racial reconciliation, martyrs are
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:34.820]   Saints Trayvon, Mike, George, Breonna, etc., the priests are the oppressed minorities,
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:44.140]   the means of atonement, reparations, new birth is wokeness, liturgy is lament, the canon
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:53.380]   is the social justice science, the theologians are D'Angelo, Kendi, Brown, Crenshaw, McIntosh,
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.100]   etc., and the catechism would be "say their names."
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:03.380]   We'll examine some of these topics in this chapter and a few later on.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.940]   In chapter 5, entitled "A New Priesthood," he talks about ethnic Gnosticism which was
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.300]   a term he came up with to describe what's been going on in the culture.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.900]   In chapter 5 he writes this, "It would be more accurate, though, in light of the broader
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:25.780]   assumptions of the critical social justice movement to use the term "minority Gnosticism,"
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.020]   since the same argument is applied to all oppressed minorities.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.780]   In fact, it is their oppressed status that, according to CSJ, gives these groups their
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.200]   special knowledge.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.260]   This is a central tenet of critical race theory.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.380]   The voice of color thesis, writes Richard Delgado, holds that because of their different
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:51.740]   histories and experiences with oppression, black, American Indian, Asian, and Latino
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.700]   writers and thinkers may be able to communicate to their white counterparts matters that the
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.220]   whites are unlikely to know.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:07.420]   Thus, according to CRT, minority status brings with it a presumed competence to speak about
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.500]   race and racism.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.660]   This makes sense since critical race theory builds on the insights of two previous movements,
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.220]   critical legal studies and radical feminism, to both of which it owes a large debt.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:27.540]   Specifically, the debt CRT owes to radical feminism is the towering influence of standpoint
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:33.940]   epistemology, the hallmark of ethnic Gnosticism."
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:39.220]   He goes on to state how in ethnic Gnosticism, one of the planks is that the narrative trumps
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.780]   truth.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.700]   In chapter 6, entitled "A New Canon," he talks about how very subtly the Bible's
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:52.100]   sufficiency is being pepped away at, and giving a case study, Voughty writes this, "At
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.220]   the 2018 Together for the Gospel conference, David Platt, then head of the Southern Baptist
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:04.140]   Convention's International Mission Board, delivered a message from Amos 5, then repented
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:09.180]   in tears for his white privilege, silence, and inaction.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:15.220]   Those inclined toward CSJ found it inspiring, but to others, Platt's message represented
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.500]   a fault line.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.340]   It was an exercise in eisegesis.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:25.620]   In other words, instead of being faithful to the text of Amos 5, he read foreign ideas
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.220]   into the text to make the Bible serve his agenda.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.220]   The most aggravating aspect of Platt's message, wrote one blogger, was his flagrant
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.540]   misuse of Amos 5.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.180]   One pastor summed it up well, "MLK said men should not be judged by the color of their
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:47.620]   skin, T4G said pastors should be judged by the color of their congregations."
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:53.260]   A Christianity Today writer tried to reduce the criticism to some kind of white fragility,
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.660]   but that was both inaccurate and disingenuous.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:01.220]   In fact, many of those who agreed with Platt's sentiment acknowledged that his sermon fell
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.500]   short of exegetical standards.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.620]   At least two high-level evangelical leaders, one closely associated with the conference,
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.860]   said as much to me personally.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.940]   Another of course will go on record.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.580]   Moreover, the message fell short of Platt's own standard.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.300]   He has a Ph.D. in preaching and served as a professor of preaching and apologetics at
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.460]   New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.300]   So if anybody knows better than to misuse scripture like that, it is David Platt.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:35.420]   The obvious question then is why someone of his caliber would preach a sermon that led
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.020]   one preaching professor to tell me privately, "If he had done that in my class, I would
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.660]   have given him a D."
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.260]   The answer is simple.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.180]   David Platt loves Jesus, loves people, and is passionate about reconciliation.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.100]   I know this because I know and love David Platt.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:56.340]   I also know he started reading and being influenced by the "woke" canon.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:01.220]   Consequently, he began to reach beyond the Bible to find God's truth regarding race.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.180]   How did he get to that point?
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.820]   According to an article on the Gospel Coalition's website, Nine Marks founder Mark Devers suggested
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:15.300]   Platt read Divided by Faith, Evangelical Religion, and the Problem of Race in America by Michael
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:21.660]   Emerson and Christian Smith, a book Devers has publicly praised saying, "This won't
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.060]   be the most exciting book you read this year, but it may have the most exciting results
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.060]   in your life."
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.740]   Platt's message was dripping with the book's influence, especially his emphasis on the
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.940]   concept of America's being racialized, which is the book's main theme.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:43.620]   Ironically, the book does not make Christianity Today's list, however, it is arguably the
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.620]   most frequently referenced and recommended race resource among Evangelicalism's Big
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:57.620]   Three, also known as the Gospel Coalition, Nine Marks, and Together for the Gospel."
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:20.020]   "I am a debater, I always have been.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.100]   But in the current climate, debate is becoming a lost art, partly because of a general decline
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.180]   in the study of logic and rhetoric, but mostly because of the general feminization of culture
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.260]   and its consequent disdain for open, verbal combat.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:40.500]   Gone are the days of Luther and Erasmus slugging it out over the question of original sin.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.260]   Today, both men would be accused of being petty, for daring to split hairs over such
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.620]   theological minutia; mean-spirited, for daring to speak so forcefully in favor of their own
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.500]   position and against the others; and downright un-Christ-like, for throwing around the word
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.500]   heresy.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.540]   I have often said, 'The eleventh commandment is, 'Thou shalt be nice.'
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.260]   And we don't believe the other ten.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.420]   One of the negative results of this is no longer being able to deal with ideas without
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.660]   attacking the people who hold them.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.940]   Disagreements quickly deteriorate into arguments and worse.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.580]   Consequently, taking a position on an issue carries the automatic assumption that one
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.820]   is utterly opposed to not only the opposing view, but to all who hold it.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.780]   Therefore, we don't debate ideas at all, but go straight for personal attacks and character
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.380]   assassination.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.640]   And this debate is no different.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.340]   To the anti-critical social justice camp, those on the side of CSJ are all cultural
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.340]   Marxists.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.420]   Conversely, to the social justice camp, those who oppose their cause are all racists.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.500]   Even fellow black people like me, who according to their definition of racism, can't be
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   racist.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.860]   But I digress.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.340]   The result is a standstill, a demilitarized zone that exists, not because hostilities
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:02.220]   have ceased, but because we all tacitly believe there is no solution."
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:10.060]   In the same chapter, Votie writes about the Dallas Statement, which was a joint statement
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.100]   by John MacArthur, Votie Bauckham, Daryl Harrison, and many others.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.620]   It's also known as the Statement on Social Justice.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:26.340]   Votie writes this, "Documents like the Dallas Statement are never meant to be a final
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.540]   word.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.460]   The Bible is the final word.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.380]   Nor did we believe our statement would be beyond reproach.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.300]   Tom Askell, the principal architect of the first draft of the Dallas Statement, captured
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.700]   the sentiment perfectly when he wrote, "The statement makes no claim of any ecclesiastical
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.700]   authority.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.580]   It is issued for the purpose of calling attention to and clarifying concerns.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.580]   We have spoken on these issues with no disrespect or loss of love for our brothers and sisters
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.900]   who disagree with what we have written.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.980]   Rather, our hope is that this statement might actually provoke the kind of brotherly dialogue
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:04.980]   that can promote unity in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we all love and trust."
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.100]   But that is not what happened.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.760]   In fact, there has been very little formal pushback or dialogue.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.780]   Most of our friends at NYMARCS, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the Gospel
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.340]   Coalition, Together for the Gospel, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Presbyterian Church
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.440]   of America, all of whom had historically embraced us as ministry partners and been willing to
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.500]   critique us as brothers, didn't write a single word one way or the other.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.360]   Tim Geller did offer a comment.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.040]   When asked about the Dallas Statement, his response said more about its philosophical
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.460]   presuppositions than it did about the document.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:43.860]   The statement can't be judged based upon whether or not the words are right, he said,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.580]   but by the consequences those words might eventually bring out.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.580]   By contrast, when John MacArthur, the lightning rider with whom most people associate the
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.860]   Dallas Statement, decided to hold services at his church in Southern California last
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.840]   summer in defiance of Governor Gavin Newsom's order to keep churches from meeting during
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.980]   the coronavirus pandemic, NYMARCS fired off a missive addressing MacArthur's decision
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.660]   from a biblical, theological, and historical perspective.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.780]   But the Dallas Statement didn't warrant a drop of ink.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.920]   Did these groups fail to address the statement because it was correct?
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.580]   If so, why didn't they join us in signing it?
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.500]   Was it because, as more than one of the leaders of the aforementioned ministry stated, the
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:32.880]   group lacked any names with gravitas, therefore implying the statement was insignificant?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.980]   If MacArthur, who called the meeting, lacks gravitas, then there's no need to warn people
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.820]   to be cautious about following his lead.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:46.420]   No, there was a much bigger issue at play, a fault line that everybody knew was there
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:52.060]   and that nobody wanted to acknowledge."
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.560]   Vody then goes on to talk about Resolution 9, which was when the SPC adopted CRT as an
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.380]   analytical tool, which occurred under the leadership of JD Greer.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:08.820]   In chapter 8, entitled "The Damage," Vody goes on to talk about the devastation this
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.140]   worldview or rival religion has caused.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:18.700]   Vody states in summary that what ends up happening is real problems end up not getting addressed
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.140]   because they do not line up with the false narrative.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.820]   In chapter 9, entitled "Aftershock," he further goes on to give examples of how this
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.420]   worldview has drastically changed the tone of some of the celebrity pastors.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.840]   He deals at length with statements from Tim Keller, David Platt, Mark Dever, and Jonathan
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:42.100]   Lehman within the context of abortion and so-called one-issue voting.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:48.900]   In chapter 10, entitled "Restoration and Mitigation," Vody encourages the reader to contend Christianly.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:55.420]   He writes, "Many modern Christians are uncomfortable with war language.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:00.420]   Perhaps it is because of the aforementioned Eleventh Commandment, 'Thou shalt be nice.'
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:06.540]   As a result, anything that looks or sounds remotely aggressive, confrontational, or masculine
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.200]   is deemed less than Christian.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.500]   But the Bible is replete with war language, and actual war.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.780]   And that language is appropriate here because we are at war.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.780]   But we must not rely on ordinary tactics.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.960]   For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.540]   For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but have divine power to destroy
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.540]   strongholds.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.860]   To destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.260]   And take every thought captive to obey Christ, being ready to punish every disobedience when
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.820]   your obedience is complete.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.500]   As we wage this war, the Apostle's words will be our guide, and the kingdom of God, His
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.980]   rule and reign in our lives, and our world, will be our goal.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.220]   But first, we must understand why we are at war.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.980]   Spoiler alert, we didn't start it."
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:03.540]   The scripture reference that Vody quoted was 2 Corinthians 10, 3-6.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.940]   So for those of you who are maybe starting to get nervous at this point, he makes it
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:15.220]   a point to show the reader that our war is spiritual, and our weapons are also spiritual,
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.940]   and we fight for the truth of the gospel and biblical justice.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.720]   While not making light of the fact that we must destroy arguments and speculations, taking
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.260]   every thought captive, and confront lies while holding on to the truth.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.180]   We must listen with discernment, but we must also correct.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:40.900]   In the closing chapter entitled "Solid Ground," Vody states this, "I hope this book helps
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.020]   better equip you to be a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.020]   of truth.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.540]   I also hope to embolden you to pull back the curtain and expose the wizard.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:56.940]   Call out the boy who cried wolf, proclaim that the emperor has no clothes, and any other
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.600]   metaphor you can think of for shedding light on these fault lines.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.620]   Not so you can defeat your brethren in an argument, but so you can engage them with
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.380]   the hopes of winning them.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.140]   Love your brothers and sisters enough to contend with them and for them."
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.560]   Well that does it for my preview or review of the book.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.780]   And my goal here wasn't to just give you a summary of the book, but a huge sampling,
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.820]   which is why I felt giving you these lengthy quotes was the way to go.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:31.220]   But before I sign off, I want to share just a little bit of my heart here.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:36.340]   The reason I'm concerned about this movement is because it is taking well-meaning Christians
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.600]   on a road that is completely antithetical to the gospel.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.060]   And I completely understand that it is difficult because we have friends, all of us do, from
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:51.780]   all different areas, or according to Vodi, differing sides of the fault line.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:57.420]   But if you believe this ideology is as sinful as Vodi claims, then going along with this
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.100]   pseudo-gospel is not helping anyone at all.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:07.260]   Moreover, I am personally convinced that this ideology is a wolf in sheep's clothing and
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:14.580]   the vast majority of celebrity pastors flatly do not care enough to speak out about it particularly
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:20.980]   based on Vodi's credible claims that many did not want to go on record condemning much
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:26.380]   of the CRT language coming out from big evangelicalism.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:35.380]   Like Vodi, I agree, being silent is not an option.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:41.020]   Thanks for making it to the end, I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.820]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
