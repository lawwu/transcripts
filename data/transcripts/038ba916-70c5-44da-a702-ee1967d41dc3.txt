[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.860]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.980]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.840]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.860]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.760]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.880]   in the right direction.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.840]   For episode 11, I want to spend some time talking about the most difficult time I've
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.440]   ever faced in my life so far and how it relates to the conception of life.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.740]   Many who are listening already know exactly what this episode is going to be about.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.460]   As I stated in the introductory episode to this podcast, now and then I want to be vulnerable
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.620]   with the listener to bring a sense of humanity into the conversation.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.060]   Knowledge is powerful, in particular when it is personal.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.140]   I'm hoping my vulnerability disarms you and allows us to see each other as fellow humans,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.120]   fellow image bearers as is every single human being that has ever walked this planet.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.700]   As I'm recording this, I'm 39 and I'll be turning 40 shortly.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.460]   Not an old man, but not a young man either.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.460]   The most difficult period in my life by far, overwhelmingly, was when my wife Diane had
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.220]   her ectopic pregnancy.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.860]   In December of 2019, Diane had been complaining about stomach pain for a bit of time.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.900]   It started off as slight stomach pains never went away and the pain only increased over
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.600]   several days to the point of unbearability.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.800]   Not wanting to miss work and me just going along with it, Diane finished work one weekday
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.360]   and we had pre-planned to go to the hospital afterwards.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.740]   I was in trial during this time and just to articulate an understatement, trials are extremely
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.520]   stressful.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.360]   And while you're engaged in one, they absorb your entire life.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.920]   In any case, we come home, we change, we go to the hospital and wait as Diane is called
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160]   to get evaluated.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.440]   She gets called in, goes in.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.380]   After some time, the nurse that had called Diane in comes out, looks at me, and calls
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.960]   me inside.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.040]   He proceeds to tell me that he's probably not supposed to be telling me this, but he
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.560]   couldn't help himself, he couldn't keep it to himself.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.140]   He looks at Diane and myself and states, "Congratulations."
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.440]   I fall to the floor in absolute disbelief and Diane is the one who's sort of like,
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.200]   "Get it together, man."
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.120]   We're escorted to a nearby patient room and I proceed to find out why Diane is nowhere
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.620]   near as thrilled and elated as I am.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.580]   Because of the pain she had been experiencing, she had a strong suspicion that her pregnancy
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.160]   might be ectopic.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.800]   She began to articulate similar stories from her group of friends who had gone through
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.540]   an ectopic pregnancy.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.700]   As I listen to Diane, I'm reasoning internally, thinking, "Well, if this is indeed an ectopic
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.600]   pregnancy, the nurse wouldn't have told us that she was pregnant, right?"
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.380]   You see, in context, implied that it was a viable pregnancy.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.860]   Ectopic pregnancies seem to be relatively common.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.580]   One would think that would be something you check for prior to informing a couple they
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.660]   are pregnant, right?
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.660]   Diane's concerns at the time seemed a little too pessimistically cautious.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.140]   At least to me.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.540]   I'm already on the whole "I know it's a boy" train, thinking about further plans
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.360]   to clean out our second bedroom, to get a baby ready.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.740]   The doctor comes in.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.860]   I make some lame joke about him being Korean since I'm Korean too, but I could tell from
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.980]   the moment he was walking in that he was apprehensive.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:51.340]   The optimism is slowly starting to leak out of my body, and he asks us what information
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.420]   we've received so far.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.900]   The tone and the manner in which he posed that question tipped me off, and I thought
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.700]   to myself that I don't want to get this nurse reprimanded or fired, so I didn't
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.860]   play it on too thick with the nurse.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.500]   I just conveyed to the doctor that we were told Diane was pregnant, but in the same breath,
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.300]   I also stated that she was concerned that it could be an ectopic pregnancy based on
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.260]   some of the symptoms that she had.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.980]   The doctor readily agreed, and in fact had already put in a request that we be received
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.900]   at a sister location to the hospital where we were at, where Diane could be examined
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.340]   since the hospital we were at wasn't equipped to do so.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:47.860]   We gather ourselves, and we begin to depart from that particular location.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.860]   As we're leaving, the nurse waves congrats, the same LVN who had told us we were pregnant
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.660]   with this huge smile, and looking back, I can't tell you if I was even able to muster
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.300]   up the fortitude to even crack a smile.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.220]   I just know that we left.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.900]   We get to the sister location, pretty defeated at this point.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.700]   Diane begins her examination.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:25.760]   Sure enough, Diane had not only undergone an ectopic pregnancy, but she had undergone
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.460]   massive internal bleeding.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.460]   Surgery not only needed to happen, it needed to happen now.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.900]   From here, let's recount the events that have occurred so far.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.980]   We went from a mild stomachache, so Diane took some Pepto-Bismol pills, to this mild
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:56.460]   stomachache transferring or morphing into ongoing piercing pain where Diane could not
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.900]   find any relief.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.340]   The pain was enough to warrant a trip to urgent care.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.580]   We have been told that she was pregnant with our first child.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:15.100]   We were then told that she was probably technically pregnant, but that the pregnancy is most likely
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.440]   not a viable one.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.460]   Then I'm told she has to undergo emergency surgery in order to have her life preserved.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.980]   For those who don't know what an ectopic pregnancy is, an ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:34.780]   egg attaches to a fallopian tube as opposed to the fertilized egg attaching to the uterus
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.820]   as in a normal pregnancy.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:44.820]   In Diane's case, the fertilized egg, aka our first child, had attached to one of her fallopian
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.340]   tubes and ruptured it.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:53.660]   The ruptured fallopian tube was a cause of massive internal bleeding.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.260]   The doctor who is going to perform the surgery comes out and explains the situation to me.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.620]   She looks at me and states the obvious, the obvious meaning that the fertilized egg, aka
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.980]   our first child, was going to die.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.740]   His life was going to be terminated.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.740]   Everything is happening extremely quickly, so I want to be able to process everything.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.780]   I say that because the doctor must have noticed me hesitate even if it was just for one second
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.940]   as I was processing everything.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:34.540]   She proceeds to tell me that she wants my permission to perform the surgery which essentially
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:40.620]   would terminate the life of our unborn child and save my wife.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.940]   Remember, the life of our unborn child is not viable, period.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:57.220]   Medical science currently has no way of saving our unborn child in that particular circumstance
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   that he was in.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.700]   The doctor went on to tell me that no matter what I say, she is going to save the life
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:10.100]   of my wife since that is just her duty, however she was still seeking my consent.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.620]   This portion of the conversation happened, I think, within a matter of seconds, but that
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:23.300]   matter of time completely belies the weightiness I felt about the subject matter and ultimately
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:30.620]   my intentional and premeditated decision to give consent to the doctor to perform the
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:39.900]   surgery thereby ending the life of our unborn child and saving my wife.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.340]   I think 5 or 10 seconds must have passed before I emphatically told the doctor to please march
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.520]   forward with the surgery and save Diane.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.620]   They had already begun prepping Diane for surgery in anticipation of my reply.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:01.900]   She's stretched out on a gurney and she's already received some type of anesthetic that's
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.940]   going to put her under so she's nearly out of consciousness.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:13.820]   I walk over to her so I could see her before her surgery.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:22.100]   I could still picture her very clearly prepped for surgery, lying on the gurney, and because
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.900]   she's under the anesthetic, she's barely conscious.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:40.580]   I have to tell you, there's something quite piercing about seeing your spouse in complete
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:51.420]   weakness with heavy eyes and barely acknowledging your presence.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:58.420]   Although the doctor herself seemed extremely knowledgeable, extremely capable, and experienced
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:05.500]   one could understand my nervousness about losing my wife in that situation.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:15.940]   After all, we had both just gone through a complete catastrophe vis-a-vis this pregnancy
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:21.740]   fiasco, this ectopic blunder.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:28.620]   Outside the doctor who told me she's performed this surgery many times and coupled with what
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:40.420]   just happened, you could see how my confidence in everyone is not at a satisfactory level.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:50.180]   Sitting there outside the OR and alone, prior to even meeting with the doctor, you better
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.540]   believe there were some desperate prayers being lifted up.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:02.180]   I didn't care if it was a public place, the life of my wife was on the line, at least
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.500]   in my mind.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:11.900]   All I could do is beg like I've never begged before.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:17.940]   Diane's parents and Diane's brother, Sam, they arrive and we're just sitting there
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.260]   praying on our own.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:28.980]   I don't remember how much time passes, but enough time passes and the doctor walks out
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.540]   to us.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:37.780]   Before she walks out to us, I caught her smiling which already spoke volumes to me.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:43.980]   The doctor relays to us that the surgery was a complete success and that Diane was going
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.800]   to be perfectly fine.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.300]   We go out to see her and she's barely conscious on the gurney, just like how I described earlier,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:13:00.580]   except perhaps even more so, but at least I know now that the worst is over.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:07.740]   We were in the hospital for a total of two days before Diane was discharged.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:13.340]   We have another huge scare a couple days later wherein Diane was rushed to the hospital again.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.760]   I again went through this whole second phase of dread and terror of losing Diane.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   As it turns out, the excruciating pain that caused her to go to the ER the second time
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.180]   was based on after effects of the ectopic pregnancy.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.000]   Of course, when that happened, I was still in trial.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.440]   I have to request a recess from trial and I rush out to the hospital, but that's a whole
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.880]   second episode I won't detail here.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:52.960]   Let me park here though and backtrack a little bit to the obvious moral dilemma I faced here.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:03.800]   As a Christian who has complete faith in the Word of God, I believe that life begins at
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.560]   conception.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.960]   I believe that life begins at conception.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:20.360]   Filled with the Word of God, science itself seems to point at life beginning at conception.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.560]   This isn't meant to be political in nature.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:31.140]   Remember in episode two when we talked about dialectics that the culture pushes on us?
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:37.080]   As we enter into this discussion, this portion of this episode, be careful not to instinctively
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:46.360]   assume a culturally forced dialectic as opposed to an objective, truthful one.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:53.980]   Culturally imposed dialectics have shown at times to blind the observer from seeing the
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:01.040]   truth of the matter or the truth of the origin.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:09.120]   I'm not stating that science seems to point at life beginning at conception because of
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.920]   republicanism.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:19.640]   What I mean is when you see how human beings are formed in the womb, there's an immensely
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:31.000]   strong medical case, biological case, physiological case, that is easily made for life beginning
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.400]   at conception.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:42.960]   WebMD states the following with respect to conception, "Fertilization happens when
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.080]   a sperm meets and penetrates an egg.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.640]   It is also called conception.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.800]   At this moment, the genetic makeup is complete, including the sex of the baby."
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:09.360]   Moreover, a baby's heartbeat could be heard as early as three weeks after fertilization.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.160]   What does the word of God say with respect to conception?
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.560]   Jeremiah 1.5 states, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.120]   And before you were born, I consecrated you.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.960]   I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations."
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.360]   Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   And before you were born, I consecrated you.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.480]   I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:46.120]   The word for knew is a word that connotes intimacy.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:52.140]   So before Jeremiah was formed, before we were formed, we were known by God.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.560]   Not like an acquaintance.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.480]   Not like an acquaintance.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.240]   Known to God in every dimension, aspect, angle.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.960]   Known to God completely, intricately, and exhaustively.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:15.000]   Psalm 139.13-16 states, "For you created my innermost parts.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.320]   You wove me in my mother's womb.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.840]   I will give thanks to you because I am awesomely and wonderfully made.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.360]   Wonderful are your works, and my soul knows it very well.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.880]   My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret, and skillfully formed in the
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.360]   depths of the earth.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:41.160]   Your eyes have seen my formless substance, and in your book were written.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:48.640]   All the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there was not one of them."
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.360]   In observable science, we know that we are woven when the DNA from a mother and father
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:02.920]   come together to form a complete, separate person, which is when?
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:11.800]   The moment an egg is fertilized by the sperm, aka conception.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:19.560]   That is completely correlative with being formed and wove.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:28.840]   What I mean to say is that the word choice used in the Bible very much describes empirical
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:37.560]   data, observable phenomenon, with respect to conception.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:46.000]   Luke 1.31-36 states, "And behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.040]   son, and you shall name him Jesus.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.200]   He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.640]   him the throne of his father David.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.280]   And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.940]   But Mary said to the angel, 'How will this be, since I am a virgin?'
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.600]   The angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.920]   of the Most High will overshadow you.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.400]   For that reason also the holy child will be called the Son of God.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.240]   And behold, even your relative Elizabeth herself has conceived a son in her old age; and she
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:25.000]   who was called infertile is now in her sixth month."
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.320]   In Luke 1.31-35, the prophecy is that you will conceive in your womb and bear a son.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.280]   So conceiving is a separate act from being born.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.120]   Conception is wholly different.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   Wholly different.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:50.800]   They're connected, but they're wholly different from being born.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.880]   Connected yet separate.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:01.240]   This distinction is interesting because the moment of conception as being the beginning
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.360]   is echoed.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.260]   In Luke 1.36, Elizabeth had conceived a son, and that description is given to her as she
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.160]   is six months pregnant.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.960]   And behold, even your relative Elizabeth herself has conceived a son in her old age; and she
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.980]   who was called infertile is now in her sixth month.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.960]   Psalm 51.5 states, "Behold, I was brought forth in guilt, and in sin my mother conceived
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   me."
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.320]   Matthew 1.20 states, "But when he had thought this over, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:49.360]   wife, for the child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   When what was conceived in her was from the Spirit, none of us would argue that at two
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.680]   to three weeks, Jesus was an actual person.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.200]   None of us would argue that.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:12.760]   The moment the conception happened, all of us would state that's when Christ was a person.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   Not when that conception had progressed along two to three weeks after.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.240]   Doesn't Hebrews 2.17 state something similar?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.360]   That He was made in every way like us?
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.560]   Hebrews 2.17, "Therefore, in all things, he had to be made like his brothers, so that
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.120]   he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.720]   propitiation for the sins of the people."
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:50.960]   Much like Adam came into being right away and not over an extended period of time.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:22:03.520]   My point is this, life begins at conception.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:13.600]   So then if life begins at conception, how does this relate to the moral dilemma I faced
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.320]   while Diane was completely unconscious and helpless?
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:26.960]   Let's chop this up, hash this out, and state some truths because if all of this is true
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.580]   then there is a huge elephant in the room that needs to be addressed.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:39.600]   Let me start off by saying that I do not believe I committed murder.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.800]   That might come off as self-serving to some.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.940]   It might sound as if I'm vacating deserved judgment on myself.
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:55.000]   You might find this hard to believe but if I did rationally and intelligibly think I
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.600]   committed murder, I would state so.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:06.560]   One of the many reasons I'm not calling it murder is because it takes away from the actual
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.400]   real murder that is committed.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:18.680]   The other reason is, suffice it to say, there was no malice in my very real and tangible
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:27.040]   consent that was given to proceed with the operation that would save Diane.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.360]   And so if we're going to come to a conclusion, we need to agree on a working definition of
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:40.000]   murder or at the very least agree on whether or not malice is a required element of murder.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.200]   Matthew 5 21-22 states, "You have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not murder.'
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.520]   And whoever commits murder shall be answerable to the court.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.240]   But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be answerable to the
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   court.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.480]   And whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be answerable to the supreme court.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.320]   And whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell."
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.380]   So we know murder is intentional taking of human life as opposed to the accidental taking
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:17.400]   of it, which is why there were different prescriptions in the law depending upon the intent.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.660]   Intentional or accidental?
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.200]   You see that in Numbers 35 16-31.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:31.920]   So we see malice, we see an intentional taking of life based on Numbers 35 16-31.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:41.240]   Moreover, Genesis 9-6 states, "Whoever sheds human blood, by man his blood shall be shed,
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.360]   for in the image of God he made mankind."
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:52.200]   Compare this to Deuteronomy 19 4-5, "Now this is the case of the one who commits manslaughter,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.640]   who may flee there and live.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.080]   When he kills his friend unintentionally, not hating him previously, as when a person
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.720]   goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.240]   the tree, and the iron head slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies,
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.600]   he may flee to one of these cities and live."
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:22.060]   God gives different prescriptions if one kills intentionally versus accidentally, and this
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:32.600]   is woven in with the presence or lack thereof of malice.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:39.440]   First John 3-15 echoes that same sentiment in Matthew 5 21-22.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.960]   First John 3-15 states, "Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:52.120]   know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him."
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.840]   In both of these passages we see that murder begins with malice.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.400]   And that is why Jesus stated, "You have already broken the commandment not to murder if you
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:10.720]   have malice in your heart."
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.040]   Reminds you a little bit of Cain and Abel, doesn't it?
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   Genesis 4 4-8, "Abel on his part also brought an offering from the firstborn of his flock
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.320]   and from their fat portions.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.840]   And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.760]   So Cain became very angry, and his face was gloomy.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.720]   The Lord said to Cain, 'Why are you angry, and why is your face gloomy?
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.480]   If you do well, will your face not be cheerful?
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:51.040]   If you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door, and its desire is for you, but you must
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.120]   master it.'
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:59.040]   Cain talked to his brother Abel, and it happened that when they were in the field, Cain rose
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.400]   up against his brother Abel and killed him."
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.080]   That's Genesis 4 4-8.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.160]   From an objective angle, there was no way the surgery wasn't going to proceed with or
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.700]   without my consent, and for good reason.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:25.000]   My unborn child was going to perish whether or not there was any intervention or attempted
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.520]   intervention.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:33.440]   Based on contemporary medical science, he was on his deathbed.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:48.520]   However, and this is a big, big however, let's not speak untruths, falsehoods, even in the
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.240]   most difficult of situations.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:28:02.880]   I absolutely consented and gave my hearty approval for the surgery to proceed.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:13.080]   The surgery that would constitute an intentional taking of a human life, even if it is by way
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.720]   of implication.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:21.760]   And if you were to put me back in that situation, 1,000 times out of 1,000, I would make the
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.360]   exact same decision.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.720]   It's really a no-brainer for me.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:38.160]   It doesn't mean my decision didn't carry any weight.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.280]   It doesn't mean that there isn't remorse.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.400]   It doesn't mean a life isn't lost.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:57.720]   It doesn't mean it was easy.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.120]   And so this is how I've chosen to remember it, understanding that my knowledge of this
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.680]   portion is incomplete and faulty.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.040]   And you'll see how it's all connected.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.840]   I give my wholehearted approval for the surgery.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:31.440]   My son is in 100% complete agreement, understanding his fate is sealed and mom needs to be saved.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:40.320]   Without even the slightest hint of resentfulness on my son's part, in fact, with a total embrace
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:49.120]   of complete unanimity, my son sacrifices his own life gladly and willingly for the joy
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:57.480]   of knowing that his mom, who is my wife, will be saved.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:05.040]   You know, I have always admired Uriah of the Old Testament.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:14.920]   So much so that if I had a son, I would want to name him Uriah, Uriah, the gentile convert
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   to Judaism, who refused comfort while his fellow soldiers were at war, even when offered
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:27.120]   by a king, not just any king, but the king through whom the Messiah would come, the Messiah,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.560]   the king of all kings, refusing to sleep in the comfort of his own home, but rather choosing
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:42.240]   the dust of the ground, murdered because of his selflessness and nobility, murdered because
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:54.840]   his virtue was too much for adulterous and what would soon be bloodstained David.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:06.520]   You better believe I will always choose to remember my first son, Uriah.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:16.960]   It is extremely hard to explain, but I want to clearly articulate the following.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:29.920]   Uriah, my first son, never even made it out of the womb, but I have to tell you, I am
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:48.280]   so incredibly proud of him and so incredibly proud to call him my son.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:59.920]   He didn't do anything, he didn't do anything, but I'm so proud of him.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.160]   Why am I sharing this with you?
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:13.520]   As Christ was going to the cross and as he was praying to the Father that the cup be
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:21.800]   taken from him, as Jesus was being scourged so much so that flesh was being ripped closer
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.880]   and closer to his bones, as he agonizingly carried that cross until he just couldn't
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.760]   do it anymore and needed to be helped by Simon from Cyrene, as he went through excruciating
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:42.440]   torture in the throes of his final breath and finally cried out to the Father, as Jesus
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   did all of that completely willingly in obedience to the Father.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:56.360]   Have you ever considered how the Father felt as he was watching all of this?
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:02.040]   Do you really think the Father felt nothing?
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:10.600]   Not only did the Father not feel nothing, the Father felt every bit of it in a way we
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:20.040]   could never even come close to realizing, imagining, or even conceptualizing.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:31.680]   All the while we confess the perfect, infinite, immutable, and impassable God.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:41.800]   Isaiah 53, 7-12 states, "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth,
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:47.320]   like a lamb that is led to slaughter, and like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.340]   so he did not open his mouth.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:54.360]   By oppression and judgment he was taken away, and as for his generation, who considered
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.680]   that he was cut off from the land of the living, for the wrongdoing of my people to whom the
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.800]   blow was due?
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.760]   And his grave was assigned with wicked men, yet he was a rich man in his death, because
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.080]   he had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in his mouth.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.200]   But the Lord desired to crush him, causing him grief.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.000]   If he renders himself as a guilt-offering, he will see his offspring, he will prolong
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.280]   his days, and the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in his hand.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.960]   As a result of the anguish of his soul, he will see it and be satisfied.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:37.200]   By his knowledge, the righteous one, my servant, will justify the many, for he will bear their
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.360]   wrongdoings.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.840]   Therefore, I will allot him a portion with the great, and he will divide the plunder
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.800]   with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and he was counted with wrongdoers.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   Yet he himself bore the sin of many, and interceded for the wrongdoers.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.360]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.520]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:26.320]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Honda.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:44.520]   Amen.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.160]   you
