[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.840]   - Yes sir, here with another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.040]   Today we got the one and only Vaughn Miller with me.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.500]   - Yeah boy.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.920]   - Appreciate you being on my guy.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Yeah, appreciate you, huh?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.840]   - You already know.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.100]   So we gonna start off in the football space.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.800]   Obviously that's where everybody know you from,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080]   but like growing up,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.000]   football is a lot different than basketball.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.760]   Like you gotta be, like it's a lot more of a physical sport
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.480]   and then you play the most physical position.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.300]   - Yeah, it's one of them.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.360]   You know, I wouldn't say it's the,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.920]   I wouldn't say it's the most physical though.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.000]   - Yeah, so like growing up though,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   like how did you, how did you get into that?
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.520]   And then how did you kind of,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   kind of get to where you have to be to play you at today?
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.560]   - Oh, bro, like my, my earliest memories
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.400]   of like my childhood, right?
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.680]   I remember like, you know, I was like two years old
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.800]   and I got in like this little pot
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.040]   in my mom's kitchen, right?
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.240]   It's like this little pot.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.080]   And I think that, I think that memory is like reinforced
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.960]   because I got like pictures that my mom
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.880]   always showed me and stuff.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.000]   But another memory that I had was like my dad,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.960]   like me hearing my dad scream, like for the first time,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.000]   like, and I ran in the room and I look in the room
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.800]   and he like yelling, like, not like in like,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.040]   not like he crying or nothing, like he hurting or nothing,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.000]   but it's like, he was like happy.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.840]   He was like so happy.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.600]   The Cowboys were on the game.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160]   I mean, the Cowboys on the TV and they had just scored
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.680]   or something, he was like going crazy.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.320]   And I just remember being like a little kid
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.880]   and seeing my daddy like reacting this way.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.680]   And like, that's where it started.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.160]   Like, I want to make my dad, like, I want to do that.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.240]   Like, I want to, whatever they doing on TV,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.080]   that's what I want.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   - That's crazy.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.920]   Yeah, that's kind of, that's kind of how it was for me.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.320]   Started early.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   My pops played hoop basketball
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.760]   and then he could put the ball in my hand, three years old.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.680]   Just got rolling from there.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.880]   You just find a passion for it.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.520]   And then it just roll from there.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.840]   But for you, so it was all that.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.600]   And then you get to the, you go to college,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.480]   get to the league, you know, you doing your thing,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.160]   become one of the best pretty quick at your position.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.240]   Then end up winning Super Bowl 50 MVP.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.480]   Talk to me a little bit about that.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.240]   Like when you got in the league and in the process
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.320]   to winning that and then that feeling.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.560]   - Yeah, honestly, like at first, like I always felt like,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.360]   you know, you just have like that belief in yourself.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.000]   Like whatever you put your mind to, you're going to do it.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.320]   I think we all like, you know, have those thoughts.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   But for me, I never thought that I would be like
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.520]   the number two pick or like fight for the Denver Broncos
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.200]   or like winning Super Bowl, do all this crazy stuff.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   I knew like deep down in my heart,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.480]   like if I worked hard enough
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.440]   and I did all the right things and I went to sleep,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   you know, like all the stuff that you do, like as a kid,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.400]   like you believe that you can make the,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.240]   you believe that you can make the league.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.480]   And I felt like that.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.200]   And it just, it just start like playing Texas A&M,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.800]   like my first two years.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160]   I was like, I was, I wasn't like, you know,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.200]   all American, nothing crazy, nothing like that.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.080]   But like my third year,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   they moved me to this outside linebacker,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.920]   like rush position.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.040]   And I just kind of like took off with it.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   At the same time I was at Texas A&M
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.040]   and I was taking easy classes.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.680]   I mean, my GPA wasn't like, you know,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.440]   my GPA wasn't like the best.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.760]   So I had to like take like classes to like help out
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.600]   with my GPA.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.160]   And one of those classes was meat production,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.760]   one-on-one chickens, turkey and quail.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.000]   So I took this class and it was an easy class.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.640]   And I was like, it's like, bro, it's so easy.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.720]   Like I don't even have to stay awake.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.240]   So I used to fall asleep in this class
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.480]   and my professor, Dr. Farnell, he used to wake me up.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.600]   He used to wake me up and like, like making me go,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.840]   like just make me like recite,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.360]   like everything that we learned in the class today.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.000]   In turn, it really made me like learn like the chicken,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.360]   like business.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.560]   And that was like my backup plan.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   It was weird.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   Like if I make it to the league, you know,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   I'm gonna use the money to start a chicken farm, man.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.640]   - Yeah, and I was actually,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.960]   I was gonna ask you about that later, the chicken farm.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.440]   I mean, everybody know you for that off the field.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.120]   How big is that like in your life and how did you,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.240]   so you got into it just as a backup plan.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.760]   - It was just, it was just one of the, I swear like, bro,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.040]   you know, you take a lot of classes, bro.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.600]   You never expect them, you know,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   you never expect them bitches to like stick like that.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.440]   But like when I, when I was learning it
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.480]   and it takes an NM, I was like, bro,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.240]   all I need is this amount of money and I can do it.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.480]   You know, I damn near using like loans to do that stuff.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.240]   Like if I like playing the league,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   I can use money to do it this way.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.560]   And I just started researching.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.600]   I hooked up with some fellow Aggies as well.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.840]   And we started Green Pastures Chicken.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.200]   It's like right outside of Elgin.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.360]   It's doing well, you know.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   - Yeah, how big is that?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   Like as far as obviously you make your bread on the field,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.040]   but is that just a passion or is it actually lucrative?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.840]   - I mean, it's, it's, it's both, you know,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.800]   you don't, you wouldn't do it.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.240]   Like if it wasn't like, you know, like just selling shit.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.800]   But it's, I mean, but it's, you know, it's, it's both,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   you know, it's something that I like,
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.280]   it's kind of like football for me off the field.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.520]   Like I like had this vision and I just attacked it.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.720]   And, you know, it just became, you know, what it is.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   We're not like Tyson or like Sanderson Farms
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   or like Butterball like that, but that's my dream.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   You know, one day is to,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.880]   is to create an operation like those guys.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.760]   A pasture raised, a pasture raised,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.880]   fully organic, humanely raised product.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.000]   Cause I feel like that is the, that's the,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.040]   that's the main certification on some of this stuff.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.440]   Cause people want to know like where their food comes from.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.920]   And I have a humanely raised product.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.560]   - So you, so you take care of your,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.480]   like you all about that as far as organic,
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.680]   raised the right way.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.160]   - They, they only have one bad day.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.240]   You know, every day is good.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.200]   And then they just, they just have one.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.520]   - You gotta plug me with some of the chicken.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.360]   - Yeah, for sure, man.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.200]   I'll send it to you.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.640]   - Cause I, I was growing up,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.280]   like I grew up vegetarian my whole life.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.880]   Then I got to the league, I was too skinny.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.360]   So they made me start eating some chicken and some salmon.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.280]   So I only eat like the healthy chicken.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.720]   So yeah, you definitely got to plug me then.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.680]   - Yeah, bro. I got you, bro.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360]   You was vegetarian your whole life?
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.320]   - I grew up vegetarian all the way until I got to the NBA.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.520]   - I thought it was like, I thought it was like a new thing,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.360]   like vegetarian.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.760]   - Nah, our parents, my mom, my mom and dad
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.720]   raised all of us that way.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   We was homeschooled, vegetarian, like all that.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.400]   Like before it was a really,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.840]   like it's more of a popular thing now.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.240]   We were doing that.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   To eat healthy, you know this,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.840]   you really got to have a chef
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.640]   or someone that's doing it for you.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.960]   Cause like a lot of these restaurants
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.800]   that say they're healthy,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   they're really not that healthy.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.000]   So we probably weren't doing it the best way,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.280]   but we were, I mean, we was trying, we was vegetarian.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.120]   - That's crazy, man.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.520]   I mean, when you think about it, I just had a son
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.360]   and like I was doing like this study,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.040]   like on what like kids eat,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.120]   because I wanted Val to be just like the biggest,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.760]   like, you know, strongest like baby ever.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.880]   And you started doing your research
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.960]   and it's like the first year,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.640]   the first year to like year and a half,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.400]   like they breastfed, like that's it.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.640]   You might supplement it with some other stuff,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.600]   but they don't start off like wanting meat
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.480]   or like needing meat.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.520]   And if you just, you know, stay in that lane,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.440]   like I can see like how somebody could be vegetarian
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.280]   their whole life.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.080]   - Yeah, you definitely got to do it the right way though.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.480]   So yeah, you just mentioned your son.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.960]   Talk about that.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.160]   Is he like, how old is he?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.320]   And then, cause we was going to talk about that too.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.960]   You, has it changed your perspective at all
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.880]   on life and what you really prioritize or value?
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.800]   - You know, people always say that,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.440]   but I think like, you know,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.040]   I've been a dad for like a while now.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.720]   Like I'm 11 years, you know,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.680]   in the National Football League.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.880]   So I got a shit load of sons everywhere.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.360]   (laughing)
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.520]   No, no, but I just always, I'm an older brother,
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.640]   you know, and my dad and my mom,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.600]   like they just been in my life since like day one.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.680]   I had great examples on how to be like a father,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.600]   I would say, like just kicking it with like my dad
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.440]   and like some of the stuff that he did with me.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.240]   I was like, man, I can't wait to like, you know,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.080]   do this with my son.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.680]   Some of the, some of the things that I learned
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.440]   like from my dad, some of the advice that I got,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.480]   like I always had him like in every single,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   which is like, you know,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.680]   it's a true blessing that me thinking about my dad,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   but you know, just by having my dad like with me
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.400]   through like every single decision that I ever had,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.960]   like to make in my life, you know,
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.720]   I always wanted to like have a son and do that same thing.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.560]   I remember when I had him, I talked to him and I said,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.400]   hey, like, so what makes you a great dad?
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.800]   Like he was like, it's so many,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.880]   he said it's so many different things
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.360]   that make you a great dad.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.800]   Okay, I was like, so what, what makes you a bad dad?
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.720]   He was like, it's just a few things
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.120]   that'll make you a bad dad.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.800]   It's all type of ways that you can parent.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.640]   It's all type of ways that you can, you know,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.720]   be in your kid life.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.080]   And you know, that's what I want to do.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   I want to play golf.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.000]   You know, that's really the only thing
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.840]   that I'm gonna force on him.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.680]   - Yeah.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.640]   - Anything else, you know, I'm--
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.280]   - What'd he say though about being a bad dad?
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   What's the ways you--
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.400]   - You know, like it's all different ways to be a bad dad.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.920]   Like you can influence your son to do things.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.320]   I feel like me, I just want to give the best in me
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.440]   because nobody's perfect.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.560]   You know, I just want to give the best in me to my son
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   and just let him create his own like, you know, lane.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.080]   You know, but I'm excited about it.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.640]   Like all the summer, like before he got here,
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   I was working on his nursery.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.160]   I was all on Pinterest, like just trying to find
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.000]   like little things.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   It was crazy.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.360]   You know, you never use the word cute,
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.200]   but like when you got like a kid,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   like it's just the word that you use.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.040]   It's just the word that like, you know,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.920]   it's all over the place.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.760]   And I got like some dope stuff for him in his nursery.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.320]   I want it to be like a cowboy vibe.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.960]   'Cause I feel like Valor is like, you know,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.840]   like a cowboy like type name.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.120]   But you know, he's five weeks old, man.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   And I'm excited, man.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.960]   Every single day he learned something new,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.000]   something different.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.840]   - That's dope.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.660]   - Yeah.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.500]   - That's dope.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.080]   Yeah, you and your dad, like everybody see how close
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   y'all are, joking around and everything.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   That's dope.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.660]   That's how I am with my dad.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.160]   Like he's one of my best friends.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.640]   The relationship changes as you get older.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.920]   Were y'all always close like that?
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.240]   Or kind of what, what made y'all get close like that?
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.880]   - You know, growing up, I thought my dad was like mean.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.420]   I was like, "Damn, my daddy mean."
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.480]   (laughing)
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.320]   I got my little brother older.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.680]   And I was like, "Damn, my daddy mean."
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.920]   Like, "Why he so strict?"
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.360]   Like, you know, like other kids doing this
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.520]   and like other kids like doing that.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.600]   And you see like other people doing this.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.440]   And it's not till like you get older that you like
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.320]   appreciate all the things that your dad like made you do.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.520]   Like being a senior in high school and having to come in
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.600]   at like 12 and like, you know, having to curfew
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.560]   and like, you know, just learning like tough lessons
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   growing up, like don't lie to 'em, don't do this.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.800]   You know, getting whoopings and like just really
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.720]   just trying to figure it out.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.240]   Like I really appreciate, you know, all that stuff
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.420]   that my dad like did for my dad and my mom.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.760]   'Cause my mom, she's a soldier too.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.280]   My mom, she's never missed, you know, anything
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.400]   that I ever participated in from like track meet
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.320]   to my basketball games.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.520]   I had hoop dreams at first.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.360]   - You hooped?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   I was gonna ask you about that.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.560]   I actually was gonna ask.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.800]   - I had hoop dreams at first, but like,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.920]   they didn't give me enough fouls.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.280]   Like I was just, I was just too physical, bro.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.440]   - My question for you was gonna be,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.840]   is it, would you think it'd be harder to go
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.960]   from the NFL to the NBA or from the NBA to the NFL?
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.280]   No bias.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.840]   - Man, it's two different body types, bro.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   Like if you get like the right body type, both can play.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.440]   Like you gotta at least be like six, four, six, like five.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.320]   You know, like I always think like Gronkowski
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.360]   could play like both.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.240]   - You know, like Justin Simmons, like,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.200]   I feel like he could play both.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.960]   He could be like a point guard and a safety in the league.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.280]   - Who's some hoopers that could play both?
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.560]   - I think LeBron James could definitely, right?
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.040]   LeBron could definitely play both.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.880]   - Zion, probably.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.000]   - I think Russell.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.720]   Yeah, Zion, Russell, Westbrook, he could definitely play both.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.760]   You know, like most of these point guards, like,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.480]   I think, you know, like John Wall, he could play like both.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   Most of these point guards, they got like,
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.040]   you know, these aggressive mindsets.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.880]   - Yeah.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.920]   - You know, and then at the same time,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.320]   not like being a great football player,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.440]   like probably like being a great basketball player.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.880]   It's not all about like just brute strength
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.720]   and like going crazy.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.520]   Sometimes you gotta be, you gotta be smart
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.680]   and you gotta be able to like outwork your guy.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.880]   So if you have like some of those things,
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.240]   which there's a lot of basketball players
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.080]   that you don't have that type of mindset,
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   you could play both.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.800]   - Right, so--
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.040]   - All you need is an arm, really, though,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.960]   and you can play like, any body type can play quarterback.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.800]   - Right.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.640]   - You can be six, six.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.480]   - Kicker or something.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320]   - Or kicker.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.140]   No, you don't wanna be no kicker.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.980]   I know some good kickers, though.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.720]   Like Brandon McManus, that's my boy.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.400]   You know, like, that's my favorite.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.280]   That's my favorite kicker,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.320]   but you don't wanna be no kicker.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   Brandon's different because he's 6'4", 210 pounds.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.360]   He can dunk.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.600]   He can play basketball.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.440]   He can throw the ball.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.480]   Like, he's fast.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.120]   He's not too fast, but, you know, he's fast
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.400]   and he can, you know, he's smart.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.240]   He can do all types of shit.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.160]   So I think Brandon McManus could play both, too.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.440]   - That's dope.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.800]   - You think any football players could play both?
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   Like, any mindsets?
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.200]   - Shoot, I don't know.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.520]   'Cause you see some football players step on the court.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.360]   They look crazy.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.180]   - That's crazy.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.020]   That's how I am.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.860]   That's me.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.680]   - They look crazy, dog.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.720]   Like, I would never play pickup with a football player
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   'cause they gonna hurt you.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.560]   - That's me.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.040]   It's just too, I'm just too fast, too fast.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.980]   I think, you know, really, that was, like, younger.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.720]   You know, I didn't, like, play it, like, from day one.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.680]   Like, it was something that, like, in my school,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.120]   in my high school, like, I had braids.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.480]   Like, yeah, like cornrows.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.320]   - Oh, for real?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.360]   - Like, yeah, that was, like, my guy.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.200]   Like, I wanted to be, like, me and my little brother.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.080]   So, I wanted to, you know, be, like, AI.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.060]   And I had braids, but it was a rule in my school district
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.200]   that if you had braids, you couldn't play basketball.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.760]   So, it kind of, like, pushed my--
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.600]   - What?
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.440]   - It kind of pushed, like, my--
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.960]   I was playing street basketball the whole time,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.760]   but it kind of pushed, like, my real, real, like,
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.200]   basketball development all the way to, like,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.160]   my ninth grade year.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   - That's weird.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.360]   I ain't never had that rule.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.840]   - If it was cool, like, I could've played both, like,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.880]   you know, since day one, and who knows
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.720]   what would happen.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.160]   But, it ain't like that.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.120]   - You ended up cool.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.580]   - I ended up being Von Miller Chicken Farmer.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.040]   - Man, so, recently, you, like, the last couple years,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.920]   you obviously, we're getting back to it now,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.560]   but you faced some adversity, you know?
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   I know all about injuries, and you went through something
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.880]   similar over the last little bit.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.080]   Talk about that.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   Like, how did it happen?
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.640]   How did you get hurt, and then what was your mindset,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.400]   you know, through the rehab and getting back?
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.240]   - Yeah.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.080]   - Are you, like, cautious at all now,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.520]   or do you feel good?
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.880]   - Man, I just feel like injuries are just, like,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.040]   part of the game.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.160]   If you look at any great player in the history
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.400]   of any sport, you know, they had to overcome some injury
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.900]   at some point in time.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.800]   We play a sport, like, our body's not designed
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.400]   to, like, run around and, like, dunk.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.120]   Even though you get these guys like you that, like,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.340]   can jump from the free throw line and dunk,
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.280]   well, like, our body's not, like, designed like that.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.240]   So if you're moving fast and you can't really predict
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.760]   everything that's going on, like, you know,
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.600]   injuries happen.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.360]   It's just really the way you respond.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   - Yeah.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.220]   - You know, I've had three, like, big injuries.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.480]   Really, my thumb, it wasn't that bad,
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.720]   but if you play football, like, not having your thumb
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.400]   is tough, but I had an ACL in 2013,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.960]   and I tore my retinaculum in my, like,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.440]   it holds down, like, the peroneal tendon,
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.680]   like, on your ankle.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.960]   It wasn't like an Achilles or anything like that,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.720]   but I still needed surgery,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.440]   and I wasn't able to, like, get back.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.520]   So it was a serious injury.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.920]   It wasn't, like, a serious surgery,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.720]   but it was, like, a serious injury.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.280]   And really, your mindset, you really just,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   you gotta respond, bro.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.260]   Like, I think what makes us great football players
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.000]   or great athletes or great basketball players
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.600]   is our ability to respond.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.360]   You play against somebody that's, you know,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.720]   that can move faster and dunk, you know, whatever.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.920]   Like, you can figure it out,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.880]   and you rely on your skill set,
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.280]   and that's the same thing.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.960]   That's the same mindset that you have
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.000]   whenever you're going through the recovery process.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.160]   - That's dope.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.060]   Man, my last football question's for you.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.800]   You gotta tell me your top three QBs,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.280]   like, the ones you hate playing against,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.920]   and then you gotta name your top five defenders
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.120]   right now in the league.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.360]   - Top five QBs, I mean, like,
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.200]   right off the top, you gotta say, like, Tom Brady.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.320]   Like, Tom Brady, you know,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.280]   Patrick Mahomes, Peyton Manning.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.320]   You know, you got Aaron Rodgers.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.920]   You know, you got so many different quarterbacks
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.800]   that, you know, wanted to do great stuff.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.040]   I love Dak Prescott as one of my favorite quarterbacks.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.200]   But, you know, top quarterbacks right now,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.360]   you gotta go with winning first.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.880]   Like, you know, Tom Brady, you know,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.540]   Peyton Manning, Patrick Mahomes.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.160]   These guys, like, these guys win.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.000]   - Yeah, they win.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.800]   - So, those would be, like, you know,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.840]   the top three quarterbacks that I've been,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.880]   that I've played, like, all the time.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.000]   I didn't play against Peyton,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.280]   but I was around him every single day,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.880]   and I saw the way he, you know, attacked defenses.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.200]   I wouldn't want to play against him, but.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.560]   - You know, it's just so crazy about that.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.960]   I actually just talked to Peyton yesterday.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.840]   He was up at the arena last night.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.760]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.580]   - Shooting with his kids,
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.640]   and I hollered at him for, like, 30 minutes,
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.200]   talking about, like, what made him different.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.800]   Like, how did he separate himself
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   as far as being one of the greats.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.160]   So, that's crazy, 'cause he was cold.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.280]   I grew up in Indianapolis.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.800]   - Oh, yeah, that's dope, that's dope.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.080]   Yeah, Peyton, yeah, Peyton, he,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   I was with him for four years, and, like,
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.560]   that's one of my favorite teammates,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.400]   favorite players ever.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.760]   I went to his Hall of Fame, like,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.120]   his Hall of Fame ceremony,
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.280]   and I went to Chattanooga's Hall of Fame ceremony, too,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.800]   so this is my second one,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.760]   but this was my first, like, after-party
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.000]   at, like, the Hall of Fame,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   'cause Coach Fangio let us stay, like, a whole day,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.120]   and the next night out there.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.680]   But, really, just being around Peyton
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.080]   and just seeing all the people that he's influenced,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.480]   that, like, being at the party,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320]   like, seeing all these people
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.080]   that helped him become who he is,
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.280]   and everybody that was there to, like, see him
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.080]   and, like, support him, you know,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.640]   go into the Hall of Fame, it was, like,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   it was incredible, man.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.960]   Like, it definitely motivated me to, like,
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.000]   you know, want to do the same thing, like, for me,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.360]   and it really, it helped me believe, like,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.920]   you know, I saw Peyton Manning do it,
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.960]   like, every single day, and that's the type of player
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.600]   that you have to be to make it there, so.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.120]   - Shoot, you on your way, fam.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.400]   - It's great, man, I'm trying, man.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.240]   I'm trying, man.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.000]   It's 11 years in.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.160]   To everybody, say, bro, I know you had a Vets come in
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.280]   and say, "Man, it go by fast."
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.400]   Like, it go by fast, it really does,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.880]   and being, this is my 11th year in,
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.720]   I started playing golf, like, recently,
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.200]   and one of the sayings that we have in golf
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.840]   is don't forget to look up,
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.320]   'cause you have some of these dope golf courses.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.680]   It could be at Pebble Beach, like, Shadow Creek,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.200]   you know, Colorado Golf Club here in Colorado is dope,
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.360]   and you kind of forget to, like, look up.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   You know, you so in the motion of, like,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.000]   putting and driving, and, you know,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.200]   you're upset about the hit before,
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   you're happy about the hit before,
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.440]   that you're just really thinking about golf,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.760]   and you don't really, you know, you forget to look up,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.760]   and this being my 11th year, like, I'm looking up,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.760]   like, being in Denver, you know,
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   being able to be in a city like this,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.120]   like, going to the Niggas game,
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.360]   you know, fucking with y'all,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.520]   like, hunting and fishing and golfing and doing,
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.640]   and being able to do all the things that make Denver,
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.160]   you know, what it is, man, it's been amazing.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.840]   - The balance, the balance, for sure.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.760]   What year is this for you?
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.600]   This is your?
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.440]   - This is my third year.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.280]   - This your third year?
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.120]   - This is my fourth year,
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.160]   no, this is my fourth year,
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.280]   but I was injured my first year, so.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   - You like Denver like that?
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.120]   I know, man.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.320]   - Nah, Denver, perfect for me,
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   'cause I don't know about you,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.600]   but I mean, I know you be, you like to get it in,
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.440]   but I like--
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.280]   - All right, what you doing?
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.160]   (laughs)
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.760]   - Well, I was at your Halloween party.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.280]   I was up there, nah.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.520]   But I love it 'cause it's, like, chill,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   like, you can have fun,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.160]   but you can also chill if you want to.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.840]   So that's why it's perfect for me.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.360]   I'm about to move, though.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.880]   I ain't got no security around here.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.720]   - Yeah, it's--
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.560]   - Got robbed twice, boy.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.380]   - Here?
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.340]   - I just got it in my garage, but--
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.820]   - Yeah, you gotta get, like, some get it, man.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.740]   You gotta, when they know where you live, man,
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.580]   it'd be different, you know?
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.420]   - Yeah.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.900]   So, but you're talking about that, like, looking up.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.620]   I know, I know, obviously,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.740]   you've influenced a lot of people football-wise.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.100]   You know, a lot of kids, you're an inspiration.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.340]   But outside of football, like, as you get older,
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.180]   you have a kid.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.580]   What do you kind of view as your purpose in life?
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.940]   - You know, for him, I just wanna,
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.080]   I just wanna support him.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.380]   Like, my dad supported me.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.860]   My dad never made me, like, play football.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.900]   My dad never made me, like, you know,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.340]   really do anything but go to school
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.380]   and, like, do my homework
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.620]   and try to be the best student academically
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.580]   that I possibly can be.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.540]   He never really made me or forced me to do anything.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.260]   And I just wanna do the same thing for him.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.500]   I just wanna support him.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.820]   I wanna be his biggest support system
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.900]   in anything that he does.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.020]   You know, he could be, you know, a candle maker.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.780]   You know, I'll just support him in that.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.280]   You know, if he wanted to do filming or acting,
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.080]   like, I just wanna support him in whatever he does,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.000]   just like my dad did for me.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.240]   - Yeah, that's dope.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.160]   - I feel like that's one of my biggest purposes in life.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.200]   You know, I just, you know, you wanna be a light.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.720]   You know, you wanna be a light around people.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.160]   You wanna influence people.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.240]   You know, sometimes you get around people
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.080]   with different energies
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.240]   and you can just feel it, like, right off the top.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.400]   You never wanna be that guy.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.920]   I just wanna, you know, influence
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.760]   and, you know, be a light to everybody that I fuck with.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.480]   - Shoot, I mean, everybody that's on here is like,
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.640]   it's 'cause I respect 'em and, you know,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.760]   we've linked up a couple times, seen you a couple times,
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.120]   but everybody around here who I've talked to
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.080]   is always a man, Von's the dopest dude ever.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.320]   Like, you gotta get him on there.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.120]   He's so much more than a football player, so.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:34.960]   - I appreciate that.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.020]   - That's dope, yeah.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.600]   Shoot, two more questions for you
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.840]   and then we'll call it a wrap.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.680]   - I got you, fam.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.520]   - So, I need, what's your favorite thing about you
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.600]   and then what's your least favorite thing about you?
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   If you could name those two.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.280]   - My favorite thing about me is,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.640]   like, you could put me in really any room
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.480]   and, like, I feel like I could relate to somebody in there.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.360]   I never really feel, like, out of my element,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.080]   no matter where I go, no matter who I'm around.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.120]   I always feel like, that socially, like,
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.320]   I can fuck with everybody, you know?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.960]   Like, not like you wanna fuck with everybody,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.040]   but I feel like that's one of my,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.240]   that's one of my greatest things,
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.360]   just to be able to talk to, you know, anybody.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.280]   Sometimes, you know, like,
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.120]   sometimes the energy don't be right
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.800]   for, like, you know, you to, like, talk to just anybody.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.560]   But, like, if you put me in, like, a house party
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.880]   or something, like, man, like.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.260]   - Yeah.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.440]   - You know, I know, like, I'm gonna have a son.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.840]   I go to PTA meetings now.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.080]   Like, anything like that, like, you know, I'm gonna kill it.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.600]   And I feel like that's one of the best things about,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.320]   like, in a locker room, like,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.280]   I feel like that's one of the greatest things about me.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.200]   A brother, being a brother, being a, you know, a son.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.960]   Like, I feel like those are some of the greatest things,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.440]   'cause I'm a team guy,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.640]   and I always wanna see, like, the people around me,
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.160]   like, win or succeed, and I'm gonna try to help them.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.000]   - You know.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.840]   - I'm gonna try to assist them in doing that.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.000]   And I feel like that's one of my greatest things,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.920]   that I'm a great teammate.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.360]   You can put me in any room,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.480]   and I'm socially able to make it happen.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   I feel like, you know, one of the things that,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.040]   about me that I don't like,
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.320]   I probably wish,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.000]   you know, I really, you know, I'm like, I love myself.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.840]   - Oh, me, that's a--
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.680]   - There's a couple of tattoos,
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.040]   there's a couple of tattoos that, you know.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.640]   - There's a couple of tattoos that, like,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.400]   you know, I feel like I could make it better.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.880]   - That's it, that's all that y'all like?
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.040]   - No, if I could change something, though,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.680]   like, I wish, like, I had, like, long, like, hair,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.880]   like, you know, like, and I could sing.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.760]   Like, if I had, like, hair, and I could sing,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.560]   and I was the same Von, like, right now,
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.120]   like, the same Von I am today,
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.760]   but I had, like, real, real long hair, and I could sing,
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.600]   you know, I like--
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.640]   - That would be the total package.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.480]   - Yeah, you know.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.800]   (laughing)
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.680]   But that's, you know, if you're thinking about it,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.520]   that's funny.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   - I already know it, it's funny.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.560]   Now, I asked that, someone asked me that question
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.880]   the other day, that's why I asked it to you.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.240]   It took me a minute to figure it out, too.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.080]   - Yeah.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   - Last question for you, dog, just about the world,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.840]   you know, there's so much going on right now in the world.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   If you could, you know, one of your purposes
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.200]   is to influence, if you could change one thing,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.760]   or help in one way with everything going on in the world,
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.600]   what would you change about what's the state
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   of the world right now?
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.080]   - Man, there's so many serious things that's going on
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.560]   in the world right now, like, you know,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.120]   if you're thinking about it, it's 2021,
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.960]   and we got, like, global warming, you know,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.800]   like, all type of stuff, and we got racism, like,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.960]   those are, like, two of the craziest things, like,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.160]   you know, in the world right now,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.560]   if you think about, like, just global problems, right,
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.240]   like, global warming, like, we slowly, like,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.560]   we slowly, like, baking ourselves,
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   we slowly, like, destroying the planet,
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.240]   and it's, we got all of this other technology,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.120]   we doing all these other things, crazy, like,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.600]   we got cell phones, we can't, we can't figure out,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.320]   like, global warming, or try to find, you know,
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.200]   some sustainable, like, resources,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.880]   we using gasoline and fossil fuels,
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.320]   and we still using them, it's 2021,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.520]   it's all type of, you know, problems in that area, too,
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.560]   and, like, with racism, it's just, like,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.080]   it's, it's the, it's the weirdest thing, you know, like,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.120]   it's just as, it's, it's just as serious,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.960]   it's a global problem, just like,
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.360]   just like global warming, bro, like,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.680]   you don't like somebody because, like,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.080]   the color of, like, their skin, or, like,
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.960]   where they from, or, like, you judge 'em,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.160]   or, like, you, you stereotype 'em off top,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.480]   like, it's, instead of, like, you know,
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.920]   really, like, learning, and, like, you know,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.440]   trying to figure people out, just off top,
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.360]   like, you see 'em, and you, like,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.440]   profile 'em, like, off top, that's, like,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.840]   you know, ridiculous. - It's crazy.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.920]   Both of those things are like, out of all the things
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.520]   that our world is like dealing with,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.320]   like those are like two things that like,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.780]   just like blow my mind, like.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.480]   - Have you experienced a lot of racism?
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.440]   - You know, I have experienced racism,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.380]   but I wouldn't say like I experienced it a lot.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.160]   Like not that, probably like that, I don't see,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.640]   like I guess I'm so in like my bubble and like,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.920]   you know what I'm doing, like I, you know,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.480]   on a personal level, like, you know, I see it all,
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.840]   I see it, you know, you see it on TV, you can,
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.320]   I'm aware of it, it's happened to me like a couple of times,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.600]   like you go overseas and like, people don't like,
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.880]   you're not like the same like Von Miller,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.360]   like, you know, like what is football, you know?
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.640]   - It's like a black dude.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.260]   - Like, you know, some people know you,
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.440]   but some people just like, are totally like oblivious
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.880]   and like, you go over there and you just, you know,
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.320]   you a regular guy and you experience, you know,
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.440]   things that, that normal, like, you know,
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.600]   people that's not like, like entertainers
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.960]   or like sport athletes, cause you know, people,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.800]   they treat you different, like, you know,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.880]   you just a regular guy and you're able to experience it
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.360]   and you're able to relate on like,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.560]   some of the serious things that's, you know,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.160]   really happening in the world, man.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.400]   And like racism and global warming is two of the craziest
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.280]   things that I feel like I could say.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.800]   - You like going overseas and kind of trying to become
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.080]   like a regular person for a little bit,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.920]   blend in for a little bit?
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.360]   - I love, I love traveling, bro.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.720]   I love going overseas, bro, especially like Europe.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   I went to, we went on, we went on tour with Drake in 2000
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.320]   and I think it was like 2017, the beginning of 2017, bro.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.280]   And we were there for like, probably like the end
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.320]   of February until like April, bro, like.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.160]   - For real?
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.360]   - Yeah, for like, it was like, it was like 35, 40 nights.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.200]   - That's dope.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.000]   - And we went to the, we went to the show,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.320]   we went to the same show.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.680]   Cause it was the same exact show because, you know,
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.280]   it might change like one or two things,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.960]   but it's still like the same like lineup.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.480]   And I probably went to like 19 or 18 or 19 shows.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.520]   - Was it that little baby one,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.040]   the one that had the yellow Lambo?
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.720]   - No, that was, that was the American tour.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.640]   This was the Boy Meets The World tour
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.320]   where he went to like Amsterdam, Paris.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.160]   - Ah, okay.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.960]   - Yeah, cause he had the first tour with, you know,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.920]   with the Migos and they had like a tour
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   and that was an American tour.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.800]   And then a year later they did it.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.920]   But instead of taking the Migos, he took like,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.080]   he took Young Thug and he had like some Europe,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.000]   like some like gigs and like some local, you know,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.120]   like European, like London rappers, English rappers.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.520]   He would have them open up for him and stuff.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.720]   But we went to like Germany and went to all these
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.040]   different places like Amsterdam, Ireland, you know,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.320]   and you experiencing like, you going on tour like with him.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.880]   So you get to see it like in a different light, bro.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.200]   It was, it was amazing.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.040]   It was really one of the top moments of my life.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.880]   But at the same time, I was able to experience like
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.640]   some of these things that you wouldn't normally experience.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.480]   - Right.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.000]   - Like racism and all that type of stuff.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.680]   - Yeah.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.520]   - Shoot, man.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.360]   Well, I appreciate you, man.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.560]   - I appreciate you, bro.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.400]   - Yeah, man.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.240]   - Appreciate you.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.080]   - Yeah, bro.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.920]   For sure.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.760]   - We out.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.260]   (electronic music)
