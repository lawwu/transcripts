[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.840]   - Yes sir, here with another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.040]   Today we got the one and only Vaughn Miller with me.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.500]   - Yeah boy.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.920]   - Appreciate you being on my guy.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Yeah, appreciate you, huh?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.840]   - You already know.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.100]   So we gonna start off in the football space.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.800]   Obviously that's where everybody know you from,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080]   but like growing up,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.000]   football is a lot different than basketball.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.380]   Like you gotta be like,
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.640]   like it's a lot more of a physical sport
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.460]   and then you play the most physical position.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.300]   - Yeah, it is one of them.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.920]   You know, I wouldn't say it's the most physical though.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.880]   - Yeah.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   So like growing up though,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.340]   like how did you get into that?
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.440]   And then how did you kind of get to where you at be
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   to play you at today?
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.580]   - Oh, but like my earliest memories
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.400]   of like my childhood, right?
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.680]   I remember like, you know, I was like two years old
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.820]   and I got in like this little pot
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.040]   in my mom's kitchen, right?
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.240]   It was like this little pot.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   And I think that, I think that memory is like reinforced
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.960]   because I got like pictures that my mom
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.200]   always show me and stuff.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.040]   - Yeah.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.000]   - But another memory that I had was like my dad,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.960]   like me hearing my dad scream like for the first time,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.000]   like, and I ran in the room and I look in the room
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.800]   and he like yelling, like, not like in like,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.040]   not like he crying or nothing, like he hurting nothing,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.000]   but it's like, he was like happy.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.580]   He was like so happy the Cowboys were on the game.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.040]   I mean, the Cowboys on the TV
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.540]   and they had just scored or something.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.640]   He was like going crazy.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.260]   And I just remember being like a little kid
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.840]   and seeing my daddy like reacting this way.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.640]   And like, that's where it started.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.140]   Like, I want to make my dad like, I want to do that.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.220]   Like I want to, whatever they doing on TV,
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.060]   that's what I want.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.060]   - That's crazy.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.900]   Yeah, that's kind of, that's kind of how it was for me.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.280]   Started early.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.940]   My pops played hoop basketball
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.740]   and then he put the ball in my hand, three years old.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.660]   Just got rolling from there.
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.860]   You just find a passion for it.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.460]   And then it just roll from there.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.820]   But for you, so it was all that.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.580]   And then you get to the, you go to college,
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.500]   get to the league, you know, you doing your thing,
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.160]   become one of the best pretty quick at your position,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.260]   then end up winning Super Bowl 50 MVP.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.460]   Talk to me a little bit about that.
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.460]   Like when you got in the league
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.340]   and in the process to winning that and then that feeling.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.560]   - Yeah, honestly, like at first, like I always felt like,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.340]   you know, you just have like that belief in yourself.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.020]   Like whatever you put your mind to, you're going to do it.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.340]   I think we all like, you know, have those thoughts.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.340]   But for me, I never thought that I would be like
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.540]   the number two pick or like fight for the Denver Broncos
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.220]   or like winning Super Bowl, do all this crazy stuff.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.220]   I knew like deep down in my heart,
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.500]   like if I worked hard enough
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.460]   and I did all the right things and I went to sleep,
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.740]   you know, like all the stuff that you do, like as a kid,
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.420]   like you believe that you can make the,
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.260]   you can be, you believe that you can make the league.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.500]   And I felt like that.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.220]   And it just, it just start like playing Texas A&M,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.820]   like my first two years.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.180]   I was like, I was, I wasn't like, you know,
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.220]   all American, nothing crazy, nothing like that.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.100]   But like my third year,
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.580]   they moved me to this outside linebacker,
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.940]   like rush position.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.060]   And I just kind of like took off with it.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.600]   At the same time, I was at Texas A&M
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.060]   and I was taking easy classes.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.700]   I mean, my GPA wasn't like, you know,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.460]   my GPA wasn't like the best.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.820]   So I had to like take like classes to like help out
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.660]   with my GPA.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.220]   And one of those classes was meat production,
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.800]   one-on-one chickens, turkey and quail.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.060]   So I took this class and it was an easy class.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.700]   And I was like, like, bro, it's so easy.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.780]   Like I don't even have to stay awake.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.300]   So I used to fall asleep in this class
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.540]   and my professor, Dr. Farnell, he used to wake me up.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.660]   He used to wake me up and like, like making me go,
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.380]   like just make me like recite like everything
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.420]   that we learned in a class today.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.060]   In turn, it really made me like learn like the chicken,
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.420]   like business.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.620]   And that was like my backup plan.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.460]   It was weird.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.500]   Like if I make it to the league, you know,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.740]   I'm gonna use the money to start a chicken farm, man.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.020]   - Yeah.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.700]   And I was actually, I was gonna ask you about that later.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.020]   The chicken farm.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.500]   I mean, everybody know you for that off the field.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.180]   How big is that like in your life and how did you,
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.300]   so you got into it just as a backup plan.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.260]   - It was just, it was just one of the,
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.100]   I swear like, bro, you know, you take a lot of classes, bro.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.640]   You never expect them, you know,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.840]   you never expect them bitches to like stick like that.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.500]   But like when I, when I was learning it
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.540]   and it takes an NM, I was like, bro,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.300]   all I need is this amount of money and I can do it.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.540]   You know, I damn near using like loans to do that stuff.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.300]   Like if I like playing the league,
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.900]   I can use money to do it this way.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.620]   And I just started researching.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.660]   I hooked up with some fellow Aggies as well.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.900]   And we started Greener Pastures Chicken.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.260]   It's like right outside of Elgin.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.100]   It's doing well.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.940]   You know?
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.760]   - Yeah. How big is that?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.380]   Like as far as obviously you make your bread on the field,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.100]   but is that just a passion or is it actually lucrative?
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.860]   - I mean, it's, it's, it's both, you know,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.860]   you don't, you wouldn't do it.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.380]   Like if it wasn't like, you know, like just selling bread.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.380]   Yeah. But it's, I mean, but it's, you know, it's,
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.020]   it's both, you know, it's something that I like,
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.340]   it's kind of like football for me off the field.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.580]   Like I like had this vision and I just attacked it.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.780]   And, you know, it just became, you know what it is.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.060]   We not like Tyson or like Sanderson Farms
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.060]   or like Butterball like that, but that's my dream.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.900]   You know, one day is to,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.980]   is to create an operation like those guys.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.820]   A pasture raised, a pasture raised,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.940]   fully organic, humanely raised product.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.060]   Cause I feel like that is the, that's the,
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.100]   that's the main certification on some of this stuff.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.500]   Cause people want to know like where their food comes from.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.980]   And I have a humanely raised product.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.620]   - So you, so you take care of your,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.540]   like you all about that as far as organic,
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.740]   raised the right way.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.220]   - They, they only have one bad day.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.300]   You know, every day is good.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.660]   And then they just,
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.580]   - You gotta plug me with some of the chicken.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.420]   - Yeah, for sure, man.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.260]   I'll send it to you.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.700]   - Cause I, I was growing up,
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.340]   like I grew up vegetarian my whole life.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.940]   Then I got to leave, I was too skinny.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.420]   So they made me start eating some chicken and some salmon.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.340]   So I'll need like the healthy chicken.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.820]   So yeah, you definitely got to plug me then.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.700]   - Yeah, bro. I got you, bro.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.420]   You, you was vegetarian your whole life?
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.340]   - I grew up vegetarian all the way until I got to the NBA.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.420]   - I thought it was like,
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.580]   I thought it was like a new thing.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.420]   Like vegetarian meat.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.060]   - Nah, our parents, my mom,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.740]   my mom and dad raised all of us that way.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.260]   We was homeschooled, vegetarian, like all that.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.420]   Like before it was a really,
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.900]   like it's more of a popular thing now.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.300]   We were doing that.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.340]   To eat healthy, you know this,
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.900]   you really got to have a chef
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.700]   or someone that's doing it for you.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.980]   Cause like a lot of these restaurants
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.820]   that say they're healthy, they're really not that healthy.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.020]   So we probably weren't doing it the best way,
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.300]   but we were, I mean, we was trying, we was vegetarian.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.140]   - That's crazy, man.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.980]   I mean, when you think about it,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.820]   I just had a son and like, I was doing like this,
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.060]   this study, like on what like kids eat,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.900]   because I wanted,
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.180]   I wanted Val to be just like the biggest,
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.820]   like, you know, strongest, like baby ever.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.900]   And you started doing your research
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.980]   and it's like the first year,
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.660]   the first year to like year and a half,
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.180]   like they, like they breastfed.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.420]   Like that's it.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.660]   You might supplement it with some other stuff,
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.620]   but they don't start off like wanting meat
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.500]   or like needing meat.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.540]   And if you just, you know, stay in that lane,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.420]   like I can see like how somebody could be vegetarian
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.260]   their whole life.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.100]   - Yeah, you definitely got to do it the right way though.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.460]   So yeah, you just mentioned your son.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.980]   Talk about that.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.180]   Is he like, how old is he?
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.340]   And then, cause we was going to talk about that too.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.580]   You, has it changed your perspective at all on life
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.860]   and what you really prioritize or value?
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.820]   - You know, people always say that,
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.460]   but I think like, you know,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.020]   I've been a dad for like a while now.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.660]   Like I'm 11 years, you know, in National Football League.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.940]   So I got a shit load of sons everywhere.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.300]   (laughing)
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.940]   No, no, but I just always, I'm an older brother, you know,
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.380]   and my dad and my mom, like,
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.540]   they just been in my life since like day one.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.620]   I had great examples on how to be like a father,
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.540]   I would say, like just kicking it with like my dad
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.380]   and like some of the stuff that he did with me.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.220]   I was like, man, I can't wait to like, you know,
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.060]   do this with my son.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.220]   Some of the things that I learned, like from my dad,
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.380]   some of the advice that I got,
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.460]   like I always had him like in every single,
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.660]   which is like, you know,
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.660]   it's a true blessing me thinking about my dad.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.660]   But, you know, just by having my dad like with me
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.380]   through like every single decision that I ever had,
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.940]   like to make in my life, you know,
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.660]   I always wanted to like have a son and do that same thing.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.540]   I remember when I had him, I talked to him and I said,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.340]   hey, like, so what makes you a great dad?
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.780]   Like he was like, it's so many,
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.820]   he said it's so many different things
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.340]   that make you a great dad.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.780]   Okay. I was like, so what, what makes you a bad dad?
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.700]   He was like, it's just a few things
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.100]   that I make you a bad dad.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.780]   It's all type of ways that you can parent.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.620]   It's all type of ways that you can, you know,
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.700]   be in your kid life.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.100]   And, you know, that's what I want to do.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.060]   I want to play golf.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.020]   You know, that's really the only thing
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.220]   that I'm gonna force on him.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.620]   Anything else, you know, I'm-
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.260]   - What'd he say though about being a bad dad?
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.100]   What's the ways you can-
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.380]   - You know, like it's all different ways to be a bad dad.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.900]   Like you can influence your son to do things.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.260]   I feel like me, I just want to give the best in me
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.580]   because nobody's perfect.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.540]   I just want to give the best in me to my son
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.540]   and just let him create his own like, you know, lane.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.020]   You know, but I'm excited about it.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.580]   Like all the summer, like before he got here,
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.620]   I was working on his nursery.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.660]   I was all on Pinterest,
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.820]   like just trying to find like little things.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.940]   It was crazy.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.300]   You know, you never use the word cute,
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.140]   but like when you got like a kid,
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.100]   like it's just the word that you use.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.980]   It's just the word that like, you know,
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.860]   it's all over the place.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.700]   And I got like some dope stuff for him in his nursery.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.260]   I want it to be like a cowboy vibe.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.900]   'Cause I feel like Valor is like, you know,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.780]   like a cowboy like type name.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.060]   But you know, he's five weeks old, man.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.020]   And I'm excited, man.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.900]   Every single day he learns something new,
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.900]   something different.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.980]   - That's dope, that's dope.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.900]   Yeah, you and your dad,
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.460]   like everybody see how close y'all are,
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.900]   joking around and everything.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.780]   That's dope.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.620]   That's how I am with my dad.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.100]   Like he's one of my best friends.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.620]   The relationship changes as you get older.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.900]   Were y'all always close like that?
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.260]   Or kind of what made y'all get close like that?
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.900]   - You know, growing up, I thought my dad was like mean.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.220]   I was like, "Damn, my daddy mean."
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.500]   (laughing)
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.340]   I got my little brother over there.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.660]   And I was like, "Damn, my daddy mean."
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.940]   Like, "Why he so strict?"
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.380]   Like, you know, like other kids doing this
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.500]   and like other kids like doing that.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.620]   And you see like other people doing this.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.980]   And it's not 'til like you get older
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.580]   that you like appreciate all the things
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.340]   like that your dad like made you do.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.780]   Like being a senior in high school
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.500]   and having to come in at like 12
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.580]   and like, you know, having a curfew
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.780]   and like, you know, just learning like tough
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.340]   like lessons growing up.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.060]   Like don't lie to 'em, don't do this.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.180]   You know, getting whoopings
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.700]   and like just really just trying to figure it out.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.620]   Like I really appreciate, you know,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.420]   all this stuff that my dad like did for my dad and my mom.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.780]   'Cause my mom, she's a soldier too.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.740]   My mom, she's never missed, you know,
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.300]   anything that I ever participated in
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.300]   from like track me to my basketball games.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.500]   I had hoop dreams at first.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.340]   - You hoop?
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.660]   I was gonna ask you about that.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.500]   I actually was gonna ask.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.340]   - I had hoop dreams at first,
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.900]   but like they didn't give me enough fouls.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.260]   Like I was just, I was just too physical, bro.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.420]   - My question for you was gonna be,
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.500]   is it, would you think it'd be harder
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.340]   to go from the NFL to the NBA
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.940]   or from the NBA to the NFL?
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.260]   No bias.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.820]   - Man, it's two different body types, bro.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.380]   Like if you get like the right body type,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.820]   both can play.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.420]   Like you gotta at least be like six, four, six, like five.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.300]   You know, like I always think like Gronkowski
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.340]   could play like both.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.220]   - Like Justin Simmons, like I feel like he could play both.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.980]   He could be like a point guard in a safe in the league.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.300]   - Who's some hoopers that could--
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.980]   - I think LeBron James could definitely--
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.820]   - Bron.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.020]   - LeBron could definitely play both.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.860]   - Zion, probably.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.020]   - I think Russell.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.100]   Yeah, Zion, Russell, Westbrook,
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.700]   he could definitely play both.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.340]   You know, like most of these point guards,
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.740]   like I think, you know, like John Wall,
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.580]   he could play like both.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.420]   Most of these point guards,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.020]   they got like, you know, these aggressive mindsets.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.860]   - Yeah.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.900]   - You know, and then at the same time,
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.300]   not like being a great football player,
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.420]   like probably like being a great basketball player.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.860]   It's not all about like just brute strength
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.700]   and like going crazy.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.500]   Sometimes you gotta be, you gotta be smart
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.660]   and you gotta be able to like outwork your guy.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.860]   So if you have like some of those things,
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.260]   which there's a lot of basketball players
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.060]   that you don't have that type of mindset,
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.100]   you could play both.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.060]   - Right.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.900]   So--
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.060]   - All you need is an arm really though,
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.140]   and you can play like,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.300]   any body type can play quarterback, you know.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.140]   - Right.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.980]   - You can be 6'6".
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.800]   - Or kicker or something.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.640]   - Or kicker.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.480]   No, you don't wanna be no kicker.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.300]   I know some good kickers though,
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.740]   like Brandon McManus, that's my boy.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.380]   You know, like that's my favorite.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.300]   That's my favorite kicker,
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.340]   but you don't wanna be no kicker.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.340]   Brandon's different because he's 6'4", 210 pounds.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.620]   He can dunk, he can play basketball.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.460]   He can throw the ball.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.460]   Like he's fast.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.140]   He's not too fast, but you know, he's fast.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.380]   And he can, you know, he's smart.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.220]   He can do all types of shit.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.140]   So I think Brandon McManus could play both too.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:15.980]   - That's dope.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.780]   - You think any football players could play both?
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.740]   Like, you know what I'm saying?
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.220]   - Shoot, I don't know.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.540]   'Cause you see some football players step on the court.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.380]   They look crazy.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.200]   - That's crazy.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.040]   That's how I am.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.880]   That's me.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.700]   - They look crazy, dog.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.700]   - I would never play pickup with a football player
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.700]   'cause they gonna hurt you.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.540]   - That's me.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.020]   It's just too, I'm just too fast.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.960]   I think, you know, really that was like younger.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.700]   You know, I didn't like play it like from day one.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.620]   Like it was something,
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.340]   like in my, at my school, in my high school,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.460]   like I had braids like A.I., like cornrows.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.300]   - Oh, for real?
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.340]   - Like A.I., that was like my guy.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.180]   Like I wanted to be like A.I., me and my little brother.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.060]   So I wanted to, you know, be like A.I.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.060]   and I had braids,
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.060]   but there was a rule in my school district
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.180]   that if you had braids, you couldn't play basketball.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.860]   So it kind of like pushed my-
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.700]   - What?
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.540]   - It kind of pushed like my,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.980]   I was playing street basketball the whole time,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.620]   but it kind of pushed like my real, real
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.260]   like basketball development
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.180]   all the way to like my ninth grade year.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.180]   - That's weird.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.380]   I ain't never heard that rule.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.860]   - If it was cool, like I could have played both like,
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.380]   you know, since day one and who knows what would happen,
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.180]   but it ain't like that.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.140]   - You ended up cool.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.580]   - I ended up being Von Miller Chicken Farmer.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.060]   - Man, so recently you, like the last couple of years,
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.940]   you obviously getting back to it now,
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.540]   but you faced some adversity, you know,
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.700]   I know all about injuries
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.420]   and you went through something similar
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.860]   over the last little bit.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.060]   Talk about that.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.900]   Like, how did it happen?
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.740]   How did you get hurt?
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.980]   And then what was your mindset, you know,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.380]   through the rehab and getting back?
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.100]   Are you like cautious at all now?
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.540]   Or you feel good?
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.380]   - Man, I, you know,
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.020]   I just feel like injuries are just like part of the game.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:56.020]   If you look at any great player in the history of any sport,
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.380]   you know, they had to overcome some injury
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.900]   at some point in time.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.820]   We play a sport, like our body's not designed
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.420]   to like run around and like,
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.140]   even though you get these guys like you that's like,
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.340]   can jump from the free throw line and dunk,
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.260]   we're like, our body's not like designed like that.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.860]   So if you're moving fast and it's,
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.340]   you can't really predict everything that's going on.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.540]   Like, you know, injuries happen.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.380]   It's just really the way you respond.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.220]   - Yeah.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   I've had three, I've had three like big injuries.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.500]   Really my thumb, it wasn't really that bad,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.380]   but if you play football,
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.180]   like not having your thumb is tough.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:31.180]   But I had an ACL 2013 and I tore my retinaculum
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.460]   and my, like it holds down like the perineal tendon,
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.700]   like on your ankle.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.940]   It wasn't like the Achilles or anything like that.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.740]   But I still, I still needed surgery
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.380]   and I wasn't able to like get back.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.460]   So it was a serious injury.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.860]   It wasn't like a serious surgery,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.660]   but it was like a serious injury.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.220]   And really, your mindset, you really just,
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.220]   you gotta respond, bro.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.180]   Like I think what makes us great football players
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.940]   or great athletes or great basketball players
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.540]   is our ability to respond.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.300]   You play against somebody that's, you know,
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.660]   that can move faster and dunk, you know, whatever.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.860]   Like you can figure it out
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.820]   and you rely on your skillset.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.180]   And that's the same thing.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.900]   That's the same mindset that you have
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.980]   whenever you're going through the recovery process.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.100]   - That's dope.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.020]   Man, my last football questions for you.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.740]   You gotta tell me your top three QBs,
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.220]   like the ones you hate playing against.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.900]   And then you gotta name your top five defenders
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.100]   right now in the league.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.980]   - Top five QBs, I mean, like right off the top,
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.140]   you gotta say like Tom Brady.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.220]   Like Tom Brady, you know, Patrick Mahomes, Peyton Manning,
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.260]   you know, you got Aaron Rodgers.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.860]   You know, you got so many different quarterbacks
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.740]   that, you know, wanted to do great stuff.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.580]   I love Dak.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.940]   Dak Prescott is one of my favorite quarterbacks.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.140]   But, you know, top quarterbacks right now,
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.940]   you gotta go with winning first, like, you know,
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.460]   Tom Brady, you know, Peyton Manning, Patrick Mahomes.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.100]   These guys, like, these guys win.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.940]   - Yeah, they win.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.740]   - So those would be like, you know,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.780]   the top three quarterbacks that I've been,
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.820]   that I've played like all the time that,
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.900]   I didn't play against Peyton,
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.220]   but I was around him every single day
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.780]   and I saw the way he, you know, attacked defenses.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.100]   I wouldn't want to play against him, but.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.460]   - You know, it's just so crazy about that.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.900]   I actually just talked to Peyton yesterday.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.780]   He was up at the arena last night.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.700]   - That's cool.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.540]   - Shooting with his kids
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.620]   and I hollered at him for like 30 minutes,
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.180]   talking about like what, like what made him different?
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.780]   Like how did he separate himself
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.300]   as far as being one of the greats?
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.140]   So that's crazy 'cause he was cold.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.220]   I grew up in Indianapolis.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.740]   - Oh yeah, that's dope, that's dope.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.020]   Yeah, Peyton, yeah, Peyton, he,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.220]   I was with him for four years and like,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.260]   that's one of my favorite teammates, favorite players ever.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.700]   I went to his Hall of Fame, like,
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.620]   his Hall of Fame ceremony.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.700]   And I went to Chantin Bailey's Hall of Fame ceremony too.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.300]   So this is my second one,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.380]   but this was my first like after party
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.260]   at like the Hall of Fame 'cause Coach Fangio
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.700]   let us stay like a whole day and the next night out there.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.180]   But really just being around Peyton
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.540]   and just seeing all the people that he's influenced,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.020]   that like being at the party,
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.580]   like seeing all these people that helped him
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.820]   become who he is and everybody that was there
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.220]   to like see him and like support him,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.740]   you know, going to the Hall of Fame,
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.820]   it was like, it was incredible, man.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.260]   Like it definitely motivated me to like,
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.060]   you know, want to do the same thing, like for me.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.780]   And it really, it helped me believe like, you know,
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.260]   I saw Peyton Manning do it like every single day.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.260]   And that's the type of player
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.820]   that you have to be to make it there.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.460]   - Sure, you and your wife, huh?
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.660]   - It's great, man, I'm trying, man.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.500]   I'm trying, man.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.460]   It's 11 years in, everybody say, bro,
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.620]   I know you had a Vets come in and say, man, it go by fast.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.660]   Like it go by fast, it really does.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.060]   And being, this is my 11th year in,
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.940]   I started playing golf like recently.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.860]   And one of the sayings that we have in golf is,
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.100]   don't forget to look up.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.580]   'Cause you have some of these dope golf courses.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.020]   You could be at Pebble Beach, like Shadow Creek,
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.460]   you know, Colorado Golf Club here in Colorado is dope.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.580]   And you kind of forget to like, look up.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.500]   You know, you so in the motion of like putting and driving
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.420]   and you know, you're upset about the hit before,
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.380]   you're happy about the hit before
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.740]   that you're just really thinking about golf.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.060]   And you don't really, you know, you forget to look up.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.140]   And this being my 11th year, like I'm looking up,
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.020]   like being in Denver, you know,
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.900]   being able to be in a city like this,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.500]   like going to the Nuggets game, you know,
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.700]   fucking with y'all, like hunting and fishing
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.780]   and golfing and doing,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.860]   and being able to do all the things that make Denver,
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.860]   you know, what it is, man, it's been the balance.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.100]   The balance for sure.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.820]   - But what year is this for you?
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.660]   This is your?
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.500]   - This is my third year.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.340]   - This your third year?
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.340]   - This is my fourth year, but I was injured my first year.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.380]   So, this is my fourth.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.300]   - You like Denver like that?
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.140]   I know, man.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.300]   - Nah, Denver, perfect for me.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.140]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.580]   but I mean, I know you be, you like to get it in,
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.420]   but I like-
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.260]   - I like what you doing.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.180]   (laughing)
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.740]   - Boy, I was at your Halloween party.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.260]   I was up there, nah.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.500]   But I love it 'cause it's like chill.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.460]   Like, you can have fun,
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.100]   but you can also chill if you want to.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.820]   So, that's why it's perfect for me.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.340]   I'm about to move, though.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.820]   I ain't got no security around here.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.660]   - Yeah, it's-
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.500]   - Got robbed twice, boy.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.340]   - Here?
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.300]   - They just got in my garage, but-
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.740]   - Yeah, you gotta get some gated, man.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.700]   You gotta, when they know where you live, man,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.540]   it'd be different, you know?
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.380]   - Yeah.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.860]   So, but you talk about that, like looking up.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.740]   I know, obviously, you've influenced a lot of people
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   football-wise, you know, a lot of kids.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.060]   You're an inspiration.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.300]   But outside of football, like, as you get older,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.140]   you have a kid.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.540]   What do you kind of view as your purpose in life?
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:22.020]   - You know, for him, I just want to support him.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.340]   Like, my dad supported me.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.820]   My dad never made me, like, play football.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.580]   My dad never made me, like, you know, really do anything,
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.340]   but go to school and, like, do my homework
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.580]   and try to be the best student academically
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.540]   that I possibly can be.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.540]   He never really made me or forced me to do anything.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.220]   And I just want to do the same thing for him.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.500]   I just want to support him.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.820]   I want to be his biggest support system
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.900]   in anything that he does.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.020]   You know, he could be, you know, a candle maker.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.780]   You know, I'll just support him in that.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.300]   You know, if he wanted to do filming or acting,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.100]   like, I just want to support him in whatever he does,
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.020]   just like my dad did for me.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.260]   - Yeah, dope.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.140]   - I feel like that's one of my biggest purposes in life.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.180]   You know, I just, you know, you want to be a light.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.700]   You know, you want to be a light around people.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.140]   You want to influence people.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.220]   You know, sometimes you get around people
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.060]   with different energies,
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.260]   and you can just feel it, like, right off the top.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.380]   You never want to be that guy.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.900]   I just want to, you know, influence
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.700]   and, you know, be a light to everybody that I fuck with.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.500]   - Shoot, I mean, everybody at Vaughn here is, like,
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.660]   it's because I respect him, and, you know,
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.740]   we've linked up a couple times, seen you a couple times,
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.140]   but everybody around here who I've talked to
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.100]   is always a man, Vaughn's the dopest dude ever.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.300]   Like, you got to get him on there.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.100]   He's so much more than a football player, so.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.940]   - I appreciate that.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.020]   - That's dope, yeah.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.580]   Shoot, two more questions for you,
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.780]   and then we'll call it a wrap.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.620]   - I got you, fam.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.540]   - So, I need, what's your favorite thing about you,
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.580]   and then what's your least favorite thing about you,
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.580]   if you could name those two?
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.260]   - My favorite thing about me is,
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.620]   like, you could put me in really any room,
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.860]   and, like, I feel like I could relate to somebody in there,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.340]   or, like, I never really feel, like, out of my element,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.060]   no matter where I go, no matter who I'm around.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.060]   I always feel, like, that socially, like,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.220]   I can fuck with everybody, you know?
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.940]   Like, not like you want to fuck with everybody,
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.220]   but I feel like that's one of my greatest things,
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.340]   is just to be able to talk to, you know, anybody.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.460]   Sometimes, you know, like, sometimes the energy
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.900]   don't be right for, like, you know,
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.780]   you to, like, talk to just anybody,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.540]   but, like, if you put me, like, at a house party
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.420]   or something, like, man, like, ooh, like, you know,
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.420]   I know, like, I'm going to have a son,
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.700]   I go to PTA meetings now, like, you put anything like that,
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.100]   like, you know, I'm going to kill it,
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.580]   and I feel like that's one of the best things about,
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.300]   like, in a locker room, like,
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.260]   I feel like that's one of the greatest things about me,
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.180]   a brother, being a brother, being a, you know, a son,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.940]   like, I feel like those are some of the greatest things,
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.820]   'cause I'm a teen guy, and I always want to see, like,
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.700]   the people around me, like, win or succeed,
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.300]   and I'm going to try to help them,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.820]   I'm going to try to assist them in doing that,
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.020]   and I feel like that's one of my greatest things,
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.380]   I'm a great teammate, you can put me in any room
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.460]   and I'm socially able to make it happen.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.860]   I feel like, you know, one of the things about me
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.320]   that I don't like, I probably wish,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.880]   you know, I really, you know, I'm like, I love myself.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.720]   - I don't mean that.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.020]   - It's a couple of tattoos that, you know.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.820]   - It's a couple of tattoos that like, you know,
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.340]   I feel like I could, you know, make it better.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.820]   - That's it, that's all you got left.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.020]   - No, if I could change something though,
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.660]   like I wish like I had like, like long like hair,
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.860]   like, you know, like, and I could sing,
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.740]   like if I had like hair and I could like sing,
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.500]   and I was the same Von, like right now,
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.060]   like the same Von I am today,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.740]   but I had like real, real long hair and I could sing.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.580]   You know, I like.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.660]   - You'd be the total package.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.500]   - Yeah, you know.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.740]   (laughing)
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.580]   But that's, you know, if you're thinking about it,
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.420]   that's funny.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.240]   - I already know.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   - I'm good though.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.500]   - Nah, I asked that, someone asked me that question
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.860]   the other day, that's why I asked it to you.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.220]   It took me a minute to figure it out, too.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.700]   - Yeah.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.020]   - Shoot, last question for you, dog, just about the world.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.480]   You know, there's so much going on right now
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.020]   in the world, if you could, you know,
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.580]   one of your purposes is to influence,
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.380]   if you could change one thing or help in one way
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.700]   with everything going on in the world,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.620]   what would you change about what's,
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.540]   what the state of the world right now?
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.300]   - Man, there's so many serious things that,
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.980]   that's going on in the world right now.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.060]   Like, you know, if you think about it, it's 2021,
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.860]   and we got like global warming, you know,
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.380]   like all types of stuff, and we got racism,
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.660]   like, those are like two of the craziest things,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.040]   like, you know, in the world right now,
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.440]   if you think about like just global problems, right,
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.160]   like global warming, we slowly like,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.480]   we slowly like baking ourselves,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   we slowly like destroying the planet,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.160]   and it's, we got all of this other technology,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.720]   we doing all these other things, crazy,
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.680]   like we got cell phones, we can't,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.080]   we can't figure out like global warming,
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.140]   try to find, you know, some sustainable like resources,
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.800]   we're using gasoline and fossil fuels,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.280]   and we still use them, it's 2021,
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.480]   it's all type of, you know, problems in that area too,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.540]   and like, with racism, it's just like,
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:05.300]   it's, it's the, it's the weirdest thing, you know,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.120]   like, it's just as, it's, it's, it's just as serious,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.980]   it's a global problem, just like,
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.360]   just like global warming, bro, like,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.680]   you don't like somebody because like,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.840]   the color of like their skin, or like where they from,
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.860]   or like you judge them, or like you,
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.320]   you stereotype them off top, like,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.480]   it's, instead of like, you know,
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.960]   really like learning, and like, you know,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.480]   trying to figure people out, just off top,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.440]   like you see them, and you like profile them like off top,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.240]   that's like, you know, ridiculous.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.080]   - It's crazy.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.200]   - Both of those things are like,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.280]   out of all the things that our,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.560]   that our world is like dealing with,
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.360]   like, those are like two things that like,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.800]   just like blow my mind, like.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.880]   - Have you experienced a lot of, a lot of racism?
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.480]   - Um, you know, I have experienced racism,
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.400]   but I wouldn't say like I experienced it a lot,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.040]   like, not that I, probably like that,
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.200]   I don't, I don't, I don't see,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.120]   like, I guess I'm so in like my bubble,
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.720]   and like, you know, what I'm doing, like I,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   you know, on a personal level, like,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.320]   you know, I see it, I see it, you know,
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.880]   you see it on TV, there's, you can,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.600]   I'm aware of it, it's happened to me,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.640]   like a couple of times, like,
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   you go overseas, and like, people don't like,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.920]   you're not like the same, like, Vaughn Miller,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.400]   like, you know, like, what is football, you know?
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.720]   - It's like a black dude.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.320]   - Like, you know, some people know you,
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.720]   but some people just like, are totally like,
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.800]   oblivious, and like, you go over there,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.000]   and you just, you know, you a regular guy,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.360]   you experience, you know, things that,
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.440]   that, that normal, like, you know,
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.600]   people that's not like, like, entertainers,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.440]   or like, sport athletes, 'cause, you know,
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.880]   people, they treat you different, like.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.720]   - Yeah.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.760]   - You know, you just a regular guy,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.840]   and you're able to experience it,
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.360]   and you're able to relate on, like,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   some of the serious things that's,
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.120]   you know, really happening in the world, man,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.760]   and like, racism, and global warming,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.280]   is two of the craziest things that I feel like I could say.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.680]   - You like, you like going overseas,
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   and kind of, trying to become like,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.040]   a regular person for a little bit,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.880]   blend in for a little bit?
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.320]   - I love, I love traveling, bro.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.680]   I love going overseas, bro, especially like, Europe.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   I went to, we went on, we went on tour with Drake in 2000,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   and I think it was like, 2017?
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.800]   The beginning of 2017, bro, and we were there for like,
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.440]   probably like, the end of February,
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.280]   until like, April, bro, like.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.120]   - For real?
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.840]   - Yeah, for like, it was like, it was like,
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.320]   35, 40 nights.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.160]   - That's dope.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.960]   - And we went to the, we went to the show,
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.280]   we went to the same show,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.600]   'cause it was the same exact show,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.560]   because, you know, they might change like,
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.760]   one or two things, but it's still like,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.920]   the same, like, lineup.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.400]   And I probably went to like, 19, or 18 or 19 shows.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.480]   - Was it that little baby one,
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.960]   the one that had the yellow Lambo?
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.640]   - No, that was, that was the American tour.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.600]   This was the Boy Meets The World tour,
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.280]   where he went to like, Amsterdam, Paris.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.120]   - Ah, okay.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.680]   - Yeah, 'cause he had the first tour with,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.040]   you know, with the Migos, and they had like,
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.080]   - And that was an American tour,
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.720]   and then a year later, they did it.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.880]   But instead of taking the Migos, he took like,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.000]   he took Young Thug, and he had like, some Europe,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.720]   like, some, like, gigs, and like, some local,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.880]   you know, like, European, like, London rappers,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.280]   English rappers, and he would have them open up for him,
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.640]   and stuff, but we went to like, Germany,
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.280]   and went to all these different places,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.000]   like, Amsterdam, Ireland, you know,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   and you experiencing, like, you going on tour,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.400]   like, with him, so you get to see it like,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.240]   - Yeah.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.160]   - In a different light, bro, it was, it was amazing.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.040]   It was really one of the top moments of my life,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.640]   but at the same time, I was able to experience,
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.400]   like, some of these things that
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.640]   you wouldn't normally experience.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.480]   - Right.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.160]   - Like, racism, and all that type of stuff, yeah.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.920]   - Shoot, man, well, I appreciate you, man.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.520]   - I appreciate you, fam.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.960]   - Yeah, man, appreciate you.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.080]   - Yeah, bro, for sure.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.920]   - We out.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.080]   (upbeat music)
