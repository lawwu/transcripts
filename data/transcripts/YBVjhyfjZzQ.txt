[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.560]   >> Okay, a number of years ago, Jack Ice and Bill Bernstein could
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.680]   have an informal chat as part of the agenda.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.840]   We all know what Jack wants, Jack gets.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.800]   So it's become a regular part of our conference agenda ever since, and
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.400]   it's now affectionately known as the Barside Chat.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.560]   So without further ado, I'd like to briefly introduce the two participants of
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620]   this non-political discussion.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.720]   >> [LAUGH] >> I have to say that every year.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.560]   >> [LAUGH] >> Okay, our distinguished guest of honor
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.280]   is the founder of the Vanguard Group and
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.760]   president of Vanguard's Global Financial Markets Research Center.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.120]   He created Vanguard in 1974 and served as chairman and
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.920]   chief executive officer until 1996, and as senior chairman until 2000.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.080]   He entered the investment field immediately following his graduation from
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.160]   Princeton University, magna cum laude, with a degree in economics in 1951.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.640]   If I listed all of his honors and achievements,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.240]   which most of you already know, we wouldn't have any time left for the Barside Chat.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.480]   So I'll dispense with that, and I ask you to please welcome our special guest of
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.960]   honor, Mr. Jack Vogel.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:30.960]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.200]   >> Jack's companion for
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.640]   this Barside Chat is a retired neurologist who helped co-found Efficient Frontier
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.000]   Advisors.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.280]   He's written a number of best-selling titles on both finance and
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.040]   economic history.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.360]   He holds both a PhD in chemistry and an MD.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.600]   Please welcome one of the smartest guys I know, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.480]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.080]   >> It's all yours.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.440]   >> Okay, well, I have been sternly warned that any speakers who mumble will be
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.800]   promptly cut off, so please, before that happens, start shouting, stop mumbling.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.280]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.760]   >> I'm going to lead off, Jack,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.600]   with a question that is kind of a counterfactual.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.160]   Let's assume that it's 20 or so years ago, and
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.760]   the success of your concept of a popularly available retail fund has succeeded.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.720]   You've got the Index Trust 500 fund, the total stock market,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   you're starting to dabble in international markets, and maybe even some slice and
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   dice in the US market, and that's working out pretty well.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.960]   And let's start from that point forward.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.760]   What would you have done differently from that point forward?
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.680]   >> Are you allowed to think before you answer a question in this day in America
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.200]   or not?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.800]   >> You have as long as you need.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   >> Okay, but I guess if I had to do it over again, what would I do differently?
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.160]   Well, you only went back 20 years, and
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.600]   Vanguard was pretty much formulated almost immediately, 40 years ago as it happened.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   And so 20 years ago, I guess if I had done, would do anything differently,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.040]   I would probably have a little less impact on marketing, be less of a marketing person.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.360]   Some of the funds I started, Vanguard Quantitative Portfolios it's called,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.680]   later named, Vanguard Growth and Income, Vanguard Asset Allocation,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.600]   which Bert Malfield used to say, it'll never work.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.160]   And it worked for 20 years, and then it stopped working.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.600]   And I should have known, man, I should have had a 25-year time horizon.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.840]   And so starting some funds that really, probably I shouldn't have started.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.480]   And we continue to do a little bit of that, I'm not too, these aren't my problems.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.240]   Because I could do it any differently if I wanted to.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.160]   Things like the managed payout portfolio.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.640]   I think anything that thinks it can improve much on indexing is fundamentally,
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.800]   that's the burden that every fund has to have.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   Will it do better than the market index?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.640]   I just don't see how you can say that.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.200]   On the other hand, we all have, even Bogle,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.120]   after all these years of learning better, of knowing better,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.960]   still has too much of a marketing hat on.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.160]   It's not that we need the money.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.520]   My God, $3 trillion?
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.880]   What does that mean to somebody who's written a book called Enough?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.160]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   >> So, I'm more worried about that.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.460]   But you end up kind of thinking, or I did,
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.760]   it was a good idea to kind of preempt other people from coming into the field.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.320]   So we didn't want to allow people to have something that would properly be a Vanguard
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.960]   show at higher prices.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.200]   So we basically said, we're gonna start this fund or that fund,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.080]   index funds of various types.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.080]   And basically say, stay out of here, you're not gonna be able to compete with us.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.160]   I think we maybe could push that too far, and I think maybe I pushed it too far.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.280]   But in terms of deep progress, in terms of policy, strategy,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.840]   structures, which I'll talk a little bit about later.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.200]   I just plain don't have any deep regrets.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.360]   Little regrets or something else again.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.760]   I've made so many mistakes that in my life, that I tell people.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.240]   My wife has forbidden me to write any more books.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.080]   And I said, if I were to write another book,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.280]   it would be the longest book I've ever written.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   And it would be called Mistakes I Have Made.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.800]   >> And that would go way back in my early
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.880]   career, when I was just so stupid, it defies description.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.480]   But the big advantage I have, I think, is I was willing to learn from my stupidity.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.840]   And we all should be able to do that.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.000]   Learning from your own mistakes is much deeper and more profound.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.400]   We're learning from other people's mistakes, because somehow the lesson
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   isn't quite as sharply drawn as to when you just kind of
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.640]   shoot yourself in the foot or in the brain or some other place.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.160]   It can be equally painful.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.120]   So I don't, no deep regrets.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.560]   >> Well, that segues into another question,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.880]   which is, should Van Gogh be advertising?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.680]   >> Well, that was my marketing hack.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.440]   And I didn't know how else, cuz we had no sales force.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.560]   And how else to get the information out of the Van Gogh fund.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.600]   So we had kind of an introductory fund that was likely to hack the page.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.280]   It was sort of eternal.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.760]   And we had a new fund, we kind of told the world that we were going to do it.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.920]   Absolutely laid down the rule, which we have continued to observe.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.240]   No performance advertising, no yield advertising.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.800]   I'm a little too far back.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.320]   I didn't obey that warning.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.480]   Now I can hear the echo, that's good.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.560]   >> [LAUGH] >> So sorry about that.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.400]   You missed nothing.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.000]   >> [LAUGH] >> But
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.240]   it was supposed to be very modest.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.440]   It was.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.760]   And I have to concede that I wasn't too spittin' with spending
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.200]   $50 million of our shareholders' money on Vanguarding, our sort of campaign slogan.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.840]   I don't think we need that.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.640]   But I have conceded that you have to have a name like that with gang at the end.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.360]   It's a good thing we weren't Merrill Lynch.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.560]   >> [LAUGH] >> And
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.200]   I wish I had a little bit of advertising.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.960]   Because then when you start advertising, it would be very observable.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.880]   But I did a little, and I don't think we really do a lot now.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.560]   I don't know what the cost of the Internet is.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.960]   I'm just not familiar with that.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.800]   But we do quite a bit along those lines.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.360]   And it's okay.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.920]   It's not gonna, the cost involved in terms of unit costs are really quite trivial.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.560]   I don't change our expense ratio.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   And I own it.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.880]   But I'm more into the principle of saying, as I did at the very beginning,
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.720]   as Ralph Waldo Emerson, build a better mousetrap and
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.680]   let the world be a path, and the world will be a path to your door.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.200]   And that was how we began a long time, we'll talk about later.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.680]   And so I think advertising is not a good thing.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.880]   But very limited in the way we do it, it's okay.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.840]   A lot of people are out there, particularly in the go-go years.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:01.560]   Not the go-go years, but in the late 90s with all the tech funds and so on.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   They're advertising their returns.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.760]   How would you like 40% a year?
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.960]   I, for one, would like 40% a year.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.160]   I just don't know how to get it.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.200]   And so, it's not as bad as marketing.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.840]   Advertising is not as bad as marketing.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.720]   Because marketing, when you think about it, what is marketing?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.080]   Marketing is finding out what clients want and giving it to them.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.280]   And that's the way beer works.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.440]   That's why we have light beer, I guess.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.120]   I don't do light, I do ale, just for the record.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.360]   And rarely, sometimes in the summer.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.840]   But you're always trying to find out that these big consumer products companies do this,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.760]   or are doing this all the time,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.520]   and trying to add a little bit of something to something else,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.880]   and sell a little bit more.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.040]   Because that's what they think the public wants.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.880]   And it's a good idea for cereal,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.280]   probably a good idea for automobiles, and beer, and God knows what else.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.640]   But I think a terrible idea for investing.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.200]   And the great public out there usually wants the wrong thing.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.560]   What they read in the paper in the last two or three weeks.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   Imagine how many gold funds there would be around,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.760]   after gold had that huge run,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.240]   I guess about two and a half years ago.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.640]   Maybe three years ago, two years ago.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   So, I know it sounds old-fashioned,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.120]   but I'd let your term speak for itself,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.840]   record speak for itself.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.560]   People start to trust you,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.960]   as many, many people trust Vanguard,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   and have that the way you basically build business.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.360]   I don't think we need to worry about that again for a long time.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.680]   And we have happily a formula that really always can't go wrong.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.840]   And I tell people, we haven't promised you a fund that beat the market 15 years in a row.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.440]   We haven't promised you a Magellan fund that gets to a hundred,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.600]   gets to a billion dollars and is now about 20 million.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.720]   We had a good performance and then a bad, money flows in and out.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.080]   We're right down the middle.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   And as I constantly advise people,
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.560]   and I advise all of you,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:23.280]   we make no guarantee except we will give you your fair share of the return of any portion of the market,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.920]   particularly stock and bond market that you would like to invest your money in.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.280]   And that fair share means if the market goes to hell in a handbasket,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.080]   your investments will go to hell in a handbasket.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.240]   And we should say that.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.440]   Maybe you shouldn't use a word like hell.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.120]   Maybe you should too, I don't know.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.800]   Going to heck in a handbasket doesn't cut it.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.320]   So, that's it.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   Thank you. I mean it sort of reminds me of the famous Henry Ford aphorism,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.080]   that if you ask the public what it wants, it will tell you it wants a faster course.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:12.800]   The Shiller P/E, the CAPE, Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio has gotten a lot of attention.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.680]   It's become a real topic of conversation, which is worrisome in itself.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.880]   You know, it's still around, what, 25 or so.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.840]   You know, what do you think of Shiller's measure?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.240]   Do you think it can be improved upon?
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.040]   Should we not be paying so much attention to it?
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.840]   Well, anyone that has a formula to tell you whether the market is high or low,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:42.640]   is kidding, either trying to kid you or has been kidding themselves.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.360]   And nobody knows this.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:51.440]   Take the Shiller P/E, last 10 years ago, it was right where it is now.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.400]   I think it's around 25 or 26, and it hadn't changed.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.800]   So, it's giving a warning now that the market is too high.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.760]   It was giving a warning then that the market was too high.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.200]   And since then, the market has gone up 60 percent.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.120]   Earnings and dividends have gone up, well,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.000]   earnings have gone up, I think, 70 percent.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.880]   Dividends have gone up 100 percent.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.280]   So, it was a false signal 10 years ago.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.760]   Some look at it and enjoy it.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.840]   I do, and I often use it when I go on CNBC.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.040]   And it's trying to deflate everybody's expectations.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.880]   But there is no answer.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.600]   Shiller is fun to look at, it's intelligent.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.520]   Don't just look at the last year's earnings and the next year's earnings.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.920]   We'll do a little bit of history,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.640]   but it doesn't tell you very much of anything.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.040]   We can get right down to the greatest hazard.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.160]   Yeah, I would certainly agree with that.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.200]   You know, if you, people are always fond of saying, well, gosh,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.360]   the historical average is 16 and a half or whatever it is.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.080]   But, you know, to get that number,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.480]   you've got to include data that goes all the way back almost to the Civil War,
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.720]   which was a different era when industrial stocks were selling four times.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.840]   I mean, that, that's, that's gone.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.080]   And if you look at it over the last 50 years,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.760]   you use it to draw a regression slope where the normal value appears to be closer to 20.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:13.800]   So I think the value of 26 really doesn't tell you all that much.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.760]   Well, let's, let's ask the shift gears a little bit and get into some personalities.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.440]   Let's, let's go to the sunglass question.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.760]   Which is that, you know,
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.920]   there have been star managers for forever,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.880]   starting with what, Ivor Kruger and then Jeremy Tsai and, you know,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.160]   Peter Lynch and Bill Miller and now another guy.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.520]   And I'm wondering, do you think the public has,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.720]   has learned anything or do you think that the birth rate is higher than the learning curve?
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.920]   Well, the problem with this business is it has a kind of
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.640]   distribution arm that has to sell something.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.880]   And if you want to talk about,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.440]   you've got a client out there and you want to sell them a certain thing,
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.160]   it has to have a good performance.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.000]   And there's nothing else for you to show up and say,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.480]   well, our expense ratio is only 10 basis points instead of 100.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.560]   I think your client is thinking,
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.360]   "Duh, what does that matter?"
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.480]   Particularly since the 100 doesn't even cover what the fund spends,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.280]   like transaction costs, marketing costs, and things of that nature.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   So, it's an action business.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.400]   Investment advisors basically feel the need to tell you to do something.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.040]   Portfolio managers, and I keep thinking of it,
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.840]   and this is an interesting point.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.720]   I keep thinking of Peter Lynch,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.280]   manager of the Magellan Fund,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.880]   going to see Ned Johnson on January 2nd of a given year.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.840]   And he says, "Ned, or Mr. Johnson,
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.560]   I looked at my portfolio and I think it's fine for the year,
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.240]   and I'll see you a year from now.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.720]   I'm not going to do anything in one year."
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.880]   The odds are 51 percent that that will improve the fund's performance during the year.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.720]   It's improved. And all that transaction, it costs money.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.200]   And sometimes it adds value,
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.600]   but more often than not, it's value.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.640]   Well, it's returns. But the portfolio manager,
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.200]   and people are saying, "What are you doing?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.800]   You've got to be doing something."
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.600]   And turn off all those,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.760]   I won't get into the scandal we have about our Pennsylvania judges,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.360]   and yet, their pornographic emails.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.840]   But that's another story.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.880]   But you feel the need to do something.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.440]   Trustees of an endowment fund feel the need to do something.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.000]   Investment advisors feel the need to do something.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.600]   Financial advisors or RIAs feel the need to do something.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.320]   And I'll give you one little anecdote.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.920]   I was speaking out in Milwaukee a few years ago,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.200]   and I went through my little platform of bonds and stocks to keep the ratio right,
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.840]   and don't do anything else.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.320]   So, one of the financial RIAs in the room comes up to me afterwards and said,
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.360]   "Look, I know your advice is right,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   but think of me a minute.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.280]   Think of me." He said,
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.440]   "I've got a client." And he comes in and set up his portfolio in 65 percent stocks,
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.640]   35 percent bonds, and he comes back a year later.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.480]   He says, "What do I do now?" He said, "Nothing. Nothing."
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.360]   He said, "I guess that's okay to go a whole year without doing anything."
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.440]   Comes back a year later, says,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.280]   "I must be doing something now, I didn't do anything last year.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.080]   How about this year?" "Don't do anything."
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.440]   Comes back a year later, this is now the third year,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.200]   "I got to do something now, this is just crazy."
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.680]   And the advisor says, "No,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.800]   stay the course, stay exactly where you are."
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.440]   And he said, "The client then says to me,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.200]   'What do I need you for?' How do I answer that question?"
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.440]   And I said, "The answer is easy.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.840]   Just tell him you need me to keep you from doing anything."
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.000]   And there really is, and we make fun of it.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.680]   But there's a lot of truth in that.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.160]   This is a business where activity is big.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.120]   Never have admired it as it is today.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.480]   I mentioned the spider thing turning over at that awful rate,
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.040]   and it traded,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.520]   I guess I mentioned this to Christine Vance earlier.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   The spider traded $160 billion in the last five days,
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.120]   and the assets of the spider are $160 billion.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.840]   It's a five-day turnover of 100 percent,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   an annual return over of 5,000 percent,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.280]   and I'm the kind of person that thinks
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.960]   three percent of the turnover is kind of pushing him on my side.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.760]   And there's a big difference between three percent and 5,000 percent.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.520]   So, the trading environment obviously
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.200]   riches Wall Street and impoverishes therefore the investor.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.440]   So, that's why stay the course works.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:56.160]   >> Yeah. There's a wonderful front line from about 50 years ago,
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.520]   that featured tech funds,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.200]   the hot tech funds of the late '90s,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.960]   and there was about a 30-second clip of Garrett Van Wagner,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.480]   who was a famous tech fund manager at the time,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.720]   with one phone in each hand shouting the words to each phone,
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.960]   and even then it just gave me the willies.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.280]   I thought there's something wrong here.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:24.240]   All right. Well, let's shift gears a little bit here and talk about some ladies.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.480]   The first lady I want to talk to you about is Mary Jo White.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.280]   I have a- we talked about this last night.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.080]   I have an odd sense of disquiet about that you pointed out that she is a prosecutor,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.720]   and we would hope that she would perhaps use those skills in her job.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.640]   But I don't think that's necessarily a good fit for her skills.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.600]   I think that the job of being the SEC commissioner is a chairman of the SEC,
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:05.080]   is a more broad moral and if you will.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.440]   I'm wondering if you have that same sense of disquiet about her.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   >> Well, I think she was clearly brought in with the idea,
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.720]   at least a major part of the appointment.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.200]   Leaving aside the fact that most administrations really want to have
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.640]   more women in them and most of them do these days is that she's a prosecutor,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.520]   a tough prosecutor, A, and B,
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.560]   she knows Wall Street.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.280]   She's been a lawyer in there for,
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.440]   I don't know, 35 years or something, 40.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.280]   In that sense, if the mission is prosecute,
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.000]   get people in jail,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.760]   get big penalties, she was a good choice.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.640]   Unfortunately, that's a very narrow,
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.880]   as Bill says, a very narrow version of what the SEC does.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.920]   They're there to protect the consumer, the investor.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.200]   It's got to be a big complicated business.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.960]   They are outgunned at every level by these costs,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.760]   by the high-frequency traders.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.960]   I don't know who at the SEC can out-talk
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.880]   the high-frequency traders about that complex business,
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.680]   which is probably not a bad business,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.200]   it's got to be regulated more.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.520]   But it's speed in the markets and they had tremendous lead times.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.760]   Then she's also affected and people have done very little talk about this.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.040]   I talked a little bit about it at the Senate Finance Committee when I testified there on
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.560]   September 16th as their lead witness and it was about the retirement system.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.880]   But I was talking about regulation and the Don Frank law itself,
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.600]   as well as the Department of Trade Regulations,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.720]   are allowed to impose standards of fiduciary duty on
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.780]   everybody involved in the system except the people that manage money.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.520]   How can that be?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.600]   I mean, they're not allowed to impose
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.200]   the standard of fiduciary duty on money managers in either case.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.720]   That's ridiculous. That's the most important fiduciary,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.840]   the most important toucher of other people's money around.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.760]   But she can't go beyond what the Congress gave her.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.400]   So I'm trying to make a little excuse for her.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.120]   I think she's integrity laden.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.520]   I think she's maybe over her head as an administrator of this huge agency.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.440]   I think she must struggle each day with figuring
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.160]   out there's so many things going on in the system.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.240]   She must be struggling. I don't know who she has that's
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.040]   really good in terms of division heads.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.120]   I'm not so good. I think the guy who's running the mutual fund division.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.200]   I think it's okay, but not a hell-raiser like the ones I used to work with.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.600]   We used to go along famously.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.840]   I don't even know this guy.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.640]   On the other hand, I'm not the preeminent figure anymore.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   Yeah. I mean, I guess I expect too much.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.080]   When I look out at the brokerage industry and the investment company industry,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.200]   I see a moral swamp.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.160]   I keep waiting for the person who's the SEC chairperson to deal with that,
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.320]   and it just never happens.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.160]   Mary Jo White, I think,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.600]   takes a very legalistic narrow view of things and says,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.320]   "Is the law being broken?"
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.560]   The problem is the law itself.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.200]   Unfortunately, the law itself doesn't make it legal,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.360]   most of the activities that I think exercise,
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.400]   Jack, myself.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.640]   Well, I'll bring another lady in,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.480]   and this is so political that I don't want Mel to hit his ejection button,
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.600]   so I won't even mention her name.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.920]   But this woman, who's a very prominent woman,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.840]   has said that the President of the United States
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.760]   cares more about Wall Street than about Main Street.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   I'm wondering what you think about that.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.120]   Do you think that's true?
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.240]   No, I don't think so.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.920]   We are wrapped up in an outrageous political system,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.840]   where there is so much money coming out of Wall Street,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.080]   and you even get somebody, a Democrat, like Chuck Schumer,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.440]   who is, I think, I'm not sure which committee he's headed down there with.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.400]   He could do something about this outrageous,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.080]   this is a really good example of this outrageous tax treatment legislatively,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.160]   in which hedge fund managers get
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.680]   their returns of capital gains rates and not ordinary income rates.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.840]   If a Democrat, he should be for that.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.120]   Where does Senator Schumer get all his money from? Wall Street.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.680]   So even the liberals in Congress don't dare to take on the hedge fund industry.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.760]   I think that's wrong.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.960]   I think that's tragic,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.800]   and I think Obama has talked a little bit about this,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.160]   but he's limited by the university's regulations around him,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.040]   and he too was supported by Wall Street.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.280]   That seems to be fading quite a bit.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   I'm not sure anybody's supporting him now,
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.800]   which probably means he's doing a great job.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.480]   Think about that for a minute.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.240]   No, I don't think he's against the individual investor at all,
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.640]   but more in favor of Wall Street than the individual.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.520]   He's got the right values.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.760]   He seems to maybe be,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.200]   as the conventional wisdom tells you these days,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.280]   maybe he has a policy of being too deep a thinker and not strong enough an actor,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.720]   and not a deep enough thinker and too strong an actor.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   So we're somewhat contrasted there.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:27.200]   Okay. Well, let's back up again a little bit.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.440]   This time only six years.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.920]   I mean, if I could back up 30 years,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.400]   and I think for anybody in this room could back up 30 years,
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.800]   what we would have done is obvious,
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.560]   which is we would have purchased Microsoft with the IPO we wanted at the beach.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.000]   We would have invested in Vanguard funds.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.600]   So with that benefit of hindsight,
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.640]   let's go back to September 15th, 2008.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.120]   You have two of the biggest financial corporations in
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.480]   the world that either are going to go bankrupt or about to go bankrupt.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.600]   How would you have handled it differently?
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.280]   Obviously, it was handled tolerably well.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.800]   Knowing what you know now,
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.840]   what would you have done differently?
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.520]   Well, I mean, I'm not an expert in why the Fed and New York Fed,
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.840]   and particularly the Secretary of the Treasury did what they did,
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.280]   but I think they did what they could do.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.120]   They're limited, I happen to believe,
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.440]   stimulus package from the margin.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.760]   There was no, as emerging from the litigation between
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.280]   Hank Greenberg against AIG or against the government's treatment of AIG.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.400]   There's no question that the government had to do something,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.000]   and they were on the edge of bankruptcy.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.600]   Whether they did it perfectly,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.760]   whether people like Goldman Sachs were protected from
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.320]   taking haircuts on the paper they had with AIG.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.200]   I wondered about that then and I wonder about that now.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.640]   But I wasn't there.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.320]   You have to take into account a lot of things in the financial system.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.760]   The lubricate space we do in the US starts to fall apart.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.920]   So particularly under pressure,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.160]   I don't think you could have done any better.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.680]   Sure, little things might have been done better,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.040]   but they had to let me even go.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.320]   There's arrogant guys up there,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.680]   pretty disgraceful the way they handled the finances of that firm,
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.720]   and they were not the only ones.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.840]   I also thought the money market people got off very,
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.120]   very lightly, faking their asset value,
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.960]   what they call institutional money markets.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.120]   So there are other things that they might have done better,
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.560]   but that ended up in litigation and the government just didn't win the case.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.120]   That's always hard to win when you're outgunned with high-priced lawyers.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.400]   So I think in an imperfect world,
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.920]   that system of financial crisis was handled as well as it could be.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   I think that increasingly comes out of the reading of the testimony.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.160]   I guess it's now over, the AIG trial.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.320]   Yeah. Gene Fama did a very interesting interview about a year ago.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.080]   Jeff Summers in the New York Times,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.000]   and he said he would have just nationalized banks,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.320]   and Jeff Summers, you'd almost see his jaw drop.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.600]   He said, "That's not exactly the answer I would expect from a Chicago libertarian."
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.440]   Fama held his ground, he said, "Yeah,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.840]   that's what I would have done."
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.360]   The interesting thing about that reply, I think,
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.960]   is that it would have avoided a lot of the political fallout,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:46.280]   people who were angry that the government bailed out Wall Street and not Main Street.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.760]   Something else we chatted about briefly last night,
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:58.680]   Jack, is obviously we live in a world now that it's a DC world.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.480]   It's a defined contribution world.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.880]   The BP pensions, the old traditional pensions are slowly going away.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.160]   Was the shift from DB to DC,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.880]   defined benefit pension plans,
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.600]   traditional pension plans to defined contribution plans a mistake?
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:24.440]   Well, it's not a mistake conceptually because that's the way the world is going.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.840]   Corporations want that pressure off their P&Ls.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.000]   But it's given us a system that is not working well at all.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.560]   It's moved the whole shift of risk from the corporation,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.160]   which can handle it presumably,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.400]   over to the investor, most of whom cannot handle the risk.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:47.360]   We tried to turn a savings plan,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.520]   a trip plan into a retirement plan.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.360]   If you have a retirement plan,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.400]   I've written a lot about this,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.840]   talked about it down at the Senate testimony.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.600]   You can't take money out of your retirement plan whenever you want.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   You can't borrow from it.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   Think of what would happen to Social Security if you could
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.720]   do all those things. You wouldn't be working for anybody.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.440]   The wife needs a new rug,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.840]   there goes your retirement. Too bad.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:19.880]   So it's basically the defined contribution system is what we're faced with,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.080]   what's going to grow.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.240]   I can even see the states and municipalities going from defined benefit.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.200]   The governments, state-level governments are the biggest,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.120]   by far the biggest defined benefit plans.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.840]   They're going to eventually, I think,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.720]   go to, well, the labor unions there are so strong.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.400]   That's going to be a hard thing to do,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.040]   but the economics fit that.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.080]   We've got to make a much better defined contribution.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.320]   Very difficult to withdraw.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.000]   Only allow low-cost funds into the system,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.800]   maybe even only index funds.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.560]   Easy for me to say,
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.360]   but the fact of the matter is,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.480]   all these defined contribution beneficiaries together,
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.880]   I think it's around five trillion dollars worth,
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.960]   own the stock market as a group.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.160]   But they're trading with each other back and forth,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.920]   buying this fund and that fund and selling others.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.680]   They're not going to do nearly as well at paying high costs.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.520]   So we have to have those kind of elements in the system,
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.280]   and we have to have more mandatory contribution rate.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.880]   Right now, a corporation can just come out and say,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.320]   "I'm not going to pay you anything this year."
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.760]   That's usually, by the way,
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.280]   the values in the market are the best they're going to be in a long time.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.240]   Because they do this when markets are low,
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.080]   and because that's business as well.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.960]   So it's a lot of fixing.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.320]   While I will say this, I'll tell you a little anecdote.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:43.040]   I was doing, that was a 60-year legacy party seminar for a day,
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.960]   in the Museum of Finance in New York about a year and a half ago.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.480]   I did an interview with Paul Volcker at lunch,
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.200]   and it was a television journalist,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.380]   I can't remember who it was, who interviewed us.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.040]   She asked me what I thought about Social Security,
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.200]   and I'd say the same thing about the fine benefit, fine contribution plan.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.280]   I said, "Look, it's got to be fixed,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.960]   and the fixes are simple.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.040]   It would barely be noticed,
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.600]   maybe not for a long time,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   maybe not forever, small changes in cost of living adjustments,
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.320]   small change in retirement age,
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.380]   a higher minimum deduction, salary cap,
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.020]   115,000, maybe 135,000 or something,
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.220]   which we did only very few people.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:37.540]   I said, "If you would make all of these czars of the Social Security plan,
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.580]   I would say czars of the fine contribution plan too.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.780]   We'd fix it in an hour."
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.300]   Paul said, "Couldn't we fix everything?"
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.960]   I think we probably could,
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.080]   or at least maybe we could.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.760]   I want to turn the tables on you a minute,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.440]   Bill, because I've got a couple of questions for you.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.080]   I was hoping you would wait after that.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.520]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.720]   The line of my questioning comes,
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.800]   it has to do with the markets.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.640]   That is, we can all look at Schiller PEs and regular PEs,
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.280]   and we can always look ahead to earnings,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.860]   which I'm quite confident are quite forced,
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.980]   and then we'll do, I'll talk a little bit about that later on.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.300]   But I was inspired if you're thinking about
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:29.140]   staggering risks that we see out there in the world today,
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.460]   that the market seems to totally ignore.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.940]   You've got this terrorism going on in the Middle East,
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.380]   and the Middle East is more unstable than it's ever been.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:41.460]   I think even more unstable than Lawrence of Arabia for that matter.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.540]   But for a long time in Chinese society,
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.520]   that very religious, in the name of religion,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.860]   big crimes are being committed.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.820]   This awful thing where someone being beheaded is
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.300]   somehow a worse thing than someone being shot in the head.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.620]   I'm not sure the victim cares that much,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.060]   but that's frightening.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.340]   Increasing intransigence of China,
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.220]   and the slowing of growth in China,
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.780]   and there's slowing of growth in China.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.380]   Another problem, Ebola doesn't look like a big problem,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.960]   because it doesn't seem to be able to be transmitted like that.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.980]   I guess we had the bird flu a few years back,
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.540]   which was really a dangerous thing,
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.020]   because it got everywhere.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.700]   But disease, unprecedented, unpredictable things.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.260]   The weakness in the European economy,
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.220]   particularly important in the global world.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.620]   So there are all kinds of huge risks out there that the market,
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.100]   it seems to be ignoring as far as I can tell.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.380]   So my question to you,
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.860]   what I did was that when I thought about this,
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.400]   what could I ask Bill?
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.580]   I didn't realize he was going to take all my time asking me,
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.700]   was I got out a copy of his book called The Investor's Manifesto.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.460]   It says, "Preparing for prosperity,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.420]   Armageddon, and everything in between."
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.500]   So I immediately went to the index and looked up Armageddon.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:12.980]   It wasn't there. So I thought Bill could tell me what's going to happen.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.380]   What I'm describing is almost an Armageddon.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.500]   All these risks converge,
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.620]   almost an Armageddon scenario.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.380]   So what do you say about Armageddon?
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.100]   >> Well, first of all,
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.140]   that word, the subtitle is all Bill Fulton's fault.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.980]   >> I finally figured it out when I found it in the index.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.900]   He said, "How does it sound?"
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.060]   Bill and I said, "Sure."
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.100]   It sounds good to me, whatever sounds.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:51.740]   But more seriously, I think that human beings are prisoners of saliency.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:58.900]   The image of someone having their head cut off,
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.060]   the mental image of something bleeding out from their urethras,
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.340]   from a horrible disease that you really can't treat.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.820]   Those are things that really get our attention.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:16.780]   But I think if you were to go back into a time machine to say 70 years ago,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.140]   when we were staring down the likes of Hitler and Stalin,
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.460]   or even 50 years ago,
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.780]   when one man really saved the world from being incinerated,
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:34.060]   it was a man by the name of Vassily Arkhipov who was a commissar on a submarine
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:40.220]   who prevented his commanders from pressing a nuclear button on that submarine.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.860]   It's a thing you should look up.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.140]   It's an interesting story.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.460]   I think if you went back and you told people 50 or 70 years ago,
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:54.300]   the biggest threat we have now is from people who want to go back to the 7th century
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.220]   and can't even manufacture their own bicycles.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.420]   I think they would have laughed at us.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:06.860]   I think the problems that we're facing now are trivial compared to those problems.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.220]   And I think that's one of the reasons why expected returns,
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:14.260]   why prices are so high and why expected returns are lower.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.500]   Now the other reason why that's the case and has nothing to do with risk
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.780]   is simply the fact that there's a lot more capital in the world.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.940]   And this is a complex subject,
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.340]   but if you go back 5,000 years, nobody had capital.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.100]   We're talking about subsistence level societies.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.740]   And the people needed capital.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.180]   They needed to buy farm implements and buy seed.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:44.300]   So that one person who had capital could get an enormous price for it.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.660]   And as societies become wealthier, that physics, if you will, changes.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.460]   So the richer a society becomes, the lower the returns.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.420]   And maybe the returns we're going to get really aren't commensurate with the risks.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.980]   I think that's right.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.100]   I think the problem is not that risks are so high.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.860]   I don't think they are high compared to the world 50 or 70 or 80 years ago.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:11.900]   I just think that the returns are so low commensurate with the relatively small risks that we have.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.700]   You know, that's something that I was going to ask you about,
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.100]   but I'll comment upon and maybe get a response from you, Jack,
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.180]   which is that, and I'm sure you'll talk about this more later on this morning,
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:31.940]   is if you look at the expected return of a prudent mixed portfolio, a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.140]   it's lower than it's ever been in human history.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.660]   You know, zero return on bonds, maybe a 3% or 4% return on stocks.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:46.460]   That's not much more than 2% real return on your capital.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:53.020]   And that, I think, is really the worrisome thing for people who want to retire.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.340]   You've got this squeeze, if you will, between lower returns,
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.780]   and then people are going to be living longer.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.300]   I've been looking at some of the younger people in this audience,
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.100]   and you know, you're going to live to be 100.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.900]   If you want to retire at age 55, you'd better--
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.220]   What do you mean only the younger people are going to live to be 100?
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.340]   I've been talking to a cop for this for six.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.500]   They're going to have a better chance than I do, that's for sure.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.380]   And you know, if they want to retire at age 55,
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:29.500]   well, maybe people in this room will do it, but not many other people will.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.540]   Well, the interesting thing is that we see whatever it is we see,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.980]   I have to be really concerned about the state of the world today.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.180]   And I don't quite, myself, know what to do about it.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.380]   I mean, I could go heavily into cash, as always, you know,
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.740]   roughly in this day and age, probably 60 percent stock, 65,
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.300]   something like that, counting all the different accounts I have.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.220]   My retirement plan would be higher, that's my biggest asset.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   And my personal account would be lower.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.540]   But personal account is mostly intermediate-term munis.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.220]   So I'm happy to be there, as happy as I could be this year.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.020]   As I've ever been, you know, 8 percent return,
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.180]   most of which is tax-free, is not to be seized at.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:15.700]   So, but I still puzzle that the big risks are undefined and out there somewhere.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:22.340]   And that kind of a situation basically doesn't get a response from the stock market.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.940]   And whether it should or not,
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.700]   I mean, I happen to know one particular investment advisor who has all his clients,
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.460]   has had for years, 60 percent short-term treasures.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.100]   And he says he knows the event is coming,
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.100]   he's got to be ready, he's got to protect our assets,
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.340]   that they have to give up a few gains or a lot of gains in
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:49.660]   the search for protection when the great day or the bad day or the evil day comes.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.460]   Well, that's the way it is.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.940]   Now, I'm not sure that's a viable strategy.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.500]   I think his clients would get a little wondering if he knows what he's doing.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.340]   But if you're ahead of the crowd,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.420]   people are always going to wonder what you're doing.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.980]   So, I don't have any answers to it either,
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.340]   but I do think that everybody in the room,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:14.460]   I would feel very guilty if I didn't warn everybody that this is a risky,
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.220]   risky world we live in.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:22.140]   And I don't know what to do about it except a reasonable conservative position.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.460]   And Armageddon is, I tell people,
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:32.740]   if Armageddon is having some kind of a foreign object strike the US,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.740]   well, it won't matter whether you're in stocks or bonds.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.020]   That's the good news.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.300]   Or to put a little top on that,
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.220]   I reviewed this in a different context earlier.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.140]   We all know the world is going to hell in a handbasket,
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.260]   but it never quite gets there.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.940]   Never quite gets there.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.620]   So, I think you should be aware of risk.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.860]   I don't know what to tell you to do about it.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.820]   I don't know what to tell myself to do about it.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.460]   When I start to panic,
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.020]   I would just read one of my books.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.300]   [laughter]
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.900]   Thanks, Jack and thanks, Bill.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.980]   And we're going to take a short break now.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.580]   And in 20 minutes, Jack will start his comments.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:20.700]   [applause]
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.700]   [silence]
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:35.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
