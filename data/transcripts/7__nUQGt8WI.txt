[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   There's really nothing else to say except take your Bible and turn with me to the book
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.200]   of Revelation, Revelation chapter 19.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.320]   I want to speak to you on the triumph of the King.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:33.160]   Revelation chapter 19, I want to begin reading in verse 11, and we'll look at through verse
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.920]   16.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:48.700]   "And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:58.580]   And he who sat on it is called faithful and true.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:08.040]   And in righteousness he judges and makes war.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.360]   His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.620]   And he has a name written on him which no one knows except himself.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:39.740]   He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:51.180]   And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, are following
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.540]   him on white horses.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:07.820]   From his mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it he may strike down the nations.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.960]   And he will rule them with a rod of iron.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:25.640]   And he treads the winepress of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:43.020]   And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords."
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.460]   In these verses, we see the return of Jesus Christ and the cataclysmic judgment He will
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:59.780]   unleash upon this world with all the fury that belongs to Him.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.560]   This day of devastation is looming on the horizon, and we have never been so close to
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.280]   this final day as we are this very moment.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.420]   It is fast approaching, faster than any of us realize here today.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.820]   Jesus is returning to take back the planet.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.420]   He is coming back to take back that which is rightfully His.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.060]   And He will not be a meek and lowly Jesus who is coming.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:55.580]   Instead, it will be an angry and avenging Jesus coming to wage war with those who have
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.020]   lived in open rebellion against Him.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.660]   And none will escape the devastation of His judgment in that day.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.660]   This planet is spinning through space and is on a collision course with judgment from
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.620]   this Christ.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.340]   And it is inescapable how different it will be in that day when compared to the first
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.220]   time He came.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:39.340]   This time He will not be riding a lowly donkey, but He will be riding a white stallion.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.720]   This time He will not be wearing a crown of thorns, but He will be wearing many diadems.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.860]   This time He will not lay down His life for many.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.700]   Instead, He will take the lives of many.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.260]   And this time He will not be struck across His face with fists, but He will smite the
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.180]   nations with an iron fist.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.780]   How different it will be in that day when Jesus Christ comes back.
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:27.860]   The prophet Isaiah saw this day coming when the divine warrior will burst onto the scene.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:38.780]   Isaiah 59, verse 15, "Now the Lord saw," meaning He saw the world scene at the end of the age.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:50.560]   The Lord saw, and it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.540]   So He put on righteousness like a breastplate.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.120]   And He put on a helmet of salvation on His head.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.040]   And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:17.740]   And He wrapped Himself, Isaiah records, with zeal like a mantle according to their deeds,
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:27.480]   so He will repay wrath to His adversaries and recompense to His enemies.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:39.180]   The Lord Himself will put on the full armor of God, and He will come back in battle attire.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:48.360]   And He will shed the blood of His enemies and then stuff them into hell.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:56.660]   In these verses, the apostle John captures for us the triumph of the King, the one who
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.700]   will have the last word of human history, the one who will bring it all together to
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.260]   its consummation.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:12.900]   Martin Luther said, "I only have two days on my calendar, today and that day."
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:22.020]   You need to have that day on your calendar because this day is coming.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:31.180]   So I want us to walk through this passage, and I want us to take note of what that day
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.340]   will be like.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:40.720]   I want you to note first, in verse 11, the appearing of Christ.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.820]   When Jesus returns, as we will see here in verse 11, it will not be to offer an olive
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.020]   branch.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.060]   It will not be to make a peace settlement.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.860]   It will not be to negotiate with His enemies.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.980]   It will not be to give a second chance.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:11.860]   He will come back, and He will wage war, and there will be no survivors.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.300]   Verse 11 we read, "And I saw heaven opened."
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.520]   It's not the first time we've seen this in the book of Revelation.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:26.220]   Earlier in chapter 4, verse 1, John saw a door open in heaven, and a voice said, "Come
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.220]   up here."
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.460]   And John is catapulted out of his body in this vision into the inner courts of heaven,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:40.660]   and he sees the throne of God and Him who sat upon it.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:53.260]   In that sense, the door was open to let John in, but now heaven is open to let Jesus out.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:02.460]   I saw heaven opened, "Behold," meaning see this, gaze at this, do not blink your eyes,
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.900]   capture this in your mind, "Behold, a white horse."
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:17.420]   A conquering Roman general would return from the battlefield victorious, and he would come
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:26.220]   marching back into Rome on top of this white horse, and it would be the triumph procession,
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.700]   and behind him would be his generals, and behind him would be his soldiers, his foot
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.500]   soldiers, and behind him would be the spoils of victory that they had taken from nations
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:43.700]   that were conquered, and then the defeated foes would be chained to chariots and drugged
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:53.580]   through the streets as the Roman general would return back to Rome.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:08.900]   John sees Jesus on a white horse, not in order to come back from battle, but just the opposite,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.220]   to head into battle.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:25.880]   And he who sat on it, Jesus, the divine warrior, he who sat on it is called faithful and true.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:33.620]   Faithful here meaning trustworthy or reliable, a man of his word, and he is faithful to his
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.300]   promise to wage war.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:47.820]   He is faithful to his promise to fight all unrighteousness and to defeat all ungodliness.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:55.500]   These promises that have been made throughout the pages of Scripture were no idle threats.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.340]   They were no bluffs.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:06.820]   Jesus now will be the executor of divine judgment on this entire planet.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:13.060]   He is faithful to keep these threatening words.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:21.820]   Psalm 96, verse 13, "The Lord is coming to judge the earth.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.540]   He will judge the earth in righteousness."
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:33.920]   And in Psalm 98, verse 9, "The Lord is coming to judge the earth.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.720]   He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity."
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.980]   There will not be one drop of mercy in that day.
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.540]   There will be no patience, no compassion, no love.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:55.380]   It will be sheer, unvarnished righteousness and equity in that day.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:01.600]   Joel chapter 2, verse 1, "Blow a trumpet in Zion.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.880]   Sound an alarm on my holy mountain.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:12.920]   Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:19.960]   Surely it is near, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:29.200]   There has never been anything like it, nor will there be again after it."
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.680]   Oh, there was an initial fulfillment in the day of Joel, but this points to the end, to
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.800]   the ultimate fulfillment, the coming of the day of the Lord, which will be consummated
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:49.480]   in the return of Jesus Christ as He comes now to enter into battle with His enemies.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:56.040]   His name is faithful, and it is true.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.400]   The word "true" means authentic, genuine, real.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:10.320]   No, He is the real executor and avenger of the honor of His Father.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.680]   And He is coming, verse 11 says, "in righteousness."
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:20.480]   The word "righteousness" means inflexible justice.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.440]   It means unbending equity.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   It means an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.780]   So much sin, so much punishment.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.880]   It will be all justice and no mercy in that day.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:43.680]   And He will come and unleash the full fury of His vengeance upon this sin-sick world
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:54.320]   of reprobates, and in righteousness He judges.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:01.000]   The word "judges" means to separate, to separate the wheat from the tares, to separate the
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.560]   vile from the pure, and to render judgment and condemnation upon sinners.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:20.760]   In this day, no living unbeliever will escape this day of judgment.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   Mark it down.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   No sin committed in the history of the world will go unpunished by this divine warrior.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.960]   No sin will ever be swept under the carpet.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.320]   No sin will ever be hidden in a corner.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.920]   Every sin in the history of the world will be brought out.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:53.520]   And every sin will either be punished in hell or punished in Christ upon the cross.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:04.400]   But not one sin will escape the full curse of the law.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:17.920]   In righteousness, He judges, verse 11, and wages war.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:26.880]   Because war is one word in the original, and it means to fight violently with the intent
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.520]   to inflict great harm and destruction.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:41.100]   It means to enter into battle and to fight to the end.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:48.400]   This is not a happy Jesus who's coming back.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   This is an angry Jesus.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:59.200]   I'm sure you've seen the advertising campaign, "He Gets Us."
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Oh, He's going to get us.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.320]   He's going to shish-kebab us.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:20.840]   It presents some liberal, woke Jesus, another Jesus.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   Listen, either Jesus redeems us and reconciles us and forgives us and saves us, or He judges
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.080]   us and condemns us and damns us and torments us.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.160]   There is no other option.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:45.000]   If He does not save you, He will slaughter you.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.160]   This is the appearing of Christ.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:58.960]   And this world has never seen anything like the holocaust that is looming on the horizon
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.240]   that will be executed by this Christ.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.480]   Second, I want you to see the authority of Jesus.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:15.400]   In verse 12, as Jesus returns, He sees the world seen perfectly for what it is.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.160]   He doesn't misinterpret what's going on here on the planet.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.720]   He doesn't miss anything.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.600]   He sees everything perfectly for what it is.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.640]   Nothing goes unnoticed or unseen by Jesus.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.920]   In verse 12, His eyes are a flame of fire.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:45.800]   They're like two blazing torches that are flashing forth from His head, burning through
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:53.080]   every external facade, not just seeing into everyone and into every situation, but actually
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:05.480]   seeing through with x-ray vision, all sin exposed.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.440]   Hebrews 4 verse 13 says, "All things are open and laid bare before the eyes of Him
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.880]   with whom we have to do."
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:30.720]   And on His head are many diadems, many meaning great number, not a couple, not a few.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:36.640]   Diadems just stacked up to the heights of heaven upon His head.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.960]   Diadem is a symbol of absolute sovereignty.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:47.280]   These are not stephanoses that would be given to the victor of an athletic contest.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:57.380]   No, these are diadems that would rest upon the head of a sovereign king.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:06.480]   But please note it says "many diadems," just stacked up one on top of another.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.680]   This indicates unlimited sovereignty.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.720]   A unilateral sovereignty, unimaginable sovereignty.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:25.120]   There can be no successful resistance against this king.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:37.040]   Matthew 28 verse 18, Jesus said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and earth."
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.320]   There is no authority but the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ as it has been handed
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.500]   to Him by the Father, and He now becomes the mediator of the Father's sovereignty over
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.000]   all the created order.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.820]   The word "authority," exousia, means "out of self."
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.800]   He is dependent upon nothing or no one outside of Himself, and everyone and everything is
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.920]   dependent upon Him.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:11.860]   And within Himself, He has the freedom to choose to speak and to act as He pleases.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:18.200]   He has the right to do whatsoever He so chooses.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   It says "all authority."
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.060]   Even authorities that governments have is a delegated authority that has come from the
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.300]   one who has all authority.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.240]   Even the authority of a parent over a child has come from the one who has all authority
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.320]   in heaven and earth.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:50.680]   It is unrestricted exercise of His will, total and complete dominance over everyone and everything
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.200]   in every place.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:00.280]   There is no place that is outside the jurisdiction of His sovereignty.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:10.300]   This sovereignty extends over believers and unbelievers, as the potter over the clay.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.140]   It is over Satan and demons.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.120]   As Martin Luther once said, "The devil is God's devil."
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.320]   Over circumstances and outcomes, over life and death, over heaven and hell, over world
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.500]   empires and dynasties, over kings and paupers, over big events and small occurrences, over
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:35.560]   human minds and human hearts and human wills, there is no place outside of His authority.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:42.460]   As Abraham Kuyper once said, "There is not one square inch of all creation," but that
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:48.620]   he says, "mine."
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.700]   That's how sovereign he is.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.660]   But it's more than you and I can even comprehend.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.980]   For he goes on to say in verse 2, "And he has a name written on him which no one knows
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.900]   except himself."
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:18.300]   That means he possesses incomprehensible sovereignty, far beyond what you and I can even grasp at
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.420]   this moment.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:29.900]   However sovereign you perceive Jesus Christ to be, it falls woefully short of the reality
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.820]   of what it is.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:40.660]   It is an inconceivable sovereignty that is impossible for any human mind to grasp the
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.540]   full extent of His sovereignty.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:58.460]   Only Jesus Himself and the Father and the Spirit can know how sovereign He is.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.200]   Creation is not run by a democracy.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.460]   It is run by a theocracy.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.100]   This world is not run by democracy.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:18.380]   This world is run by a theocracy, the will of one who towers over all of creation and
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:24.860]   who will bring everything to its appointed end.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:31.620]   Third, see the anger of Jesus.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:45.620]   In verse 13, as Jesus bursts onto the scene, He is filled with holy rage and righteous
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.340]   indignation.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:24:00.920]   Verse 13, He is clothed with a robe, the same robe that Isaiah saw in Isaiah 6, the train
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.580]   of His robe filling the temple.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:19.060]   Here this robe that is worn by Christ in His return is dipped in blood, literally baptized
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:29.800]   in blood, bapto, literally immersed in blood, soaked in blood, drenched in blood, every
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.940]   square inch of it.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.780]   And it's not His own blood.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:47.140]   It is the blood of His enemies, and it pictures the certainty of the coming slaughter upon
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.820]   His arrival.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:56.100]   He's coming back as the killer King.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:05.300]   The Apostle Paul describes this same scene in 2 Thessalonians 1, verse 7.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:16.500]   The Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:23.280]   out retribution to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:30.380]   These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:40.460]   It will be like a ball of fire descending out of heaven and crashing upon this earth
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:50.660]   and then flaming this entire evil world system and every unbeliever.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:26:03.300]   Again, Isaiah saw this day back in Isaiah 63, and verses 1 through 3, in Isaiah 63,
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:10.500]   it's a Q&A, a question, then an answer, a question, and then an answer.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:22.260]   In verse 1, the first question, "Who is this who comes from Eden, whose garments of glowing
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:32.100]   colors with bozrah, this One who is majestic in His apparel, marching in the greatness
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.700]   of His strength?
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:40.020]   Who is this who is approaching this planet?"
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:48.300]   Answer, at the end of verse 1, "Christ Himself speaks.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:58.660]   It is I who speaks in righteousness, mighty to save."
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:12.340]   Verse 2, second question, "Why is your apparel red and your garments like the one who treads
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.660]   in the winepress?
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:20.300]   Why are your robes stained with blood?"
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:26.440]   Answer in verse 3, "Jesus, the Messiah, speaks.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:36.180]   I have trodden the wine trough alone, and from the peoples there was no man with Me."
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:43.500]   I mean, who else could be the executor of judging the entire planet and damning the
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:52.940]   entire planet but this One who's coming whose garments are stained in red?
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.120]   I have trod them in My anger.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.460]   And the word "anger" here in the Hebrew means "the nostril."
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:12.860]   And the idea is the heavy breathing of Christ when He comes back like a snorting bull.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:21.380]   The intensity of His anger that has been building up for these many centuries that will finally
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.900]   be unleashed.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:32.500]   I have trod them in My anger and trampled them in My fury.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:42.780]   And the word "fury" here in the Hebrew means "heated rage," red-hot rage.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:51.060]   And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, and I stained all My raiment.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:58.140]   Verse 4, "For the day of vengeance was in My heart."
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:10.700]   Verse 6, "I trod down the peoples in My anger and made them drunk in My wrath.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:20.860]   And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:27.020]   Never apologize for this Jesus.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:33.780]   There is no dark side to Jesus.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.380]   God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:48.780]   Look at John 1, verse 5, "Never withhold this Christ from your people as you preach."
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:55.300]   Here are sinners in the hands of an angry Christ.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:08.460]   And He is angry beyond human comprehension because He is holy, holy, holy.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:14.500]   Verse 13, "And His name is called the Word of God."
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:22.940]   This means that Jesus is the full expression and perfect revelation of all that God is
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.380]   to mankind.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:30.300]   Colossians 1:15, "He is the image of the invisible God."
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:43.060]   Jesus is the outspokenness of the Father, not only in mercy but in wrath.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:55.540]   The full fury of God's righteous anger will be mediated by the Son in this day.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:06.140]   On this day, it will be the dam break of divine vengeance upon this world.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:16.860]   Jonathan Edwards in that sermon, "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," 1741 Enfield,
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:25.860]   among the many images that he used, he used the image of a river of wrath that is flowing
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:32.300]   out of heaven to unbelievers in this world.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:43.340]   And right now, this river of wrath, eternal wrath, is being dammed up by His mercy.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:49.860]   And it is being held back by His grace.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:32:00.820]   But the longer this river of wrath is flowing and it is being dammed up, it is intensifying
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.540]   in the force of the flow of the wrath.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:11.220]   And Edwards said there is a day coming when God will remove the dam of His mercy, and
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:20.300]   this pent-up wrath of God in full measure will literally devour mankind and this planet
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:25.340]   on this day.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:33.580]   His name is called the Word of God.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:43.460]   He is the perfect revelation and the full manifestation of the wrath of God upon this
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.140]   planet.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:54.060]   You and I are living on a doomed planet.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:07.940]   Fourth, in verse 14, the armies of Jesus.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:15.780]   Jesus does not return alone, but with myriads of myriads, which means ten thousands of ten
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:23.820]   thousands, and thousands of thousands surrounding Him.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:32.100]   What a display of power and strength and authority this is, with all of the redeemed of all of
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:38.860]   the ages galloping behind this One who sits on a white horse.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:46.340]   Verse 14, "And the armies which are in heaven," please note "armies" plural, "vast numbers
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:53.340]   in His armies, all under Christ's command."
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:34:01.740]   These are the glorified saints down through the ages, and here is the church triumphant,
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.420]   and the church militant.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:13.060]   And they are clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:22.860]   We know earlier from verse 8 that they are retired in their righteous deeds.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:35.300]   And they were following Him on white horses, ready for battle, coming for victory, stampeding
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:43.060]   onto the scene of human history, coming behind their general, the captain of the Lord of
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:48.460]   hosts, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:57.380]   They serve at His beckoning call, and this one day will be you and me, here all the saints
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:06.420]   from all of the ages, dressed in battle attire and full military dress.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:13.780]   And in the battles of this world, the foot soldiers go first, and the general comes in
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.820]   behind for safety and protection.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.820]   But in this day, it will be the total opposite.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:28.100]   It will be the general who will lead the troops into battle, and these armies will not even
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:37.860]   lift a finger to fight, because the King will do the fighting, and the King will win the
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:45.340]   battle by Himself.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:50.460]   In verse 15, we see the attack of Christ.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:57.500]   I mean, Jesus does more than just show up.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.820]   He comes in full attack mode.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:12.940]   And in verse 15, there are three images, all drawn from the Old Testament, and one built
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.980]   on the next, built on the next.
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:24.900]   It is a terrifying sight of horrific judgment.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:35.940]   In verse 15, the first image is a sharp sword.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:42.580]   From His mouth comes a sharp sword.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:49.180]   This word for "sword" is the long, broad sword.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:53.780]   John Knox had one to protect George Hwysart when he was his assistant in the preaching
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.060]   ministry in Scotland.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.460]   It's a long, broad sword.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.060]   It's not a little pocketknife.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:08.340]   And from His mouth, from what He says, comes a sharp sword.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.060]   It is an instrument of warfare.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:17.380]   It is an instrument used to slay and kill one's enemies.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:24.660]   Remember in John 18, verses 5 through 8, when Jesus is in the garden, and Judas leads the
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:31.180]   cohort of Roman soldiers and the Jewish leaders to the garden of Gethsemane, and He says,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.180]   "Whom do you look for?"
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:37.620]   And He says, or they say, "Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.220]   And Jesus simply says, "I am."
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.820]   "Ego eimi," "I am."
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:53.700]   And just the mere mention of His name, they all fall backwards to the ground.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.780]   Here this is the same, but it'll be 10,000 times 10,000 times 10,000.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:04.860]   When He speaks, it is with a sharp sword.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.620]   Why?
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.380]   Why does He speak this way?
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:21.300]   "So that it," this broad sword, "may smite down the nations."
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:32.220]   The word "smite" means to beat them down into submission, to crush them.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:37.500]   And as it were, with this sharp two-edged sword, to slit the throat of every one of
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:51.580]   His enemies, and then stuff them down into hell, so that He might smite the nations.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.260]   Russia will not get away with it.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.740]   Hamas will not get away with it.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.620]   Iran and Iraq will not get away with it.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.020]   Canada will not get away with it.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.380]   The United States will not get away with it.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.660]   The Democrats will not get away with it.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.740]   The Republicans will not get away with it.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.620]   The abortion clinics will not get away with it.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.220]   The pornography industry will not get away with it.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.940]   Hollywood will not get away with it.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.700]   Disney will not get away with it.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.540]   Washington will not get away with it.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:37.820]   The Republic of California will not get away with it.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:51.980]   He will smite the nations and utterly destroy them, because they are vile in His eyes.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.380]   And then the second metaphor, the second Old Testament allusion in the middle of verse
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:11.760]   15, "And He will rule them," literally, "He will tend to them with a rod of iron," another
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.780]   instrument used to destroy another object and to smash it into so many pieces that it
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.780]   could never be put back together again.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:30.740]   And this imagery is found in Psalm 2, verse 8, as the Father urges the Son, even commands
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:40.820]   the Son, "Ask of Me," the Father says to the Son, "Ask of Me, Son, and I will surely give
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:49.420]   the nations as your inheritance, and the very ends of the earth as your possession."
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.620]   To do what?
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:41:01.780]   Verse 9, the Father commands the Son, "You shall break them with a rod of iron.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:07.580]   You shall shatter them like earthenware."
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:14.060]   The Father commands the Son, who is the Word of God, to be the mediator of His wrath, to
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:22.860]   be unleashed upon all the nations, all the nations, all the nations of the world.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:32.620]   This is a devastating picture that God the Father commands God the Son to destroy and
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:37.480]   damn the nations.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:46.500]   And then there's a third Old Testament reference, there's a third image, and He, the Messiah,
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:42:05.260]   the returning divine warrior, treads the winepress of the fierce wrath of God the Almighty.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.400]   He treads the winepress.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.840]   He tramples down underfoot.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:19.600]   The imagery is from ancient times when grapes would be gathered from the vineyard and brought
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:29.460]   to a trough and put into the basin of the trough, and then the farmer would remove his
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:42.960]   shoes and just, with his heel, crush all of the grapes until the juice is just being disseminated
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.820]   like missiles, just being sent out.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.820]   That's the imagery here.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:54.000]   The Father commanding the Son, "With your heel, I want you to crush the nations and
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:04.520]   smash their lifeblood out of them, that they would live no longer on this planet."
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.360]   This image is violent.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:17.760]   It is horrific of Jesus slaughtering the last generation upon this planet.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.800]   This is like a horror movie.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:29.200]   Only 10,000 times more intense and a million times more real.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:36.380]   Listen again to Isaiah 63, verse 3, "I have trodden the Messiah as the Speaker, the Son
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.440]   of God, the suffering servant of Jehovah in Isaiah.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:45.720]   I have trodden the wine trough alone.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:52.520]   And from the peoples, there was no man with me; I trod them in my anger, and trampled
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:44:06.920]   them in my wrath, and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments, and I stained all my raiment."
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:21.120]   And as he does it in verse 15, he does it with the fierce wrath of God.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:29.960]   Those two words joined together, "fierce wrath," that is a deadly combination.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:40.400]   The word "fierce" means blazing hot, like out of a furnace, glowing red and orange,
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:51.880]   burning, flaming, fiery, anger of Christ, and completely under control.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.160]   That's the terror of it.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.720]   He's not flying off the handle.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:05.000]   This is fully measured and rightly disseminated.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.120]   This is not a stoic sovereign.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.680]   This is one who is enraged.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:22.040]   And then the word "wrath," the Greek word "orge," it comes into the English language
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:34.600]   as "orgy," where there are sexual orgies of heavy breathing and intense passion and
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   exaggerated feelings.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:54.800]   Here the fierce wrath is the unleashing of His holy hatred of sinners and of their sin,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:09.320]   being unleashed like an erupting volcano, spewing forth lava upon God-haters and Christ-rejectors.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:21.700]   It's the full fury of God at the time of the second coming of Christ.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:32.160]   And then John records these last two words, "the Almighty."
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.600]   This is more than we can get our arms around.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   This is more than we can wrap our minds around this.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:58.060]   The fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, the One who possesses all power, the One who can
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:14.480]   inflict this devastation without any limitation upon those who are guilty of cosmic treason
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:25.040]   against the King of heaven, the sheer force of His power is unimaginable.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:33.980]   It will make the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima look like a firecracker.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:42.300]   The full force of His wrath will be unleashed.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:49.820]   Jesus is not reluctant to do this.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:48:01.480]   He is commanded by His Father to do this, and as an obedient Son, He carries it out.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:08.040]   Jesus is not acting out of character here.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.120]   This is Jesus.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.340]   This is the real Jesus.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:21.580]   This is the killer King.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:30.980]   Psalm 5, verse 5, "You hate all who do iniquity.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:36.740]   You destroy those who speak falsehood.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:45.460]   The Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit."
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.540]   Did you hear those words?
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:54.780]   "Hate, destroy, abhors."
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:49:04.140]   This is a long way from "Smile, God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life."
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:10.180]   Psalm 7, verse 6, "Arise, O Lord, in your anger."
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:17.900]   Verse 12, "If a man does not repent, he, God, will sharpen his sword.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:23.380]   He has bent his bow and made it ready."
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.980]   The arrow is already in the bow.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.340]   The string is already pulled back.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:36.480]   It is already aimed at the sinner man before this day even comes.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:47.260]   He has prepared for Himself deadly weapons in order to take down those who reject Him.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:51.180]   He makes His arrows fiery shafts.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:58.600]   That means the arrow that's in the bow and the arrow is pulled back and it's taught.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:07.520]   God then dips the arrow into fire and lights the arrow so that when the arrow is shot,
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:16.940]   it plunges into the chest case, the chest of the sinner man and then explodes with fire.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:29.860]   And as Charles Adams Spurgeon says in "Treasury of David," "And God never misses His target."
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:40.660]   This is the Jesus of the Bible who, when He comes back at His second coming, is going
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:55.620]   to be so enraged that He will destroy this planet, those who live in it.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:12.780]   Finally verse 16, the array of Jesus. Jesus is depicted now in verse 16 as wearing a banner
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:22.500]   like sash across His chest that drapes down over His thigh.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:33.540]   Verse 16, "And on His robe," the robe that is drenched in the blood of His enemies, the
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:46.020]   robe that is doused in the blood of His enemies and dripping wet, hangs a banner like a king
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:58.920]   would wear across His chest and on His thigh, meaning it drapes down over His upper leg,
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.580]   and He has a name written.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:11.860]   A name represents the totality of what a person is, His character, His abilities.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:29.140]   He has a name written, "King of kings and Lord of lords."
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:34.380]   He is kinging, kinging over the kings of this world.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:40.180]   He is lording over the lords of this world.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:48.700]   In previous chapters in Revelation, we could read about ten kings coming together to form
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:58.220]   a coalition of global power, and one over them like a beast coming out of the sea, having
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.500]   the authority to control the world's economy, and there could be no buying and no selling
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.900]   apart from being a part of the system.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:14.780]   And these kings will rise to power in the last days and will dominate the world such
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:26.280]   that you cannot even buy or sell or eat or drink without being a part of the system.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:35.020]   And when Christ comes back, He will remove every one of those kings, and He will remove
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:42.660]   every prince and every judge and every lord and every prime minister, and He will be the
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:48.260]   judge of judges.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:53.580]   He alone will be king in that day.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.380]   There will be no other kings.
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:01.100]   There will be no other lords.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:07.780]   Every other king will be immediately subjected to His sovereignty, and every world ruler
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:13.140]   is removed from office and removed from His throne.
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.020]   Biden is gone.
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.780]   Putin is gone.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.300]   Pelosi is gone.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.800]   Newsom is gone.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.820]   Trump is gone.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:34.220]   Christ alone is enthroned.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.460]   This is the triumph of truth.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:43.300]   This day is coming.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:53.780]   I don't see how anyone can read their Bible and not give serious thought to how close
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:59.020]   we are to this day.
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:08.540]   You would have to be like an ostrich with your head in the ground and live in a cave
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:16.220]   not to be able to see the signs of the times in which we live.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:25.540]   I have no idea where we are on God's calendar, and that's the surest sign He may return soon.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:32.300]   For in such an hour, as you know not, the Son of Man will return.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.620]   This is the divine warrior.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:42.420]   The Lord Jesus Christ Himself who's coming.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:47.520]   He's not coming to save, but to slaughter.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:54.500]   He's not coming to deliver, but to destroy and to damn.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.820]   There is grace and there is mercy today, but in that day there will be no grace and there
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.820]   will be no mercy.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:13.060]   In that day, truth will triumph over the devil's lies and over this world's ideologies.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:18.420]   In that day, the truth of God will be the only voice that will be heard.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:27.500]   In that day, Jesus who is the truth will speak with the sound of many waters and drown out
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:34.680]   every other voice, and He alone will be heard.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:43.100]   This is the triumph of truth at the end of the age because it is the triumph of the King
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.260]   Himself.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:53.460]   I must ask you, do you know this King?
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:57:01.260]   Have you come to see that your only hope of escaping the eternal wrath of God is to flee
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:08.380]   to Christ who came into this world on a mission of salvation, to live a sinless and perfect
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:14.900]   life, to fulfill all righteousness, and to go to a cross to be lifted up, and to bear
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:20.780]   the sins of His people, and there upon the cross that Jesus Christ would make the only
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:25.700]   atonement for sin?
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:31.300]   There through the shedding of His blood, there is forgiveness of sin, and it is being freely
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:39.900]   offered to you this very moment, and if you reject it, you have no one to blame but yourself.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:45.780]   If you were to die today and you stood before God, where would you be?
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.900]   Where would you end up?
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:55.500]   Either heaven or hell, and the only way to be in heaven and to escape all that we see
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:58:02.620]   here, and this is only the warm-up for eternal hell.
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:09.060]   Eternal hell will go on throughout all the ages to come, the lake of fire and brimstone,
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:14.260]   the place where the worm never dies, where there is the weeping and the gnashing of teeth,
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:23.620]   that place of outer darkness, that place of torment, where there is no relief for the
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.540]   soul ever.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:31.140]   Come to Christ.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:34.100]   He's the friend of sinners today.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.460]   He will receive sinners today.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:44.500]   Do not wait till the last day and face this Christ, who is the angry Christ.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.060]   Believe in Christ today.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.920]   Repent of your sin.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:57.620]   Take that step of faith and entrust your soul to Him, and you will find mercy.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.300]   You will find forgiveness for all of your sins.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.100]   There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:08.740]   If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.780]   us from all unrighteousness.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:16.760]   Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   Christ.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:21.780]   For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.140]   of God, lest any man should boast.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.660]   Today is a day of opportunity for you.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.060]   It is a day of mercy for you.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:38.540]   It is being extended to you from the King.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.820]   Humble yourself.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.620]   Deny yourself.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:49.260]   Take up a cross and become a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:56.700]   Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:02.460]   destruction and many are those who find it, the gate is small and the way is narrow that
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:07.660]   leads to life, and few are those who find it.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:14.180]   Jesus says, "He who hears these words of mine and acts upon them is like a very wise man
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:18.740]   who built his house upon the rock, and when the rains came and the winds blew and beat
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.660]   against the house, it did not fall, because it was built on the rock.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:31.540]   He who hears these words of mine and does not act upon them is like a very foolish man
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:37.020]   who built his house upon the sand, and when the rains came and the winds blew and beat
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:46.260]   against the house, great was its fall, because it was built upon the sand."
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:59.120]   That storm of which Jesus spoke in those verses, it's a gathering storm tonight on the horizon,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:08.720]   and you have opportunity this day to escape that storm and build upon the rock of Jesus
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.680]   Christ.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:22.020]   There is no other place to stand to escape His wrath.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:38.060]   Father, we believe this, and this causes us to shudder.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.420]   It causes us to tremble.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.940]   How could we be unaffected by this?
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:02:00.340]   I pray that You would use this passage to stir our hearts, to bow before You, and to
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:10.340]   praise Your name for those of us who are in Christ, that we will escape this horrific
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.700]   day.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:19.340]   I pray that You would increase the sense of urgency within us to reach this world for
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.980]   Christ before it's too long.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:31.540]   You have already once submerged this entire planet in the great flood of Noah's day,
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:36.780]   and only eight survived.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:44.180]   You're about to do it again, but not with water, but with fire.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:56.340]   Lord, may we preach the gospel and send forth the good news of salvation while there's time,
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:04.260]   because there's also bad news looming on the horizon.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:10.100]   Bless everyone who is here today with the truth of Your Word.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:17.380]   Use it to affect us in a mighty way, in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   Amen.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   Amen.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:28.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
