[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.600]   Today, my guest is Dr. Justin Sonnenberg.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.840]   Dr. Sonnenberg is a professor of microbiology and immunology
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.480]   and one of the world's leading experts
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.400]   on the gut microbiome.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000]   The gut microbiome is the existence
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.680]   of trillions of little microorganisms throughout your gut.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.200]   And by your gut, I don't just mean your stomach,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.560]   I mean your entire digestive tract.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.000]   Turns out we also have a microbiome that exists in our nose,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.040]   in any other location in which our body interfaces
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.680]   with the outside world.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400]   In fact, there's a microbiome on your skin.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000]   And while it might seem kind of intrusive
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.120]   or kind of disgusting to have all these little microorganisms
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420]   they can be immensely beneficial for our health,
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080]   meaning our hormonal health, our brain health,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.840]   and our immune system function.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.460]   Dr. Sonnenberg teaches us about the gut microbiome,
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.960]   how it's organized spatially,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.780]   meaning which microbiota live where.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780]   He teaches us about these incredible things
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.360]   called crypts and niches,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.200]   which are little caves within our digestive tract
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.440]   that certain microbiota take residence.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   And at that premier real estate,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.000]   they're able to do incredible things to support our health.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.020]   He also talks about the things that we can all do
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.540]   to support our microbiome in order for our microbiome
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.360]   to support our brain and body health.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   Dr. Sonnenberg co-runs his laboratory with his spouse,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.280]   Dr. Erika Sonnenberg,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.640]   and together they've also written a terrific
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.920]   and highly informative book called "The Good Gut,"
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.640]   taking control of your weight, your mood,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.160]   and your long-term health.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160]   Even though that book was written a few years back,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.680]   the information still holds up very nicely.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.560]   And today he also builds on that information,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.360]   informing us about recent studies that for instance,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.280]   point to the important role of fermented foods
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.160]   and the role of fiber in supporting a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.260]   So if you've heard about the gut microbiome,
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.340]   or even if you haven't,
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.680]   today you're going to hear about it
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.140]   from one of the world's leading experts.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.940]   He makes it immensely clear as to what it is,
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180]   how it functions, and how to support it
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.100]   for your brain and body health.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.280]   During today's discussion,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.100]   we don't just talk about nutrition.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.520]   We also talk about the impact of behaviors and the microbiome,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.960]   behaviors such as who you touch, who you kiss, who you hug,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.920]   whether or not you interact with or avoid animals,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920]   whether or not those animals belong to you,
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.600]   or whether or not they belong to somebody else.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   If all that sounds a little bit bizarre,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.300]   you'll soon understand that your microbiome
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.880]   is constantly being modified by the behavioral interactions,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.320]   the nutritional interactions,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.840]   and indeed your mood and internal reactions
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.660]   to the outside world.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.520]   This is an incredible system.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.920]   Everyone has one.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.200]   Everyone should know how it works,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.100]   and everyone should know how to optimize it.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.300]   And today you're going to learn all of that
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.720]   from Dr. Sonnenberg.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.080]   I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.000]   in May, 2022.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.540]   The first live event will take place
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.360]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.680]   The second event will take place
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.620]   in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.840]   Both are part of a series called the Brain-Body Contract.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.960]   For this series, I will discuss science.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.640]   So I will discuss the mechanistic science
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360]   around things like sleep and focus and motivation,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.860]   physical performance, mental health, physical health,
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.160]   a large number of topics
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.960]   that I believe many people are interested in
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.520]   and that certainly are important
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   for our health and wellbeing and performance.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.380]   In addition, I will, of course,
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.500]   describe tools and actionable items,
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.580]   most of which I have not discussed
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast or anywhere else.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.720]   Presale tickets for these two events go live Tuesday,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.220]   March 8th at 10 a.m. Pacific time.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.400]   We've made these tickets exclusively available
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.220]   to the listeners of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.120]   so they are password protected.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.600]   To find them, you can go to hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.380]   and use the code Huberman.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.120]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.100]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.800]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.600]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.640]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.040]   to the general public.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.120]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.920]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.060]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.440]   I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.200]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.280]   is that it meets all my basic
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.400]   foundational supplementation needs.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   What I mean by that is it covers any vitamin
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240]   and nutritional deficiencies that I might have,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.560]   'cause I'm trying to be good about my nutrition and diet,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.480]   but I don't always manage to get everything that I need,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.760]   and I'm sure that there are a lot of gaps in there.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.900]   So it covers those gaps.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.260]   It also has probiotics.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.080]   And as you'll learn in today's episode,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.920]   and I've talked about on previous episodes,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.820]   the probiotics are essential for a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.420]   We need probiotics in order for our microbiome to thrive,
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.900]   and our microbiome supports things like gut brain health,
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.720]   indeed, things like metabolism, mood, hunger.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.760]   It also supports the immune system.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.400]   So you'll learn today,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.600]   your gut microbiome actually manufactures neurotransmitters,
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.400]   the very chemicals that impact mood and brain function.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.000]   Athletic Greens primes your system
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.200]   for a healthy gut microbiome,
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.420]   something that can be achieved
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.080]   with food and lifestyle factors,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.680]   but is often hard to achieve
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.700]   with just food and lifestyle factors.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.160]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.000]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.340]   to claim a special offer.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.760]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   to make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.180]   while you're on the road,
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.720]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.580]   Vitamin D3 has many important biological functions
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.360]   that support your immediate and long-term health,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.440]   and K2 as well is very important
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.280]   for things like cardiovascular health,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.000]   calcium regulation, and so on.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   Again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.000]   you can claim the special offer
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.360]   of the five free travel packs and the vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.800]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.960]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.640]   that I believe are of the very highest quality.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080]   I've spent my lifetime working
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.840]   on the biology of the visual system,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.960]   and I can tell you that the biology of the visual system
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.200]   has a lot of mechanisms in there,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.120]   so that, for instance,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.000]   if you move from a bright environment to a dim environment,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.740]   your visual system needs to adapt.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.880]   One issue with a lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.900]   is you move from one environment to the next,
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.820]   and you have to take the sunglasses or eyeglasses off.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.680]   You get a glare or you have to adjust
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   because of the way that the lenses are designed.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.460]   With Roka, they've taken the biology
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.880]   of the visual system into account,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.520]   and so you never have to take them off and on
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.820]   in order to move from one environment to the next.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.600]   They are also designed for movement and athletics,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.960]   or you can wear them for just things like work
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.240]   and going out to dinner and so forth.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.280]   They have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.480]   They're extremely lightweight.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.980]   In fact, I often forget that they're even on my face.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.600]   I wear sunglasses when it's very bright
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.780]   and when I'm driving into sunlight, I wear readers at night.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.260]   I hardly ever remember that they're on my face.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.660]   They also won't slip off your face
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.160]   if you use them when running or cycling.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.040]   The company was developed
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.960]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.600]   so everything about these sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.400]   was developed with performance in mind
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.060]   in a lot of different situations and scenarios.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.520]   If you'd like to try Roka, you can go to roka.com,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.320]   that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.280]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.480]   Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.600]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.700]   Helix makes mattresses and pillows
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.480]   that are designed for your particular sleep needs.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.800]   What I mean by that is you can go to the Helix site,
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   you can take a very brief two or three-minute quiz,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.640]   ask questions like, do you sleep on your side,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   your back, your stomach?
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.200]   Do you tend to run hot or cold through the night?
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.840]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.600]   and then they match you to a mattress
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   that's designed for your particular sleep needs.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.400]   I match to the DUSK, D-U-S-K, mattress.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.640]   I like a mattress that's not too firm, not too soft,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.600]   I tend to sleep on my side,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.560]   I serve in the crawling soldier position,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.480]   seems to be the most common position that I sleep in,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.360]   and that really works terrifically well for me.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.640]   But you need to take the quiz
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.560]   to see which mattress works best for you.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.260]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.300]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take the two-minute quiz,
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.360]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   You can figure out how to get your optimal sleep,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.320]   which I've talked about on this podcast
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.200]   so many times before.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.260]   Sleep is the foundation of all mental and physical health
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.540]   and performance in any aspect of life.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.820]   Sleep is key, and the mattress you sleep on
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.540]   is key to the sleep you get.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.580]   After matching you to a customized mattress,
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.540]   you can get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.940]   and two free pillows.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.780]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.140]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.080]   to get up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.660]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.380]   Justin, thanks so much for being here.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.220]   - Great to be here.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.160]   - Yeah.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.800]   I am a true novice when it comes to the microbiome.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.360]   So I'd like to start off with a really basic question,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.960]   which is what is the microbiome?
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.200]   I imagine lots of little bugs running around in my gut,
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.960]   and I don't quite like the image of that,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.000]   but I'm aware that our microbiome can be good for us,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.800]   but we can also have an unhealthy microbiome.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.320]   So if I were to look at the microbiome at the scale
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.960]   that I could see the meaningful things,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.060]   what would it look like and what's going on in there?
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.700]   - Yeah, I mean, essentially you're correct.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.040]   I mean, we have all of these little microorganisms
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.120]   running around in our gut.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.800]   I think, you know, just to start off
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   with clarifying terminology, microbiome and microbiota
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.960]   quite often are referred to,
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.100]   or used to refer to our microbial community interchangeably,
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.880]   and I'll probably switch between those two terms today.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.320]   The other important thing to realize is that these microbes
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.360]   are not just in our gut, but they're all over our body.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.680]   They're in our nose, they're in our mouths,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.000]   they're on our skin.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.660]   And so basically anywhere that the environment can get to
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.280]   in our body, which includes inside our digestive tract,
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.020]   of course, is, you know, colonized with microbes.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   And the vast majority of these are in our distal gut
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.000]   and in our colon, and so this is the gut microbiota
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.520]   or gut microbiome.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.320]   And the density of this community is astounding.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.660]   I mean, it really is.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.920]   If you get down to the scale of, you know,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.200]   being able to see individual microbes,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.800]   you know, you start off with a zoomed out view
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.400]   and you see something that looks like, you know,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   fecal material that digest inside the gut,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.560]   and you zoom in and you start to, you know,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.240]   get to the microscopic level and see the microbes,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.340]   they are just packed, you know, side to side, end to end.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.120]   It's a super dense bacterial community,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.620]   almost like a biofilm, you know,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.660]   something that's just made up of microbes
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.160]   to the point where it's thought that, you know,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.880]   around 30% of fecal matter is microbes, 30 to 50%.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.980]   So, you know, it's an incredibly dense microbial community.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.520]   We're talking of, you know, trillions of microbial cells
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.600]   and all those microbial cells,
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.920]   if you start to get to know them and see who they are,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.140]   break out in the gut probably to hundreds
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.880]   to a thousand species,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.040]   depending upon how you define a microbial species.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.640]   And then most of these are bacteria,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.060]   but there are a lot of other life forms there.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.620]   There are archaea, which are little microbes
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.980]   that are bacteria-like, but they're different.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.260]   There are eukaryotes.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.200]   So, you know, we commonly think of eukaryotes in the gut
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.980]   as, you know, something like a parasite,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.600]   but there are eukaryotes, there are fungi,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.860]   there are also little viruses.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.060]   There are these bacteriophages that infect bacterial cells.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.840]   And so, and those actually outnumber the bacteria
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.020]   like 10 to one.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.080]   So, they're just everywhere there.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.360]   They kill bacteria.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.160]   And so, there's these really interesting
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.000]   predator-prey interactions.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.880]   But overall, it's just this really dense, complex,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.900]   dynamic ecosystem.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.480]   And so, you know, we're talking about the human
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.580]   as a single species, but we're also thinking of the human
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.160]   as this complex, integrated ecosystem
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.680]   of hundreds to thousands of species,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.040]   interacting in concert to do all the fantastic things
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.120]   that we know happen in the human body.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.960]   - Amazing.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.920]   So, we've got a lot of cargo, or maybe we're the cargo.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.640]   - Yeah, I mean, there have been people
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.080]   that have likened humans to just a really elaborate
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.520]   culturing flask for microbes, and that we've actually
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.200]   been designed over the course of evolution,
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.640]   designed to just efficiently propagate
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.360]   this microbial culture from person to person,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.040]   from generation to generation.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   So, it's a different way of thinking of the human body.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.000]   - Interesting.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.400]   I believe that our pH, or the pH of our digestive system
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.080]   varies as you descend, as you go from mouth to, you know,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.520]   to throat and stomach.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.920]   And you said that most of the microbiota
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.780]   are in the distal colon.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.240]   Are there distinct forms of microbiota
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.820]   all along the length of the digestive tract,
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.700]   and within these other interfaces with the outside world?
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.540]   - Totally, yeah.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.880]   So, it starts like with our teeth, and in our mouth,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.660]   and saliva, there's oral microbiota.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.320]   These microbial species are very different
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.700]   than the ones that you find in the digestive tract.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700]   They're usually built to deal with oxygen very well.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.700]   They're in an area that is exposed to a lot of oxygen.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.440]   They, of course, see different nutrients
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.160]   than, for instance, the colonic bacteria would see.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.740]   And they grow quite often in mats that live on teeth.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.840]   So, they're very structured in terms of,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.900]   and not moving around a lot.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.260]   So, they're very fairly stationary.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.860]   As you move down the digestive tract,
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.260]   there are microbes in our esophagus and our stomach,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.660]   but those communities are not very dense,
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.220]   and actually not very well studied.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.500]   We know of a very, you know,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.480]   there's a very famous stomach bacteria
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.500]   known as Helicobacter pylori,
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.980]   which can cause stomach ulcers and cause gastric cancer
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.460]   in some, you know, less frequent situations.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.460]   But, you know, this is a very different set of diseases
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.880]   and different set of microbes.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.660]   They have to be adapted to a different environment
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.920]   in the stomach, especially incredibly acidic environment,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   but also very different in terms of their ability
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.140]   to interact with other microbes,
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.060]   just because the communities are less dense.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.620]   They're less dynamic.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.860]   There's less nutrients that stay there
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.980]   and passage through the community.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.020]   So, a lot of times, those communities are reliant
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.180]   upon nutrients derived from the host
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.480]   as opposed to nutrients derived from our diet.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.180]   As you move down out of the stomach into the small intestine,
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.180]   you start to see these communities,
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.940]   which are the ones that are becoming more well studied.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.140]   Small intestine is still a bit of a black box
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.740]   just because it's hard to access,
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.900]   and so there's some really cool technologies out there
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.260]   for using, for instance, capsules to do sampling
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.020]   as the capsule passes through the digestive tract
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.780]   so that we have a better idea of what's going on
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.060]   in the small intestine.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.800]   And then you get to the colon,
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.900]   and this is the community that's just so incredibly,
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.020]   you know, densely packed, doing a ton of,
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.420]   there's a ton of metabolic activity happening there
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.340]   and a bunch of interaction with the host,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.340]   and that's the community that's really the best studied.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.560]   Part of the reason for that is because stool
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.060]   is so easy to obtain compared to, for instance,
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.140]   something in the stomach or small intestine,
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.120]   and that stool is fairly representative.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.860]   We know from studies that have been done
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.620]   using colonoscopies and so forth,
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.220]   stool is fairly representative
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.120]   of what's happening in the colon.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.700]   So dense, super exciting community,
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.780]   but also the best studied just because it's the easiest
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.380]   to access in the lower digestive tract.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.380]   - Very interesting.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.300]   I imagine these microbiota have to get in there
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.780]   at some point.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.500]   Are microbiota seen in newborns?
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   In other words, where do they come from?
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.580]   And dare I ask, what direction do they enter the body?
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.780]   Or is it from multiple directions?
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.280]   - Yeah, yeah, great question.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.100]   So, you know, one of the burning questions
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.400]   that we can come back to at the end of this
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.120]   is where does our microbiota come from?
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.720]   Because it is this kind of existential question
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.420]   in the field, like where is this community assembling from?
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.980]   And the reason that it's such an interesting question
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.460]   is that a fetus, when it's in the womb,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.840]   that's actually a sterile environment.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.960]   There have been some studies that have looked at
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.920]   whether there are microbes in the womb
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.620]   and microbes colonizing the fetus at that point.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.680]   There's some debate about this,
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.040]   but overall it looks like that's not a big part
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.500]   of the equation of microbial colonization.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.980]   And so each time an infant is born,
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.860]   it's this new ecosystem.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.940]   It's like an island rising up out of the ocean
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.320]   that has no species on it.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.160]   And suddenly there's this like land rush
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.960]   for this open territory.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.560]   And so we know that infants go through
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.420]   this really complex process of microbiota assembly
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.520]   over the first days, weeks, months, years of life.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.760]   And then you get into switching to solid food,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.880]   two to three years of age.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.400]   There are some changes in childhood,
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.580]   adolescents working into adulthood,
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.580]   but that first zero to one year
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.520]   is a super dynamic time with really kind of
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.460]   stereotypical developmental changes in the gut microbiota
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.020]   that appear to have the possibility of going wrong
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   and causing problems for infants in some instances.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.700]   But if you step away from that extreme side
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.140]   of things going wrong,
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.240]   there also are a lot of different trajectories
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.860]   that developmental process can take
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.980]   because our microbiota is so malleable and so plastic.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.840]   And those trajectories can be affected
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.400]   by all sorts of factors in early life.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   So an example is whether an infant is born by C-section
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.920]   or born vaginally.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.040]   We know from beautiful work that's been done in the field
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.240]   that infants that are born by C-section
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.940]   actually have a gut microbiota
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.560]   that looks more like human skin
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.960]   than it does like either the birth canal,
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   the vagina microbiota or the mother's stool microbiota.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.220]   Babies that are born through the birth canal
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.980]   have initial colonization of vaginal microbes
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.220]   and of stool microbes from their mother.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.840]   And so just these first days,
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.200]   whether you're born by C-section
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.520]   or through natural childbirth,
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.100]   your gut microbiota looks very different.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.100]   And then compound on top of that,
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.480]   whether you're breastfed or formula fed,
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   whether your family has a pet or doesn't have a pet,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.060]   whether you're exposed to antibiotics,
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.360]   there are all these factors that really can change
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.760]   that developmental process
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.360]   and really change your microbial identity eventually in life.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   The reason that the field is paying really close attention
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.640]   to this and studying this right now
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.780]   is because we know from animal studies
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.660]   that depending upon the microbes that you get early in life,
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.660]   you can send the immune system or metabolism of an organism
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.140]   or other parts of their biology
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.500]   in totally different developmental trajectory.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.100]   So what microbes you're colonized with early in life
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.500]   can really change your biology.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.780]   And we can come back to that later.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.260]   But getting back to that original question
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.420]   of where do your microbes come from,
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.300]   you'd think because you're born
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.840]   through your mother's birth canal
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.580]   or exposed to her skin microbes,
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.740]   that a lot of your microbes would come from your mother.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.100]   But it actually turns out
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.460]   that we can certainly detect that signal.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.700]   We certainly see maternal microbes in the infant,
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.220]   but there are a lot of microbes
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.640]   that are coming from other places, surfaces, other people,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.260]   perhaps other caregivers, but perhaps strangers as well.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.620]   So we acquire our microbes from a variety of sources.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.500]   The first ones are from our mom
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.640]   or from our caregivers from the hospital,
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.780]   but then we add to that tremendously
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.620]   over the first year or so of life.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.060]   - Incredible, you even said pets.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.940]   So if a kid, if there's a dog in the home
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.660]   or a parakeet in the home,
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.080]   that clearly they have a microbiome also,
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.780]   then potentially the child is deriving microbiota species
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.660]   from those pets, correct?
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.500]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.140]   And so the best studies that have been done
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.880]   have just looked at pets in the household as a factor
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.840]   and whether that changes the group of infants
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.980]   that have a pet to look slightly different
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.500]   than the group of infants that don't have a pet.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.340]   And then the question is,
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.280]   what is the pet doing to change those microbes?
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.940]   And some of it is probably actually contributing
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.120]   to direct members of the microbiota.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.700]   Actually, I have a dog,
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.500]   that dog occasionally will lick my mouth
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.520]   without me like paying attention,
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.160]   and that's probably introducing microbes.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.180]   We also know that pets are down in the dirt,
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.760]   they're outside, they're being exposed
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.720]   to a lot of environmental microbes.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.100]   And so just pets serving as a conduit
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.180]   for a bunch of microbes that we wouldn't otherwise
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.740]   come in contact with is a possibility as well.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.580]   - I'll show you what.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.140]   We will return to pets and in particular, your dog,
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.300]   an amazing dog, by the way.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.260]   I met your dog just the other day
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.460]   and I had to force myself.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.180]   I had to pry myself away from, it's a Havanese, right?
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.020]   - Havanese.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.860]   - Incredible, what is your dog's name?
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.640]   - Louis, Louis Pasteur.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.380]   - Louis Pasteur, I don't know how appropriate.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.920]   Amazing dog, what a personality on that dog.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.440]   The issue that I think a lot of people
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.780]   are probably wondering is what is a healthy microbiome?
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.760]   And what is it supporting?
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.940]   We hear that you need a healthy microbiome
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.880]   to support the immune system or metabolism
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.000]   or even the gut brain access.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.720]   How do we define a healthy versus a unhealthy microbiome?
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.840]   Some people might know the unhealthy microbiome
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.640]   as dysbiosis is the word that I encounter in the literature.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.540]   But given that there are so many species of microbiota
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.640]   and given that I think we probably each have
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.220]   a signature pattern of microbiota,
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.040]   how do we define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota?
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.320]   Is there a test for this?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.360]   Later we'll talk about technologies for testing microbiota.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.040]   There are a lot of companies now,
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.380]   a lot of people sending stool samples in the mail.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.180]   Never look at the postal service the same way again,
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.380]   but it's out there and it's getting analyzed.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.820]   So how should I think about this?
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.880]   I can think about things like heart rate,
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.880]   heart rate variability, BMI, all sorts of metrics of health.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.740]   How should I think about the microbiota?
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.080]   How do I know if my microbiome is healthy or unhealthy?
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.760]   - Yeah, it's a million dollar question right now
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.440]   in the field and there's a lot of different ways
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.340]   of thinking about that and I can talk about some of those.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.340]   But I would say that there are sessions at conferences,
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.280]   there are review articles being commissioned.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.480]   There are all sorts of kind of thought pieces
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.980]   about this right now, like what is a healthy microbiota?
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.260]   What are the features that define it?
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.000]   And I think before diving into this,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   the important thing to realize is it's a complex topic.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.280]   Context matters a lot.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.460]   What's healthy for one person or one population
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.760]   may not be healthy for another person or population.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.580]   And the microbiota is malleable.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   It's plastic, it changes our human biology,
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.720]   which I think is how we think about health quite often,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.360]   BMI and longevity, reproductive success,
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.720]   however you wanna define it.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:04.360]   It certainly can accommodate a variety of configurations
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.040]   of gut microbiota and we don't have,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.960]   it's really hard to untangle all of the different factors
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.000]   of what could be very healthy
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.480]   versus a little bit less healthy.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.720]   So I will say that there's no single answer to this,
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.880]   but there's some really important considerations
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.800]   and perhaps the best way to start talking about this
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.200]   is to go back to the inception
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.680]   of the Human Microbiome Project,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.400]   which was this program that NIH started.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.000]   They invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   for really propelling the field of gut microbiome research.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.800]   It was becoming evident at that point
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.360]   that this was not just a curiosity of human biology,
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.600]   that it was probably really important for our health.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.640]   And they had all this wonderful sequencing technology
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.340]   from the Human Genome Sequencing Project.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.640]   And with the human genome complete at that point,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.160]   they started turning that technology
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.620]   to sequencing our gut microbes.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.880]   And it's important to contextualize
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.520]   the amount of information that they're trying to document.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.120]   The collective genome of our gut microbes
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.460]   is on the order of 100 to 500 times larger
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.040]   than our human genome.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.440]   So it's just in terms of the number of genes.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.040]   So it's just this vast number of genes.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.240]   And then if you start getting
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.720]   into some of the fine variation,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.960]   it's scales by 10 to 100 fold.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.240]   So really a huge amount of information
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   they're trying to document.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.960]   And so it was a wonderful investment
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.920]   and it continues to pay dividends to this day.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.720]   But one of their goals of that project
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.680]   was to try to define what a healthy microbiome is
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.220]   versus a diseased microbiome in different contexts.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.760]   And so they started enrolling a bunch of healthy people
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.120]   and a bunch of people with, for instance,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.480]   inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.200]   And the idea was let's document those microbiomes,
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.400]   what microbes are there, what genes are there.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.860]   And then we can start to get a sense
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.000]   of what are the commonalities of the healthy people
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.860]   and how can that go wrong in these different disease states.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   And there were some answers from that,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.440]   but through those studies,
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.960]   we really started to get the image
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.600]   that there is this tremendous individuality
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.980]   in the gut microbiome.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   And so it's really hard to start drawing conclusions
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.440]   after initial pass of that project
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.600]   of what is a healthy microbiome.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.700]   But the other thing that we started to realize
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.760]   at the same time, there were studies going on
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.440]   documenting the gut microbiome of traditional populations
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.640]   of humans, hunter-gatherers,
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.960]   rural agricultural populations.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.880]   And those studies were really mind blowing
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.920]   from the perspective of all these people are healthy,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.460]   they're living very different lifestyles
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.640]   and their microbiome doesn't look anything
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.560]   like a healthy American microbiome.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.800]   - So does that mean that the healthy American microbiome
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.560]   is healthy, but only in the context of living
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.060]   in the United States and consuming what's consumed here?
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.480]   Or is it that there is a superior microbiome signature
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.880]   somewhere in our history or currently in the world?
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.520]   - Yeah, I think that's kind of a big question right now.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.800]   I think there's a great quote from Dabchansky
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.560]   that says, "Nothing in biology makes sense
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.520]   "except in the light of evolution."
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.440]   And these traditional populations are all modern people
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.980]   living on the planet now,
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:38.980]   but their lifestyle does represent the closest approximation
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   to how our ancestors, early humans lived.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.080]   And so those microbiomes,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.920]   and now we know from sequencing of paleofeces,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.140]   the microbiome of these traditional populations
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.200]   is more representative of the microbiome
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.120]   that we evolved with that potentially shaped
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.440]   our human genome.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   And so one possibility is that in the industrialized world,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.640]   we have a different microbiome from traditional populations
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.480]   and that microbiome is well adapted
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.040]   to our current lifestyle and therefore healthy
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   in the context of an industrialized society.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.060]   And there probably are elements of that that are true.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.740]   But another possibility is that this is a microbiome
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.320]   that's gone off the rails,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.740]   that it is deteriorating in the face of antibiotic use
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.740]   and all the problems associated with industrialized diet,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:37.400]   Western diet, and that even though the human microbiome
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.520]   project documented the microbiome of healthy people,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.800]   healthy Americans,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.620]   that what they really may have been documenting there
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.760]   is a perturbed microbiota that's really predisposing people
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.860]   to a variety of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.520]   - It reminds me of the, as a neurobiologist,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.400]   I was weaned in the landscape of so-called critical periods
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   where early life environment very strongly shapes the brain
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.960]   and so many studies were done on animals
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.080]   raised in traditional cages with a water bottle
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.180]   and some food, maybe a few other animals of the same species
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.880]   and then people came along and said,
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.760]   "Wait, normally these species in the wild
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   "would have things like things to climb over
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.600]   "and things to go through."
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.720]   And you provide those very basic elements
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.080]   and all of a sudden the architecture of neural circuits
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.300]   looks very different and you realize
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.120]   that you were studying a deprived condition.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.700]   And earlier you actually referred to,
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.200]   if I understood correctly,
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.500]   to critical periods for gut microbiome development.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.680]   Is it fair to say that there are critical periods?
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.120]   Meaning if my, let's say my, let's aim it at me,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.440]   if my gut microbiome was dysbiotic,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.200]   it was off early in life,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.600]   can I rescue that through proper conditions and exercise?
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.340]   Or is there some sort of fixed pattern
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.200]   that's going to be hard for me to escape from?
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.840]   - Yeah, there's a big field that's emerging now
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.320]   that we refer to as kind of reprogramming the gut microbiome.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.120]   And I think if we want to conceptualize humans
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.580]   as this aggregate human microbial biology,
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.040]   most people have heard of CRISPR
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.120]   and the ability to potentially change our human genome
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.980]   in ways that correct genetic problems.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.040]   That's a wonderful technology
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.060]   and has kind of put on the table,
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.320]   genetic engineering for curing disease,
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.000]   but it's much easier to change gut microbes for a problem
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   just because that community is malleable.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.400]   The issue that I think we're seeing in the field
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.120]   is that microbiomes quite often,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.280]   whether they're diseased or healthy,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.880]   exist in stable states.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.320]   They kind of tend towards this well
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.040]   that has gravity to it in a way, biological gravity,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.520]   where it's really hard to dislodge that community
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.720]   from that state.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.760]   So even individuals, for instance, that get antibiotics,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.120]   you take oral antibiotics, the community takes this huge hit.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.380]   We know that a bunch of microbes die,
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.400]   the composition changes,
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.280]   and that represents a period of vulnerability
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.980]   where pathogens can come in and take over and cause disease.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.840]   But if that doesn't happen,
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.480]   the microbiota kind of works its way back
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.500]   to something that is not exactly like,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.140]   but similar to the pre-antibiotic treatment.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.220]   We know with dietary perturbations,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.020]   quite often you'll see a really rapid change
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.300]   to the gut microbiome.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.260]   And then it's almost like a memory where it snaps back
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.500]   to something that's very similar to the original state,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.900]   even though the diet remains different.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.820]   And so there's this incredible,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.740]   what we refer to as resilience of the gut microbiome
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.020]   and resistance to change,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.040]   or at least resistance to establishing a new stable state.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.480]   So that doesn't mean it's hopeless to change
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.180]   an unhealthy microbiome to a healthy microbiome,
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.380]   but it does mean that we need to think carefully
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.180]   about restructuring these communities
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.340]   in ways where we can achieve a new stable state
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.880]   that will resist the microbial community
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.200]   getting pulled back to that original state.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   And one of the really kind of simplest and nicest examples
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.240]   of this is an experiment that we performed with mice,
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.100]   where we were feeding mice a normal mouse diet,
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.500]   a lot of nutrients there for the gut microbiota,
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.220]   things like dietary fiber.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.940]   And we switched those mice,
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.520]   half the mice to a low fiber diet.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.220]   And we were basically asking the question that,
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.740]   if you switch to kind of a Western like diet,
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.940]   a low fiber, higher fat diet,
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.740]   what happens to the gut microbiota?
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.940]   And we saw the microbiota change, it lost diversity.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.020]   It was very similar to what we see
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.780]   in the difference between industrialized
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.340]   and traditional populations.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.980]   But when we brought back a healthy diet,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.340]   a lot of the microbes returned and it was fairly,
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.340]   you know, there was this kind of memory
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.420]   where it went back to very similar to its original state.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.940]   The difference is that when we put the mice
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.300]   on a low fiber, high fat diet,
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.140]   and then kept them on that for multiple generations,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.540]   we saw this progressive deterioration
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.200]   over the course of generations,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.060]   where by the fourth generation,
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.980]   the gut microbiome was a, you know,
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.720]   a fraction of what it originally was.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.060]   Let's say 30% of the species only remained,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.200]   something like 70% of the species had gone extinct
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.420]   or appeared to have gone extinct.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.540]   We then put those mice back onto a high fiber diet
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.360]   and we didn't see recovery.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.020]   So in that case, it's a situation
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.580]   where a new stable state has been achieved.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.440]   In that case, it's probably because those mice
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.300]   don't actually have access to the microbes they've lost.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.560]   And we actually know that we did the control experiment
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.720]   of mice on a high fiber diet for four generations.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.280]   They maintain all their microbes.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.740]   If we take those fourth generation mice
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.540]   with all the diversity and do a fecal transplant
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.980]   into the mice that had lost their microbes,
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.340]   but had been returned to a high fiber diet,
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.580]   all of the diversity was reconstituted.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.520]   So it was, you know, so your question of like,
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.600]   how do we establish new stable states?
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.380]   How do we get back to a healthy microbiota?
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.560]   If we have taken a lot of antibiotics
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.460]   or have a deteriorated microbiota,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.960]   it's probably a combination of having access
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.440]   to the right microbes.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.880]   And we can talk about what that access looks like.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.560]   It may look like therapeutics in the future.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.840]   There are a lot of companies working on creating cocktails
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.200]   of healthy microbes, but it will be a combination
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.540]   of access to the right microbes
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.940]   and nourishing those microbes with the proper diet.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.780]   - Very interesting.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.640]   This multi-generational study reminds me of something
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.800]   that I was told early in my training,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.200]   which was that it takes a long time for a trait to evolve,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.400]   but not a long time for traits to devolve.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.240]   - Exactly.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.360]   - Which generally is true of human behavior too,
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.600]   although it depends.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.920]   We can all do better nonetheless.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.760]   - Very interesting.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.400]   - So I have a puzzle or a bit of a conundrum
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.520]   around this notion of species of microbiota.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.880]   So if the pH, if the acidity differs
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.760]   along the digestive tract,
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.120]   but is more or less fixed for a given location, right?
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.280]   I mean, unless something is really off,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.920]   the pH of the stomach is within a particular range
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.540]   and the intestine and so forth.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.980]   And certain microbiota thrive at a given station,
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.520]   a given location along the digestive tract
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.680]   and the pH is sort of fixed more or less.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.420]   I'm trying to figure out
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.940]   what is allowing certain microbiota
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.980]   to stay in a given location?
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.700]   Why don't they migrate up or down?
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.000]   So are they pH sensitive?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.300]   And that's what they're selecting for along the tract.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.100]   And I'm also trying to figure out how these changes in food
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.440]   so robustly change the microbiome.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.620]   The way you describe it almost makes it sound like food
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.840]   is the variable that's going to dictate
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.780]   the quality of the microbiome.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.900]   Although I'm sure there are other factors as well.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.460]   And then in the back of my mind,
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.220]   I don't know that I want to ask this question,
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.660]   but I really want to ask this question,
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.720]   which is where are they in there exactly?
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.580]   And why don't they all get flushed out, right?
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.580]   If 30% of fecal matter is microbiota,
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.340]   then where are they living?
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.560]   Are they along the lining
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.980]   and the little microvilli of the intestine?
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.140]   And what are they attaching to and interacting with?
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.660]   We know there are neurons in there,
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.900]   especially within the stomach.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.300]   There's a lot of work now being done on the gut neurons
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.380]   and how they signal to the brain and so forth.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.700]   But who are they talking to in terms of the host cells?
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.100]   And because if it's just from food,
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.140]   I imagine that they're in there
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.380]   having their good time or not.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.980]   And then some are getting flushed out or not.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   But how do they actually stay in there?
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.420]   Who are they attaching to?
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.580]   What are they talking about?
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.540]   What are they doing for fun and so forth?
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.340]   - Yeah, yeah, super interesting.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.800]   So I'll come back to the attachment question
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.760]   and kind of like why they don't get washed out
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.820]   'cause this is a super fascinating question.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.140]   And I think your initial point
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.460]   of like the kind of regional differences
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.660]   in what's happening in terms of physiology,
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.800]   biochemistry along the length of the gut
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.640]   is really interesting.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.320]   There certainly is a pH gradient
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.580]   along the length of the gut.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.680]   There is actually bicarbonate that's secreted
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.380]   into the small intestine to try to neutralize stomach acid.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.940]   There also is bile that's secreted.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.500]   That creates a different chemical environment
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.640]   and there are bile loving bacteria
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.040]   that kind of live in that region of the gut.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.180]   And then there is a nutrient gradient
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.040]   just because as food leaves the stomach,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.380]   a lot of the simple nutrients are absorbed.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.860]   And so you might see microbes in the small intestine,
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.720]   for instance, that are better at consuming simple sugars,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.220]   but you won't find many microbes in the colon like that
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.420]   because all the simple sugars
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.660]   have been depleted at that point.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.820]   And then the immune system is a big factor as well.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.400]   And the immune system is incredibly active
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.300]   in the small intestine.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.580]   The small intestine is this really interesting challenge
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.860]   for the host because it's a tissue that's been,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.100]   its purpose is mainly absorptive.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:30.100]   And so there has to be flow of a lot of things,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:35.100]   a lot of nutrients from the luminal contents
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.700]   into host cells.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   And so that means the barrier can't be as fortified.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.340]   And so the immune system is incredibly active
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.260]   in the small intestine to make sure
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.420]   that microbes aren't getting so close.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.900]   And if they are getting close,
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.860]   there's a response to them to put them back
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.680]   in their right location.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   So there's, and then along this whole kind of architecture
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.000]   of the gut, there's the longitudinal gradients,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.100]   things like pH and so forth.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.500]   And I should say that pH starts to drop again in the colon
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.220]   because a lot of those microbes are fermenting things
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.840]   and producing acids.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.940]   And so you actually end up with the pH starting to drop,
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.300]   not as low as the stomach, but starting to drop again
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.840]   if there's a lot of fermentation happening in the colon.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.740]   In addition, you also have a gradient
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.740]   from the host surface epithelium
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.660]   out to the middle of the gut.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.660]   And that is likely the key for what is retained in the gut
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:41.160]   and how the community isn't washed out.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.620]   So lining the gut, we have epithelial cells
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.320]   in the small intestine, they're largely absorptive.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.780]   In the colon, there's a lot of mucus production.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.620]   And we also see this in the small intestine.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.460]   And this mucus lining is this substance that we secrete,
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.020]   largely made of carbohydrate actually.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.940]   And the purpose of that is to keep microbes
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.500]   in the right spot and to allow nutrients and water
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.700]   to be absorbed in the small intestine and large intestine.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.260]   And so it's this mesh work that is supposed
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.180]   to keep out large things like bacteria
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.720]   and let in small things like nutrients.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:25.840]   That mucus layer, it turns over more slowly
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.460]   than the luminal contents passing by.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:34.120]   And so if a microbe learns to hold on to that mucus layer,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   it can actually resist the flow of the contents of the gut.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.340]   And so there's many microbes in the gut
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.580]   that are not just good at attaching to mucus,
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.360]   but also good at nibbling on it, at eating it.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.940]   And there are these bacteria like Acromancea muciniphila,
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.860]   mucus-loving, one of its main things it does
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.580]   is actually eat mucus in the gut, that's its lifestyle.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:03.580]   And so there's an incredible gradient of activity
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.780]   from the host tissue working your way
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.260]   out to the middle of the gut.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.140]   What's amazing is some microbes actually do penetrate
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.980]   past the mucus and there are these invaginations
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.200]   in the intestine known as crypts,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.520]   actually where the stem cells live,
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.980]   that produce the epithelium.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.780]   And there are microbial communities
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.740]   that can form in those crypts.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.300]   And we don't know completely what their function is,
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.860]   but we've done some studies that appear to indicate
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.620]   that if you can localize to a crypt,
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.400]   you've hit the jackpot as a microbe
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.460]   for being able to maintain dominance in the gut.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.380]   So if you sit in the crypt and something similar to you,
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.920]   another microbe that's similar to you comes into the gut,
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.400]   you can actually exclude that microbe.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.380]   And the thinking is that it can't find a spot
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.080]   to resist being washed out of the gut.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   So there probably are these little niches
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.940]   close to host tissue in the mucus
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.380]   that are absolutely essential for resisting
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.860]   getting washed out with the flow of all the contents.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.480]   - Incredible.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.600]   That raises a question about two things
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.940]   that are reasonably popular.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.060]   One is this notion of cleanses from either direction.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.660]   People will consume things by mouth
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.340]   to try and cleanse their digestive tract.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.060]   There's a long history of this.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.260]   I'm not recommending this.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.860]   There's differing opinions on whether or not
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.020]   this is good or bad.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.900]   And the other is fasting or time-restricted feeding.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.780]   The reason I ask about time-restricted feeding
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.260]   is my understanding is that
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.980]   after a prolonged period of fasting,
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.300]   there's some auto absorption or digestion
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.860]   of one's own digestive tract that then gets renewed.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.780]   In other words, your intestine and stomach
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.720]   start eating its own lining to some extent
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.100]   in the absence of food.
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.220]   So what do we know about cleanses?
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.460]   Oh, and then I suppose there's cleanses
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.860]   from the other direction too, right?
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.300]   Which are less popular,
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.820]   but I've never run the statistics,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.180]   but certainly exist out there.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.760]   What's the idea about cleanses and fasting
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.060]   as it relates to the health
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.540]   or the dysbiosis of the microbiota?
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.760]   - Yeah, there hasn't been a lot of high quality science
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.600]   in this area.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.900]   And so it's really hard to conclude
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.820]   whether these are good for health or bad for health.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.540]   I think the fasting,
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:21.500]   we're in a really interesting situation
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.100]   in the industrialized world
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.740]   because we have so many problems
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.520]   associated with our digestive tract.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.140]   And that probably has to do with our highly processed diet
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.860]   and perhaps having a microbiota
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.020]   that's fairly perturbed as well.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:39.020]   And so whether doing things like this are good or bad,
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:46.980]   it's really hard to define
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.420]   because we may be starting off in a fairly bad state anyway.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.380]   There are so many diseases
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.380]   that we're dealing with, metabolic syndrome,
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.140]   inflammatory bowel disease,
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.420]   that just put a massive portion of the population
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.640]   in a very different category
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.520]   than people that are thinking about how do I maintain health?
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.000]   How do I live a long life from starting off
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.540]   in what we consider a fairly healthy state?
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:16.540]   And so things like fasting and a lot of other therapies
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.700]   that have been developed in the field,
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.060]   I think ketogenic diet
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.700]   may be kind of in this category as well.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.960]   There can be tremendous benefits
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.580]   in terms of their impact
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.860]   in the context of metabolic syndrome
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.660]   and for people that are battling
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:37.260]   eating a continual bad diet or something like that.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.700]   - And adherence.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.100]   I think one of the reasons for the popularity
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.540]   of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.400]   and sort of what do they call them now?
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.360]   Exclusion diets where you entirely exclude meat
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.100]   or you entirely exclude plants or whatever it is,
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.900]   that adherence is sometimes easier in the all or none.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.940]   As neurobiologists, we think of it as a go-no-go circuitry.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:04.540]   It's harder to make decisions,
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.320]   nuanced decisions often about food
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.440]   than it is to just eliminate entire categories of food.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.460]   Not eating for many people
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.760]   is easier than eating smaller portions.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.180]   So some of it I think is neurobiological and psychological.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.060]   - Absolutely, and we've had gastroenterology fellows
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.500]   in our lab that come in and we kind of,
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.060]   I think that to kind of slice through the nuance
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.100]   of all this, there's a very simple recipe
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.060]   and a really well-accepted kind of broad definition
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.500]   of what a healthy diet is.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.980]   Kind of the Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is,
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.700]   there's just a ton of data that,
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.020]   particularly people of European ancestry,
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.300]   but there's a pretty broad acceptance
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.560]   that if you eat mostly plants,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.900]   for most people that's gonna be very healthy
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.660]   to the point where a wonderful colleague of ours,
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.940]   Christopher Gardner, who's studied diet his whole life,
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.920]   trying to establish what a healthy diet is
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.240]   and people was giving advice.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.280]   I saw him giving advice to a dietician
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.120]   who was trying to get all the rules
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.520]   of what she should be recommending
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.160]   to people that she deals with
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.860]   that are interested in a healthy diet.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.420]   And she said, so the number one,
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.100]   I'm gonna say plant-based fiber is probably super important
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.080]   and that should be very high on the list.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.420]   And she goes on to number two and he said, stop.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.580]   He said, if people do number one well,
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.540]   you don't need to know any other rules.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   I mean, it's basically like
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.480]   if you can have a high fiber plant-based diet,
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.980]   for most people, at least talking about the bucket
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.200]   of people that are already in a healthy state,
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.860]   you don't really need to think about other things
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.340]   because you can't eat too much meat,
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.580]   you can't eat too many sweets,
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.780]   you've already eaten a huge amount of plant-based fiber.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.460]   Your gut is full, you're not gonna be hungry
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.020]   and it kind of takes care of worrying
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.300]   about what should I eat or what shouldn't I eat.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.300]   Just eat a ton of whole grains, legumes, vegetables,
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.740]   fruit that's high fiber-based, not high sugar.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.660]   - It doesn't completely exclude meat and fish and dairy.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.980]   - And he was saying people can add their own spins on this,
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.300]   but I think that the main rule
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.060]   is just start off with,
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.860]   and it kind of gets back to Michael Pollan's mantra,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.020]   eat food, not too much, mostly plants.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.940]   I think if you stick with kind of these simple rules
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.360]   and don't overthink like, should I have this,
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.100]   can I eat eggs, can I eat,
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.760]   just kind of stick to these simple rules,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.440]   it makes it very approachable.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.660]   But I agree, so these gastroenterology fellows
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.580]   that we've had in our lab say that it's really hard,
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.640]   we kind of say to them,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.560]   why won't you give this dietary advice?
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.780]   It's really well known.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.700]   And they just said, well, it's really hard
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.600]   to get people to change their diet
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.200]   unless you're doing either a go, no-go sort of thing,
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.060]   or eliminating something.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.000]   So if carrots are giving you problems, don't eat carrots.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.540]   And that's a very simple, easy instruction to follow,
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.940]   but doesn't really deal with the root problem
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.900]   of why can't you eat carrots?
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.760]   Because you should be able to eat carrots.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.160]   Most people can eat carrots.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.660]   And so I think that we,
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.660]   yeah, when we're thinking about things like fasting
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.140]   and all these different dietary regimes
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.480]   and cleanses that people do,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.420]   we have to step back for a moment and say,
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.300]   okay, well, what are really the big high-level rules
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.640]   that we should take home?
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.840]   And then if you are experiencing problems
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.600]   and you want to think about how to deal with them,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.880]   it's good to go to an evidence-based method
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.900]   where there's actually data to back it up.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:40.900]   The data in the field really shows that with fasting,
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.520]   particularly if you go to animals that hibernate
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.700]   or things like that, where there's really extended fast,
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.900]   you actually have a microbiota come up
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.900]   that blooms in the absence of food coming in through diet.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.260]   That's really good at eating mucus.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.140]   So you have bacteria that specialize
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.240]   in eating nutrients derived from the host
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.560]   because there's no other nutrients to live on.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.420]   Now, whether this is good or bad, we don't know,
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:13.420]   but it seems like the consumption of mucus in excess
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:18.980]   is a problem from the standpoint of microbes
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.680]   getting too close to host tissue and inciting inflammation,
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.260]   which is what we see in animal models
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.760]   when we deprive of dietary fiber.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.460]   We see these mucus utilizers become abundant
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.460]   and inflammatory markers start to come on.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.540]   So fasting short-term might be fine.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.220]   Probably there's definitely benefits
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.940]   that are seen metabolically.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.520]   In terms of what it means for long-term health
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.320]   from the standpoint of the gut microbiota,
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.720]   I would say we don't have the answer to that yet.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:48.840]   In terms of the cleanses and the flushes and all this,
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.280]   personally, I think it's a terrible idea.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.480]   We know that in studies that are being done now
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.460]   to reprogram the gut microbiota
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.360]   to install a completely new microbial community,
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.620]   the first step is to wash away the resident microbial
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.900]   community that's there.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.060]   So if you're in the process of acquiring
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.760]   a really good microbiota and you know how to do that,
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.700]   then the flushing everything out is great.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.100]   Otherwise, what is happening is you're kind of leaving
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.600]   rebuilding of the community to chance, like what is it?
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.240]   And so what microbes are gonna colonize?
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.620]   Who's gonna take up space after you do this flush or cleanse?
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:31.200]   And I think it's a little bit like playing Russian roulette.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.060]   You may end up with a good microbial community
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   in there afterwards, you may not.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.700]   You certainly want to pay close attention
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.900]   to what you're eating while you're doing
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.380]   the reconstitution of the community
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.060]   after you do something like that.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.180]   - Yeah, thank you for that.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.560]   I know a lot of people are interested
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.460]   in these kinds of elimination diets
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.060]   and intermittent fasting/time-restricted feeding
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.700]   seems to be getting some traction in part
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.540]   because at some level, we are all doing this
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.780]   when we sleep.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.720]   Most of us aren't eating while we sleep anyway.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.780]   And adjusting the numbers seems more accessible
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.620]   for a lot of people.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.700]   We have a lot of colleagues at Stanford
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.920]   who I know happen to follow that regimen
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.740]   or a time-restricted feeding regimen,
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:15.380]   but also some who follow the more traditional meal spacing
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.640]   as well, of course.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.300]   One of the things that I wonder about as we talk about
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.740]   primarily plant-based with some,
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.040]   what did you say the pollen thing was?
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.820]   It was eat mostly plants and then maybe some meat,
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.500]   but not too much or not too much.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.460]   - Eat food, mostly plants, not too much.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.440]   - Got it. - Or sorry,
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.060]   eat food, not too much, mostly plants.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:35.900]   - Got it.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.420]   I hear this again and again.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.060]   I know there are a number of people
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.940]   who do seem to do well on a lower carbohydrate.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.120]   Even some people who report feeling much better
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.500]   on a really strictly almost meat organ only diet.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.500]   And the only reason I raised this is not,
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.900]   I don't participate in it.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:01.060]   I'm one of those omnivores out there.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.540]   I do eat some meat and I do eat plants as well.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.720]   But the reason I raised this is that earlier
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.040]   you were talking about communities
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:13.360]   that may have microbiota that are healthier than ours
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.980]   or at least different than ours.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.400]   And there are communities in the world
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.580]   that subsist largely on animal products
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.460]   or for which unprocessed animal products
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.900]   are considered the richest nutrient foods
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.100]   in those communities.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.860]   Protein is very scarce and ancestrally protein
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.900]   was more scarce.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.700]   So eggs and meat and things of that sort.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.380]   So could there be a genetic component?
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.600]   In other words, if we fast forward 10 years
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.840]   and we actually can make sense
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.260]   of all this human genome stuff,
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.260]   are we going to find that someone who has Scandinavian roots
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.180]   or somebody who has South American roots
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.700]   or somebody had descended from a different tribe
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.540]   will do better on one particular diet versus another
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:56.320]   and thereby, or I should say, and in parallel with that,
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.600]   that their gut microbiome will have different signatures
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.060]   that are, so your microbiome might thrive on plants
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.180]   and mine might thrive on organ meats.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.900]   And as I say this, I'm not a big consumer of organ meats.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.300]   I'm just laying this out for sake of example.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.800]   - Yeah, yeah, great.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.300]   So a few notes.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.900]   The first one has to do with the carbohydrates
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.300]   and restriction of carbohydrates
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.740]   and some people feeling healthier
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.740]   when they cut carbohydrates out.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:28.740]   My guess is, this is my theory to be tested,
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.300]   that people feel better cutting carbohydrates out
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.460]   because the diet that we eat in the United States
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.400]   and in industrialized countries,
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.240]   the carbohydrates are largely crap.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.780]   - Processed. - They're processed.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.360]   It's like starch, simple sugar.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.100]   It's things that contribute to glycemic index.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.220]   It's these sugars that we eat.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.260]   They make it to our small intestine.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.780]   They get chopped up into simple sugars,
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.180]   absorbed into our bloodstream
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:00.860]   and we have a ton of glucose then coursing through our veins
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.580]   which we know is bad and can lead to things like diabetes.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:08.940]   If the carbohydrates that were in our diet
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.820]   were complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber,
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.660]   and we like to refer to the subset of dietary fiber
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.500]   that the microbiota can actually access as microbiota
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.540]   accessible carbohydrates.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.960]   And the reason that we like that term
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.840]   is it has the word carbohydrate in it.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.280]   And it's to point out that not all carbs are bad.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.300]   It's just there are bad carbs or carbs that are bad
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.140]   if you consume them in too high a quantity,
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.820]   things like table sugar and simple starches,
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.500]   but there are good carbs as well.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.940]   And these microbiota accessible carbohydrates
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.420]   are the complex ones that we can't digest
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.220]   and fuel our gut microbiota.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.060]   Our gut microbiota can ferment them.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:53.060]   And so I think we probably all would be better off
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:59.020]   with less of the carbs that were typically served,
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:03.420]   but most of us and probably the vast majority of us
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.820]   would be better off by consuming a lot more carbs
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.700]   that were complex, that were microbiota accessible.
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.600]   And I'll come back to why that's important
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.680]   in terms of our biology.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.340]   There are some mechanisms that are known
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.460]   as to why those complex carbohydrates are so important
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.560]   for our health for most of us.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.860]   I think this aspect of human genetic adaptation to diet
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.440]   is super interesting.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.140]   And then layer on top of that,
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.960]   gut microbiota adaptation to diet,
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.180]   which is another layer of this that is also fascinating.
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.940]   It's very clear that over very short periods of time,
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.600]   humans can adapt to differences in their diet.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.820]   Lactase persistence is kind of the classic example of this.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.680]   Just over the past 10,000 years,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:49.020]   humans, certain groups of humans have adapted
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:54.020]   to being able to consume dairy by taking this enzyme lactase
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.700]   that normally is just expressed
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.200]   in most of the world's population early in life
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.980]   to be able to metabolize lactose in breast milk.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.860]   By extending the expression of that throughout life,
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.100]   now you can consume milk for your whole life.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.500]   And so that is an example of specific populations
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:16.660]   of human genome genetically adapting to diet
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.960]   in a very short period of time.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.740]   And there are other examples of this,
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.500]   and undoubtedly this has happened throughout the world
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.780]   to various aspects of diets.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.120]   So certainly it's important to remember
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.860]   that there will be different diets that are better
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:35.200]   for different groups based on what genes you harbor
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.500]   and have in your human genome.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.300]   The other aspect on top of that
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:44.300]   is that there are good examples of the gut microbiome
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:49.120]   adapting to cultural differences in diet.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.100]   And the classic example of this
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.060]   is the degradation of seaweed.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.220]   So we know that most Americans,
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.440]   if you eat sushi and there's nori there
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.460]   and you eat some of this seaweed,
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.900]   it has a dietary fiber in it known as porphyrin.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:10.180]   That porphyrin will shoot through most of us untransformed.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.620]   Inert substance, it'll do other things like retain water
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.700]   and serve as kind of something like cellulose,
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.820]   not be fermented at a high level.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.300]   If somebody from Southeast Asia
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.180]   that's always consumed seaweed
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.780]   and is part of a culture that consumes seaweed, eat seaweed,
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:31.220]   they have a gut microbe that can now metabolize porphyrin.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.560]   And so there are these very specific gene transfer events
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.480]   where the genes for breaking down porphyrin
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.200]   have been imported into the microbiome
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.440]   of many people in Southeast Asia to,
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.520]   we can think of it as helping digest porphyrin,
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.140]   but it's really just a microbe that's found a niche,
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.440]   found a way to make a living in the gut
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:55.480]   by consuming something that's common in the diet there.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.740]   So there are these different layers.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.240]   There are human genetic adaptations
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.840]   and there are microbiome adaptations that are cultural
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.540]   and based on people's geographic location.
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.340]   But there's no escaping the fact
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.660]   that for much of human evolution,
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.780]   the vast majority of people that are on this planet
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:18.660]   had ancestors that were hunter-gatherers foraging,
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.120]   consuming huge quantities of plant material,
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.360]   just because that's what was there.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.240]   And so one of the groups that we study,
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.220]   the Hadza hunter-gatherers in Africa,
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:34.080]   and I should take a moment just to say that our research
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.800]   and research of many people in our field and other fields
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.960]   rely on study of indigenous communities.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.680]   And it's really important to think of these communities
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.520]   as our equals, they're modern people on the planet.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.900]   They have interesting lifestyles that are informative
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:54.540]   with regard to certain aspects of human biology.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.640]   But in many cases, they also are
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.920]   leading vulnerable existence.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.640]   And so we really take great care in our research program
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.220]   and it's important for people to realize
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:07.360]   that these populations take partner research
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.660]   because they're wonderful research partners.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:14.120]   And we need to be mindful of kind of thinking about how,
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.000]   yeah, both we talk about them and use our data
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.080]   that has been gained through their generous contribution
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.720]   to our research program.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.680]   The Hadza hunter-gatherers, it's estimated,
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   consume on the order of 100 to 150 grams
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.660]   of dietary fiber per day.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.900]   And that's in stark contrast to the typical American
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.500]   that consumes about 15 grams.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:40.180]   So somewhere seven to 10 fold decrease in the main nutrient
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.720]   that feeds our gut microbiome in the American diet.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:48.000]   The Hadza are, you know, one example,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.740]   there are many different foraging populations,
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:54.020]   but the vast majority of these populations
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.700]   consume huge amounts of dietary fiber
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.240]   because plants are the reliable, consistent source that,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.900]   you know, if you, as a hunter-gatherer, go on a hunt,
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.200]   usually that hunt is unsuccessful.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.280]   You know, I think the data that, you know,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.960]   one out of 20 to 30 hunts are successful
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.740]   in landing actually big game for the Hadza.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.420]   They have, you know, birds that they shoot
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.840]   and small animals, but quite often day after day,
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   they're relying upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.600]   You know, they're relying on the plants in their environment.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.360]   And actually, if you go to the data
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.380]   and look at what their food preferences are,
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.920]   their food preferences are actually meat and honey.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.380]   So they don't eat a high fiber diet because they love fiber.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.400]   They eat a high fiber diet because that's what's available
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.840]   and consistent for them to survive.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.020]   But, you know, our brains are wired for caloric density.
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.680]   And so if you took a Hadza and put them in a restaurant
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.360]   in the United States, they would make
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.240]   the same crappy decisions that we make
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.500]   because we, you know, all want sugar and fat and calories.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.440]   It's how our brain is wired.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.760]   - And protein and fat are essential for brain development
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760]   as far as we know, right?
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   So it sounds like the Hadza,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.500]   I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.060]   Oh, you said would prefer to eat meat and honey,
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.560]   but they do, they happen to consume a lot of plant fiber
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.560]   as a consequence of what's available.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.440]   The, one of the questions I have as it relates
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.360]   to all of this is it sounds to me like there is no question
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:34.000]   from the pure vegan all the way to the extreme opposite,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.520]   which would be pure meat diet that avoiding processed foods
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.840]   is a good idea or heavily processed foods in general.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.420]   And I mean, not that, you know,
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.860]   the occasional consumption is necessarily bad,
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.360]   but whether or not one is thinking
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.440]   about one macronutrient profile or another,
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.780]   it sounds like consuming processed foods
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.720]   is just bad for the microbiome.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.480]   Can we say that categorically?
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.320]   - For sure.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.140]   - Okay. - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.620]   - Whether, you know, so you're low carb person,
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.520]   you're zero carb person, you're extreme vegan, no meat,
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.520]   whether or not you're all meat, organ meat,
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.120]   it sounds to me as if the number one thing,
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.760]   maybe even dare I say above Chris's point about plants,
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.100]   so that I'm not going to challenge Chris Gardner
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.400]   on nutrition, I would be way outside the lane lines
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.920]   to do that, but is it to avoiding processed foods is paramount.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.040]   - Yeah, and I think that's completely compatible
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.000]   with what Christopher was saying.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.520]   He was saying, if you prioritize getting a huge amount
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.980]   of whole plant-based food with a lot of fiber first,
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.000]   you're not going to have room
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.420]   for eating a lot of processed food.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.080]   So it's kind of the same as avoiding processed food.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.320]   So I think that those are exactly the same rule.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.680]   And I think that you're exactly right.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.400]   And we can break down, you know, there's a lot of data
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.720]   of why different components of processed food are so bad
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.520]   for us and so bad for our microbiome.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.720]   And I can talk about a few examples of that.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.040]   But the flip side of this is this mechanism of, you know,
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.080]   and again, thinking about the spectrum of a plant-based diet
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.080]   versus a meat-based diet, you know, there's a lot of data
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:11.160]   to tell us that a meat or ketogenic or high fat diet
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.360]   may have big benefits in terms of short-term metabolic
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.220]   health, that's typically how people think about that diet.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.740]   There's also a lot of heart disease
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.040]   that's linked with that as well.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.240]   There's good literature for that,
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.120]   which is something for people to look at and be aware of.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.140]   The plant-based diet, if you're eating a bunch of complex,
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.960]   you know, fibers that feed your gut microbiota,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.760]   your gut microbiota produces these substances
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.560]   called short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.260]   And it's known that these short-chain fatty acids
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.000]   play really essential components,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.340]   both in terms of fueling colonocytes,
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.960]   enforcing the barrier, keeping inflammation low,
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.840]   regulating the immune system, regulating metabolism.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.480]   And so, you know, a lot of people think of dietary fiber
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.540]   as this inert substance that passes through,
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.400]   makes us feel full maybe for a little bit,
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.160]   but we get hungry afterwards right away.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.440]   If you're eating a lot of fiber
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.160]   that's feeding your gut microbiota,
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.260]   your gut microbiota is just producing this vast array
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.780]   of fermentation and products that then get absorbed
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.560]   into our bloodstream and have all of these tremendous
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.920]   cascading effects that appear to be largely beneficial
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.120]   in our biology.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.880]   And so to think about that paradigm of simple carbs
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.600]   versus complex carbs, in the case of simple carbs,
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.560]   you end up with high blood sugar, you know,
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.140]   something that will spike your insulin and, you know,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.400]   have all kinds of weird metabolic effects.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.620]   In the case of complex carbohydrates,
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.060]   you'll end up with very low blood sugar
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.600]   because most of those have low glycemic index
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.400]   and a bunch of short-chain fatty acids
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.840]   that are having regulatory rules.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.860]   So just to round out that topic,
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.500]   I think there is a reason to think that, you know,
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.440]   maybe not appropriate for absolutely everyone out there,
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.160]   but I think the vast majority of people,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.060]   particularly given the statistics of what we know people eat
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.880]   in the United States and in industrialized countries,
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.720]   most people would reap tremendous health benefits
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.620]   from eating more whole plant-based dietary fiber.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.340]   Now, processed foods, I think, is this other dimension
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.160]   where you have all of these weird chemicals,
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.060]   artificial sweeteners, weird fats, you know,
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.600]   a lot of refined simple nutrients.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.080]   The simple nutrients we've talked about,
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.540]   but we know that, for instance, artificial sweeteners
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.540]   can have a massive negative impact on the gut microbiome
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.960]   and can lead us towards metabolic syndrome, actually.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.400]   There's been beautiful work
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.200]   out of the Weizmann Institute on this.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.400]   And then emulsifiers, these compounds
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.180]   that are put in processed foods
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.180]   to help them maintain shelf stability
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.560]   so things don't separate.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.220]   And so, you know, all the moisture content
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.760]   is retained appropriately.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.040]   Many of these are known to disrupt the mucus layer.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.260]   And as soon as you start disrupting that barrier,
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.800]   that can lead you in the direction of inflammation.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.760]   And in animal models, we know that can lead
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.400]   towards metabolic syndrome as well.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.920]   So there's components of processed food
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.700]   that are, when studied in isolation,
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.520]   known to have a direct negative impact
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.760]   on gut biology and the microbiota.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.600]   - Yeah, the mention of artificial sweeteners is interesting.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.080]   I confess, it's a third rail on social,
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.280]   talking about artificial sweeteners.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.720]   There are two camps, it seems, or at least two camps.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.660]   One that say artificial sweeteners
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.200]   are not detrimental at all.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.680]   Another that says they're very detrimental,
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.000]   mainly based on the mouse studies.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.160]   And then there are people in the middle
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.160]   that are, I put myself in that category.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.000]   I drink the occasional diet soda.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.500]   I don't consume them in large volume,
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.060]   but I'm sort of in the middle there.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.900]   However, and so I just throw that out there
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.840]   because I know immediately people are jumping on that.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.320]   But I will just mention there's some recent data
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.760]   out of Diego Borges' lab at Duke University
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.440]   that the neurons that live in the gut mucus
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.120]   of these neuropod cells can actually distinguish
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.700]   between artificial and true sweet,
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.240]   sugar versus artificial sweeteners.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.200]   They send different patterns of neural signals
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.400]   up to the brain and the brain circuitry
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.760]   seems strongly impacted.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.620]   So I think that as the data emerge,
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.360]   we're hearing more and more of these artificial sweeteners
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.960]   either are problematic or at least are signaling
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.880]   different events in the gut.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.920]   I do want to make sure that we distinguish
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.300]   artificial sweeteners from non-caloric plant-based sweeteners.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.240]   And this is based on a mistake that I've made
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.940]   over and over again on the podcast,
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:20.040]   where I'll just kind of lump artificial sweeteners
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.160]   into one big category and then I'll mention stevia.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.940]   So what about plant-based sweeteners
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.560]   that are not artificial?
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.120]   They weren't manufactured in a laboratory
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   like saccharin or sucralose or aspartame.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.880]   Do we know anything about plant-based non-caloric sweeteners
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.960]   or low-caloric sweeteners?
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.020]   - Very little.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.200]   A lot of those have a lot more bang for the buck.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.120]   They're incredibly sweet so it takes a really small amount
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.320]   for them to trigger a huge amount of sweetness.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.200]   And so it's depending upon the mechanism of action
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.640]   by which these sweeteners that are not sugar
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.400]   are impacting our biology.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:02.280]   It may be that those are actually less negative
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.800]   or more healthy than the ones that are artificial
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.500]   just because it requires less of them in the food
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.320]   for us to perceive that sweet taste.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.480]   It may also be that because they're,
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.560]   I don't think that everything that's natural
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.380]   is better necessarily than things that are artificial,
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.360]   but it may be that because of kind of evolutionary exposure
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.680]   to these compounds in our diet,
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.320]   historically there are, I think, traditional populations
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   that use these, for instance, to sweeten different foods
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.000]   that our bodies just kind of know how to deal
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.140]   with those compounds better than the ones that are synthetic.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.980]   But I think the studies still need to be done.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.480]   - Do you actively avoid artificial sweeteners,
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.720]   sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, you personally?
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.520]   - Yeah, you know, so I do.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.980]   I avoid them, but I'm not, you know,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.960]   so I work closely with my wife, Erica, as you know.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.480]   We were in the lab together and we wrote this book,
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.520]   "The Good Gut," where we kind of document our journey
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.640]   in changing our lifestyle, dietary habits,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.400]   choices we make based on the research
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.280]   as we've gotten to know it in the gut microbiota
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.860]   over the past 15 years.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   And, you know, I think that one of the lessons
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:21.560]   that we've learned is that just doing things in moderation
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.240]   makes it a lot easier and doing things slowly
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.200]   makes it a lot easier.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.640]   And so there are very few rules that I have
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.720]   that are hard and fast.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.600]   I'm a pretty flexible eater.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.560]   I don't believe that having an artificial, you know,
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.920]   having a diet Coke will, you know,
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.280]   somehow cascade into some terrible disease
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.840]   or something like that.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.140]   I try to avoid them.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.520]   I don't really like the flavor of them.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.120]   I'm super sensitive to the nuances of the flavor,
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.500]   even with the, you know, stevia and magra sites
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.680]   from monk fruit and stuff like that.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.660]   I just really, the off flavors are really hard
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.720]   for me to deal with.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   But I also, in this journey of changing our diet,
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.560]   like when we started off in microbiome research,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.500]   I was in the habit of, you know, in the afternoons,
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.400]   having a sweet, a muffin or a cookie or something like that.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.080]   And when we started to realize that, you know,
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.480]   we should be eating less sweets
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.560]   and eating more dietary fiber,
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.960]   this was an incredibly difficult change for me to make.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.280]   I was just wired to kind of crave, you know, this.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.920]   - Classic scientist.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.040]   Scientists love the pastry in the afternoon and the coffee.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.720]   - And in the old days, it used to be a cigarette too.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.560]   - Right, right, exactly.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.080]   - When I started my training, a lot of people still smoke.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:29.920]   - Yeah, right.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.160]   - And it was only during my postdoctoral training
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.940]   that they eliminated smoking on campuses.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.240]   And productivity took a trough for a while.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.280]   And until these people developed other tools
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.080]   to focus their attention.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.240]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.180]   So there is this kind of like need.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.040]   And then once you have an ingrained behavior
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.340]   and maybe things that are addictive,
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.800]   it becomes incredibly difficult to break that habit.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.120]   And so I would say, you know, gradually over the course
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.160]   of like, you know, five or more years,
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.040]   we have, you know, migrated our diet away from sweet foods
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.800]   to things that are less sweet.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.920]   And it's, you know, it's been a journey.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.720]   It's been a slow process.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.920]   But we've gotten to the point now
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.760]   where we've just retrained our palates.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.960]   And it's amazing how this happens now
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.680]   where I'll have something that, you know,
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.720]   is something that I would have used to have like daily.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.440]   And it's unpalatable.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.900]   I like, I just can't deal with the sweetness of it.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.940]   And so I avoid, I certainly avoid artificial sweeteners,
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:31.440]   but I also avoid just sweet things in general
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.680]   that have sugar in them just because they now they,
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.520]   you know, as originally I was trying to be disciplined
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.540]   and trying to change my diet,
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.280]   but now they just don't taste good to me.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.120]   - Yeah, likewise.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.760]   I completely lost my appetite for sugar
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.960]   at the turn of the last year.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.220]   And I don't know how to explain it, but the way I,
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.260]   even though I don't have a mechanistic explanation,
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.820]   I just, I say, I like sweet people.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.440]   I don't like sweet food anymore.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.340]   I just don't.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.300]   I have not lost my appetite for fatty foods.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:02.560]   I love cheese and certain meats for me.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.200]   I blame my Argentine lineage as I gravitate towards them.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.480]   But in any case, avoiding processed foods,
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.920]   probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers,
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.760]   these kinds of things.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.800]   And for people listening or watching,
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.760]   we're not setting up strict guidelines.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.640]   We're just bouncing around the carnival
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.120]   that is the microbiome and nutrition,
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.440]   because I think that these, we hear this everywhere,
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.460]   eat this, don't eat that,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.720]   or this is best for microbiome or worst for microbiome,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.600]   but I'm hearing fiber again and again.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.040]   So we're going to come back to fiber,
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.720]   but I want to make sure that we close the hatch
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.180]   on this issue of fasting and cleansing.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.720]   Based on your answer earlier,
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.440]   it sounds to me like it is not necessary to do a cleanse
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.620]   or fast prior to an attempt to repopulate the microbiome.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.240]   In other words, if I want to make my microbiome healthier,
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.720]   it sounds like I don't have to try
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.280]   and flush all the current microbiota out of there first.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.120]   Is that correct?
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.200]   - Yeah, it's a very good question.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.920]   And I don't mean to suggest that those things
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.800]   are known to be terrible,
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.780]   or I would just say the studies haven't been done.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.760]   And to me, wiping out this microbial community,
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.440]   unless it's done with some sort of,
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.260]   unless it's done in an informed way,
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.740]   and we don't really have the information
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.080]   for how that would be done,
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.960]   it just seems like playing the lottery a little bit.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.000]   And so I think, I don't want to say that those are,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.840]   it may be that when the study is done,
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.520]   those are shown to be amazing,
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.640]   but I just don't think we have the data to know that yet.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.340]   So it's somewhat of an arbitrary thing.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.960]   If somebody out there feels way better when they do this
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.360]   and are not experiencing problems with it,
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.960]   then maybe it's the right thing for them.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.120]   But I certainly can't say that it's something great to do.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.720]   I can't imagine a future where as the microbiome
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.040]   gets incorporated into this emerging paradigm of precision
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.160]   health, you go into a clinic,
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.120]   somebody types your microbiome and says,
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.360]   oh, there's this huge, massive misconfiguration.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.080]   You have all these engrafted bacteria that live
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.040]   that are residents in your gut microbiome
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.080]   that are sending out molecules
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.720]   that are not good for your health.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.620]   It would be good if we do a mass reprogramming of it.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.640]   The way that we do that is we flush your gut
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.080]   and we actually give a light antibiotic treatment
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.080]   to try to kill everything that's there.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.480]   And then we repopulate with this other consortium
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.160]   of microbes that we've studied and know are healthy,
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.480]   know are compatible with your human genome
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.440]   and can be reinforced with a diet
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.040]   that we know is good for you.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.720]   We'll install those microbes.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.960]   We'll help you along in the diet
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.400]   so you know how to nourish those microbes.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.460]   And that will be the way that we'll reconfigure
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.400]   your gut microbiome.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.880]   So I can't imagine a future where that sort of flushing
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:46.700]   or cleansing is part of something for repopulating the gut.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:50.400]   But right now it seems a little half baked to me, yeah.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.920]   - Great.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.920]   I'd love to talk about fiber and fermented foods
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.460]   because you and Chris had a really,
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.620]   what I think is a really interesting and exciting paper
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:06.620]   at the end of last year about comparing the inflammatome,
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.740]   so inflammatory markers of people
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:11.260]   who ate a certain amount of fiber
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:13.600]   or a certain amount of these fermented foods.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.680]   This study is amazing for several reasons,
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.680]   but almost as amazing is how diverse the interpretation
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.660]   of this study was in the media.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.820]   If ever there was a study that was kind of hijacked
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:33.520]   by different priority schemes out there, it's this study.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.460]   So you performed the study with Chris
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.300]   and your postdocs and graduate students and staff.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.640]   What are the major conclusions and what sorts of directives,
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.540]   if any, emerge from this study?
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.780]   - And I'll just preface this again by saying,
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.300]   if I wasn't clear, some news reports said,
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.140]   ah, this means fiber is not important.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.980]   And then others said, this means fermented foods
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.460]   and fiber are important.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.100]   And others said, fermented foods are the thing
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.360]   and the only thing, it was all over the place.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.940]   And one of the reasons for doing this podcast at all
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.640]   is so that we can go straight to the people
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.900]   who perform the work.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.880]   And even though I'm certainly not an expert in microbiome,
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.260]   give you the opportunity to share with me and me
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.980]   to ask the kinds of questions that have zero agenda.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.820]   I do like sauerkraut.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:25.220]   I do drink the occasional kombucha.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:29.180]   I do like low sugar, not so sweet forms of fermented foods.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.540]   So I would be delighted if fermented foods are good for me,
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.540]   but I have no steak in the fermented food industry.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.860]   - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.700]   - Yeah, great.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.500]   Yeah, wonderful.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.480]   And an important note there is the one you pointed out
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.020]   that this is an incredible collaboration
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.800]   with Christopher Gardner's lab and a bunch of people.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.560]   Erica Sonnenberg helped lead this study
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.460]   and then tons of, like you were saying, post-doc staff
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.800]   and other people at Stanford
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.160]   and then wonderful participants
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.320]   that were part of this study.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.000]   So a huge team effort.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.580]   Before I dive into that study, let me take a step back
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.880]   because I think the reason that we did this study
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   and kind of Christopher's group and our group
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.960]   has started to pursue this line
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.460]   of looking at dietary interventions
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.920]   and how they impact our microbiome,
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.580]   how they impact human biology,
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.820]   goes back to this kind of epiphany
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.580]   that we had while studying the gut microbiome
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.540]   because I think when we started studying it at Stanford,
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.540]   we were thinking about it
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:30.900]   as this kind of newly appreciated aspect of our biology,
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:35.360]   almost like finding an organ that we didn't know was there
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.880]   and starting to think about all the drug targets
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.720]   that were there.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.360]   Can we go in with small molecule drugs
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.600]   and think of ways to manipulate this community
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.260]   to ameliorate disease?
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.360]   And this is largely the mindset of Western medicine
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.300]   and largely born out of the era of infectious disease.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.560]   You wait for an infection to start a bacterial infection,
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.820]   you treat with antibiotics
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:56.840]   and that's the way medicine is practiced
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.760]   and that's become less successful over time
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.000]   as we've moved into this era
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.800]   of inflammatory Western diseases
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.080]   and with the exception of the current pandemic
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.960]   that's sweeping the world,
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.040]   largely moved out of the era of infectious diseases,
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.260]   at least infectious bacterial diseases,
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:21.200]   that this paradigm of waiting for diseases to appear
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:25.000]   and come into the clinic is not really very effective
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.800]   in the context of inflammatory Western diseases,
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.220]   autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome,
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.280]   heart diseases and inflammatory disease.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.880]   The list goes on and on.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.920]   And so we started to think a lot about
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.360]   how can we get out in front of this?
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.240]   How can we think about preventative ways
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.480]   of dealing with this crisis
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.160]   of metabolic and inflammatory diseases?
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.120]   And this tremendous beautiful body of literature
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.920]   started to come forward in the field about 10 years ago
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.880]   that showed that the gut microbiome is absolutely critical
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.720]   to modulating our immune status.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.720]   So if you change the microbiome,
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.420]   you can fundamentally change how the immune system operates.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   And we know that the immune system is at the basis
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:13.460]   of a lot of these diseases, inflammatory, chronic diseases.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.580]   And so it brought up this possibility
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.580]   that maybe the fact that we're not nourishing
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:19.760]   this community well enough,
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.740]   maybe the fact that it's deteriorated over time
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.520]   due to all of the things that go along
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.500]   with an industrialized lifestyle,
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.760]   antibiotics and so forth,
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.660]   maybe we have a microbiome right now
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.140]   in the industrialized world
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.780]   that is setting our immune system at a set point,
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.460]   simmering inflammation that's driving us
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.480]   towards these inflammatory diseases.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.640]   And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could figure out
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   how to use diet specifically,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.980]   but just kind of learn the rules of how to reconfigure
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.840]   both the composition and function of our gut microbiome
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.360]   so that inflammation was different in our bodies
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.540]   so that each one of us was less likely to go on
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.320]   and to develop an inflammatory disease,
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.080]   leading to better longevity and health
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.400]   over the course of our life.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   And so we were studying this actually in mouse models
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.540]   and realizing that we really needed
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.040]   to start doing human studies.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:23.300]   We needed to start studying microbiome in humans.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:25.600]   And because we were studying diet,
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.820]   we knew that this was something
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.080]   we could go in and do right away.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.880]   We didn't have to apply for FDA approval for a drug
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.480]   before we could do a human study.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.280]   We could just start doing human dietary interventions,
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.560]   longitudinally monitoring the immune system
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.000]   and the microbiome and starting to put the pieces together
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.500]   of what is it in diet that can change our microbiome
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.240]   in a healthy way, help us define what a healthy microbiome is
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.360]   and monitor the immune system in great detail.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.820]   And so there were really two critical components of this
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.120]   in addition to our microbiome expertise.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.560]   One was Christopher Gardner's group.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.520]   We wanted to do these human studies,
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.040]   but we're absolutely terrified of humans.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.640]   We work with mice, humans are terrifying in many ways.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.760]   - But they house themselves.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.040]   You don't have to pay for their housing.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:10.880]   - That's true, yeah.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.880]   - For those that can afford housing, of course, yeah.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.600]   - Yeah, sadly, just for that portion of the population.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.240]   So Christopher's group,
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.940]   they are masters at working with human populations.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:24.440]   And then the other wonderful thing that we have at Stanford
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.720]   is this Human Immune Monitoring Center
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.640]   run by Mark Davis and Holden Maker.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.840]   They started this beautiful center
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.320]   for allowing people to do immunology in humans.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.740]   Critical element because a lot of the mouse studies
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.140]   don't translate well to humans.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.040]   So if you can do the studies in humans,
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.600]   similar to how we were thinking about the microbiome,
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.920]   you learn something that you know is relevant to humans.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.000]   And so having that immune profiling capability
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.240]   where we can monitor hundreds to thousands
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.360]   of different parameters in the immune system,
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.040]   longitudinally in people from a blood draw,
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.440]   and not just know if CRP goes up
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.500]   or if interleukin-6 goes up or down,
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.400]   but to be able to see all these facets
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.280]   of the immune system change in concert
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.480]   as we're changing the microbiome with diet
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.400]   was really a key component of this.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.040]   And so our flagship study supported by wonderful donors,
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.320]   so this actually isn't funded by typical foundations
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.560]   and national institutes of health,
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.440]   it was funded by philanthropy.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.120]   We wanted to understand
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.000]   if we put people on a high fiber diet,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.240]   how would that affect their microbiome and immune system?
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.720]   And if we put them on a high fermented food diet,
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.600]   a diet rich in live microbes and all the metabolites
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.320]   that are present from fermentation and foods,
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.520]   how would that change microbiome and immune system?
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.600]   - Could you give us some examples
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.720]   of what those diets look like?
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.000]   And were you changing their basal diet
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.480]   or were you just adding things on top
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.520]   of what they were already eating?
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.560]   - So-
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.360]   - 'Cause it's hard to change people's diets.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.200]   - It's very hard.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.680]   - And you have to trust that they actually do it
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.000]   and they're not sneaking and-
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.960]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.840]   And so we, and we've started
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.000]   the Center for Human Microbiome Studies at Stanford
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.600]   for doing a lot of these studies.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.760]   And a portion of the studies we do focus on supplements,
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.940]   probiotics, microbes delivered in pill form,
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.880]   prebiotics, which are purified forms of fiber.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.600]   And in those cases, we actually can have placebo groups
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.340]   because it's more like a drug study
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:22.120]   and we don't change people's diets,
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.880]   so we can just administer this on top of what they're doing.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.800]   So in a way they're a lot more controlled,
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.320]   but it's not food.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.040]   When you start doing food studies,
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.520]   you can't do a placebo group
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.040]   'cause people know what they're eating.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:37.960]   And the other problem is that it's really hard
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.440]   to just change one thing
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.720]   because as soon as you start adding something,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.560]   people usually eliminate something else.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.880]   So the idea was to basically give these people
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.680]   simple instructions for, in the case of the high fiber diet,
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.400]   just increasing plant-based fiber.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.000]   So can you eat more whole grains,
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.600]   more legumes, more vegetables, nuts,
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.460]   get the fiber up in the range of from 15 to 20 grams per day
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:04.380]   up to over 40 grams per day.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.580]   So can you kind of double or more the amount of fiber
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.160]   that you eat per day,
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.280]   knowing that that would have a tremendous impact
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.080]   on a lot of other facets of their diet.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:20.080]   They eat less meat, animal-based protein,
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.860]   less animal-based fats as a product of this.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.580]   I will say that getting back to Christopher's rule
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.320]   for a healthy diet,
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.900]   a lot of the macronutrient changes that we saw in their diet
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:38.000]   were consistent with healthy changes in diet,
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.160]   less saturated fat, less animal-based protein,
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.600]   more plant-based protein.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.720]   So a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.660]   kind of came in concert with just telling people
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:52.520]   eat a high fiber diet, high plant-based fiber diet.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:57.340]   The people that were eating the high fermented food diet,
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.880]   they were instructed to basically eat
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:04.720]   foods that you could buy at a grocery store
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.920]   that were naturally fermented and contain live microbes.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.760]   And so this largely consisted of yogurt,
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, some fermented vegetables,
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.140]   kind of brined fermented vegetables, pickles,
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   things like that.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:25.620]   But one of the things that I think is a pitfall
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:28.640]   in choosing fermented foods is you can go down
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.760]   the canned food aisle and there's this huge section
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.420]   of pickles and jars that are canned.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.280]   Those are not fermented foods.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.480]   Those are cucumbers that they've put in,
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.560]   acetic acid and vinegar to reconstitute
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.040]   that fermented flavor,
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.640]   but there's no live microbes involved in that.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.920]   And even sauerkrauts in the canned food aisle,
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.740]   even if they were naturally fermented,
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.580]   quite often they're not.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.120]   Quite often, they're just brined in vinegar.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.000]   But even if they are naturally fermented,
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.800]   all of the microbes are killed prior to canning
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.400]   or during the process of canning.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.780]   And so if you want to, so what we use for this study,
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.680]   and if you want to have live fermented foods
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.900]   that contain live microbes,
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:10.060]   you need to buy those out of the refrigerated section,
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:10.900]   essentially.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.240]   - And I'm really glad you pointed this out
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.240]   because you can find sauerkraut
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:20.120]   on the non-refrigerated shelf that is indeed non-fermented.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:23.800]   A lot of fermented foods that are available in the US
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.720]   can be high in sugar.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.960]   So was there any instruction as to getting people
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.320]   to make sure that they were consuming yogurts
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.720]   that weren't loaded with sugar,
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.320]   or did you let them just select
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.840]   for the stuff in the cold section that is fermented?
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.480]   - No, it's a super important point.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.120]   We instructed people to eat non-sweetened yogurts.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.280]   I think a huge pitfall in this area
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.640]   is you can have a yogurt loaded with bacteria,
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.640]   kind of the base of what's healthy,
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.040]   and then a ton of artificial flavoring and sugar
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.020]   loaded on top of that.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.940]   Manufacturers put a ton of sugar in after the fact
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.480]   to kind of mask the sour taste of fermented foods,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.400]   which is hard for some people to become accustomed to.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.900]   When we were switching to more fermented foods,
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.680]   our daughters were young at that point,
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.600]   we would take plain yogurt,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.080]   which they didn't like, just kind of neat.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.120]   We would mix in a little maple syrup or honey,
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:20.960]   just a little bit,
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.160]   and gradually we reduced that over time
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.640]   to the point where they're palate adjusted
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.620]   and now they just really like plain yogurt.
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:33.240]   But I think getting used to that sour flavor is difficult,
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.100]   but people really should try to stay away
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.800]   from those fermented foods that are loaded with sugar,
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.160]   and that's what we instructed people in the study.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.040]   - And beer was not included, right?
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.520]   There were a number of people that asked
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.840]   when I did a brief thing on social media about this study,
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.680]   and hopefully I got it right, I think I did,
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.200]   but people just ask about beer.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.060]   I'm not a drinker, so for me, beer has no appeal anyway,
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:00.080]   but beer is fermented, correct?
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.200]   But were they instructed to avoid beer or to drink beer?
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.320]   - Just to go with their normal dietary habits,
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.840]   but that did not count as a fermented food.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.200]   - And kombucha was, as I recall.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.320]   - Kombucha was, and kombucha can have small amounts
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   of alcohol in it, but kombucha actually was one
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.760]   of the major things that people consumed
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.400]   during the fermented food phase.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.400]   And the deal with beer is that there may be
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.920]   beneficial properties of the microbial communities
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.160]   in naturally fermented beer,
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.720]   but most of the beer that we buy, again,
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.120]   is canned and filtered and there's no live microbes there.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.640]   So very different than if you siphon it off of your home brew
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:44.520]   and drink it probably than if you buy it in a store.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.360]   - I will get to the results of the study in just one moment,
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.640]   but I want to say a lot of people shy away
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.980]   from the high quality fermented foods
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.520]   because they can be quite costly.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.700]   I'll just refer people to a resource in Tim Ferriss' book,
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.760]   "The 4-Hour Chef."
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.400]   He actually gives an excellent recipe
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.640]   for making your own sauerkraut,
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:06.560]   which basically involves cabbage and water and salt,
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.040]   but you have to do it properly
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.680]   because you can grow some, not necessarily lethal,
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.920]   but some somewhat dangerous bacteria
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.080]   if you don't scrape off the top layer properly.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.480]   But he gives beautiful instructions
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.880]   for how to do this in vats.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.800]   We've started doing this at home now, actually,
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:22.760]   which is a ceramic vat.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.240]   And so you can make large amounts
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.800]   of truly fermented sauerkraut just from cabbage,
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.920]   water, and salt, if you're willing to follow the protocol.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.060]   And if you're interested in science,
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.020]   that protocol looks a lot like what you'll do
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.880]   for most of your graduate career,
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.840]   except maybe some sequencing too.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.680]   So anyway, just to refer people to a source
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.520]   that's very low cost compared to buying
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:43.700]   the high quality fermented foods.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.640]   Even kombucha's, for some people,
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.600]   it's like $5 a bottle, only this much.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.680]   And if you consume liquids the way I consume them,
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.580]   that's just the start.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.920]   - But if you can get your hands on a scoby,
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.760]   kombucha's another one that's super simple.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.800]   - You can grow your own.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.040]   - You can just make your own and it's super easy to do.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.080]   I constantly have a batch of kombucha going at home
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.520]   and it's just a scoby, a symbiotic community
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.320]   of bacteria and yeast that you brew tea,
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.600]   you add sugar to it, and you put the scoby in
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.240]   and you wait a week or two, depending upon the temperature.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:22.880]   And then you just move the scoby over to a new batch
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.560]   and what the scoby was in is kombucha and it's wonderful.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.400]   - I love it.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.680]   I would love it if members of this audience
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.800]   would start to make their own kombucha and sauerkraut.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.080]   I've been having so much fun.
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:37.320]   Well, I don't do it, but it's done in our home.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.520]   I don't go anywhere near the food production
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.160]   and it's for everyone's benefit.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:46.680]   So how much fermented food and then were they consuming?
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.880]   'Cause you mentioned the number of grams approximately
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.880]   of fiber, but was it in servings, ounces,
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.480]   how many times a day, early day, late day?
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:00.800]   - Right, yeah, so we had a wonderful dietician
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.680]   instructing people for this and her name's Dahlia Perlman
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.480]   and she really was the key and is the key
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:06.880]   for many of our studies for getting people
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.200]   to eat differently.
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:11.840]   And the general instructions were for people
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.800]   to eat as much fermented foods as possible, more is better.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:18.080]   And the reason is that with this initial study,
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:21.260]   we really wanted to maximize our chance of seeing a signal
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:23.880]   if there was something biological going on
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.640]   with the idea that if the dose was excessive
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.280]   and not easily achievable by a lot of people in the end,
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.080]   we can go back and say, okay, this is the point
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.280]   at which we lose the biological signal.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.680]   But people during the height of the intervention phase,
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.840]   the intervention phase was six weeks.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.200]   During the height of that, we're up over six servings
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.280]   on average per day of fermented foods,
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.640]   so kind of two servings at each meal.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.600]   And the ounces or weight or size,
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.280]   it really depended on what the fermented food was
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.400]   and we just told them to stick to what was a recommended dose
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.940]   on the package that they were buying.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:05.360]   For kombucha, it'd be like a six to eight ounce glass,
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.560]   sauerkraut, like a half cup or something like that
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.720]   and the same with yogurt.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.560]   - Great, so what were the results?
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.160]   - Yeah, so the results astounded us in a way,
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:21.160]   but then thinking more deeply and it'll be evident
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:24.680]   even after I explain it in the context of this conversation,
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:27.720]   likely why we saw the results we saw.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:28.840]   The results were astounding
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:32.040]   because our hypothesis going into this
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.940]   was that the high fiber diet
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.600]   was going to give the massive signal.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.160]   We know that this is the big deficiency
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.240]   in the Western diet.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.480]   All the mouse studies have told us that high fiber
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.320]   really leads to a much healthier microbiota,
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.080]   can lead to positive changes in the immune system.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.200]   And in fact, even when we had a limited,
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.480]   we had wonderful donor support,
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.760]   but still a limited amount of money
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760]   when we started this study,
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.160]   my lab was really very eager to do the high fiber
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.280]   part of this really well.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.560]   And Christopher kind of had to twist our arms
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.640]   to do the fermented food side of it.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.360]   And we thought it was kind of quirky and neat,
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.880]   like live microbes should be exciting, like let's try it.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.920]   So we put that in and it turns out
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.560]   that we were very thankful that he twisted our arms
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.440]   because it was that high fermented food arm
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.120]   that really gave us the big signal,
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.900]   even though our hypothesis was that the high fiber
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.120]   was gonna lead to more short chain fatty acids
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.180]   produced in the gut, more diverse microbiota,
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:31.420]   less inflammation in the immune system.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:33.500]   We didn't see that across the cohort.
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:37.040]   We actually saw very individualized responses
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.520]   to the dietary fiber.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.760]   And I'll come back to what those responses were.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.200]   The big signal really was in the fermented food group.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.880]   We saw all the things that you would hope to see
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.800]   in a Western microbiota and Western human.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.400]   We saw this increase in microbiota diversity
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.700]   over the course of the six weeks
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:56.300]   while they were consuming the fermented foods.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:34:01.300]   And we can't always say that higher diversity is better
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.320]   when it comes to our microbial communities.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.240]   We know there are cases, for instance, bacterial vaginosis,
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.340]   where higher diversity is actually indicative
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.320]   of a disease state.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.620]   But we know in the context of the gut
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.880]   and for people living in the industrialized world,
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.680]   higher diversity is generally better.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.420]   We know that there's a spectrum of diversity.
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:24.520]   People with higher diversity generally are healthier.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.180]   If you can push your diversity higher,
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:27.320]   you're in better shape.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.640]   And so we saw that increase in diversity.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.400]   And then the major question is what happened
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.340]   to the immune system as these people
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.640]   were increasing their gut microbiota diversity
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.100]   through the fermented foods.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.520]   So we did this massive immune profiling
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:45.040]   and we see a couple dozen immune markers,
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.960]   inflammatory markers decrease over the course of the study.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   So we measure these at multiple time points
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   throughout the course of the study.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.800]   And there's kind of this stepwise reduction
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:00.200]   in things like interleukin-6 and interleukin-12,
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.800]   a variety of kind of famous inflammatory mediators.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.260]   And then even if you go into the immune cells
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:08.780]   and you start looking at their signaling cascades,
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.120]   we see that those signaling cascades are less activated
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.980]   at the end of the study compared to the beginning
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:17.000]   of the study indicating an attenuation of inflammation.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.680]   So kind of exactly what we would hypothesize
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.460]   would lead to less propensity
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.780]   for inflammatory disease over time.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.160]   That's a huge extension of a very short study.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.460]   - How long was the study again?
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:33.960]   - So the complete protocol I think was 14 to 17 weeks
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.080]   or something like that.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.880]   The actual intervention phase consisted of a four-week ramp
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.320]   and then a six-week maintenance period.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:43.240]   So the intervention itself was 10 weeks,
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.760]   but there were six weeks of really kind of hardcore
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.800]   high levels of fiber or fermented foods.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.220]   - Yeah, and I'm glad you've mentioned the ramp
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:53.840]   'cause my experience with fermented foods
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.600]   is that it can be beneficial to give the system
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.780]   an opportunity to acclimate.
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:01.100]   I mean, if you consume a giant bowl of sauerkraut,
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.100]   it's not gonna be the worst day and night of your life,
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.560]   but you'll know you did.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.520]   We'll just leave it at that.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.400]   And so you want to kind of acclimate to it.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.360]   I'm at the point now where some people
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.240]   might think this is gross,
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.160]   but after I exercised, I've been sweating a lot,
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.680]   I like the saltiness of the...
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.760]   I actually drink the liquid
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.960]   that the sauerkraut has been stewing in.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.360]   And I like to think that I consume
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.760]   some fermentation that way.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.860]   It's salty, it acts as kind of a post-training replenishment.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:34.440]   But if I had done that six months ago straight off,
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:36.320]   I think it would have been pretty rough on my system.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.920]   I started taking little bits of it
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.080]   and then adding it each day.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:39.920]   - Totally.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.560]   And so both with the fermented foods and the fiber,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.400]   it's well known that this kind of gradual ramping
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.080]   is a really important way of mitigating bloating
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.360]   and other kind of digestive discomfort
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.680]   that can happen when your microbiome reconfigures
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.560]   and starts fermenting more and changing community members.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.640]   So you should take that ramp at your own pace.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.200]   If something seems to be going wrong,
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.640]   just kind of level off, stay there.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.500]   You know, we did this in a very delicate way
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.120]   to get people up to the high dose.
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.120]   The brine question, just a tangent here for a second.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.580]   That was actually one of the products
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:16.780]   that we had people use in the fermented food phase.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:18.580]   There's actually a product called Gut Shots,
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.960]   which is just the brine that they've marketed.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.440]   We actually are now studying it in the lab.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.280]   I just actually, before this came from a lab meeting
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.280]   where a GI fellow in my lab is actually putting Gut Shots,
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.280]   sterilized gut microbes or the fermentation microbes
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:40.920]   removed or present into mice
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:44.300]   and looking at changes in their mucosal immune system.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.100]   So we're studying this in detail now
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.820]   because it's a rich source of lactate
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:51.100]   and a bunch of other interesting metabolites.
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.460]   - I love that my weird behavior
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:56.500]   is inadvertently being studied at Stanford Medicine.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.400]   I want to just mention something about the Gut Shots.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.120]   Those are sold as a drink.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.540]   Those also, just for certain listeners in different budgets,
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.740]   they can be very expensive if you really think about,
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.760]   some of them are exceedingly expensive,
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:13.400]   but what I described before with making your own kombucha,
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.800]   it's not quite brining, but the homemade sauerkraut,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.500]   that protocol is out there, as I mentioned,
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.880]   in Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef,"
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.740]   and you get a lot of the brining
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.820]   from that, an almost endless amount.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:28.480]   A cautionary note, I once went into the refrigerator
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.320]   and saw something similar to Gut Shot, it wasn't Gut Shot,
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.860]   and I drank the whole 12-ounce bottle
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:36.180]   and realized that it was 24 servings.
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.340]   And that's where I got my initial experience
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.300]   with what it is to not do a ramp-up phase.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:43.140]   I do not recommend doing that.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:45.360]   Some of these, it's very potent, it seems,
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.940]   and you can consume even a half an ounce or an ounce.
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.760]   - Yeah, I mean, very potent
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.100]   from the standpoint of fermentation, but also very salty.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:55.060]   So there's a lot of effects that can, yeah.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.300]   - Don't do what I do, at least not at the outset.
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:02.940]   But so that is an experienced warning.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:05.700]   So they did this, as I recall, there was a swap condition
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:08.740]   or there was a halt condition, so you did controls, right?
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.100]   It wasn't just comparing groups.
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:13.060]   You had individuals who were initially in one group
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:16.180]   or the other move to a different group.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.700]   - Well, so we- - Or stop and then return.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.620]   - Yeah, we actually just did a stop
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.300]   and followed them during a washout phase.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.940]   And the ideal situation for dietary interventions like this
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:30.140]   are to do crossover studies, as you're suggesting.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.940]   We've recently completed
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:34.420]   a ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet intervention-
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:35.900]   - So are those data published yet?
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.380]   - Not yet, but Christopher's been tweeting
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.260]   a lot of these data,
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.780]   and there's a paper in revision right now.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:43.220]   So if you go to Christopher Gardner's Twitter feed,
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.780]   you'll be able to find him reporting
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.460]   some of the early results of this study.
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:50.600]   - Can you give us a snippet of, was there a superior,
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.680]   just give us, you don't have to tell us which one,
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.800]   but was there a superior condition
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.780]   of either Mediterranean versus ketogenic?
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:02.500]   - So the metabolic effects of these, it's a beautiful study.
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.420]   I should let his group comment on that.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.280]   The microbiota data, we actually are just generating now.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.940]   So the study that his group has put together from this
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:14.300]   is largely independent of the microbiota data,
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.140]   and now we're doing a more in-depth analysis,
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:17.980]   and I'll have more to say about that in the future.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:19.420]   - We'll return to that, yeah.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.700]   - But it's a super exciting study
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:24.480]   because it is one of these where people eat a certain way.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.340]   And what's really beautiful about this
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:29.660]   is we even got food delivered for part of the intervention.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:32.900]   So we had complete control over what they at least
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.420]   had available to eat.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:39.420]   And then the second phase, they make the food on their own,
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:43.580]   and then we cross over and do the same thing.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.540]   And so that's really like the,
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.100]   if you have a good enough budget,
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.260]   the right way to do a study like this.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:51.720]   For this, we didn't have the time or money
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.460]   to do a crossover, but we did do a washout phase
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:57.580]   where people, we didn't make them stop eating whatever,
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:59.340]   if they were enjoying it, but we monitored,
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.620]   and there was some recidivism where there was a decrease
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.100]   in fiber fermented food.
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.820]   And we could see, for instance,
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:06.860]   diversity start to plateau and reverse
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.100]   in many of these people.
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:11.420]   So there does appear to be like a need for maintenance
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:15.980]   of the intervention to maintain the perceived health benefits
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.220]   that we were measuring.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:20.240]   - Great, we will provide a link to the study in the caption.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.860]   And thank you for that very clear and thorough description
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:27.620]   from one of the investigators involved in the study.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.500]   It's great to go direct to the source.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:34.780]   Anecdotally, were there improvements in mood,
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.420]   in resistance to colds and infection
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.820]   during the course of the study?
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:43.140]   And this is kind of a prelude to where I'm headed next,
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:45.280]   which is there is a tremendous amount of interest
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.620]   in the so-called gut brain access,
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.220]   but also I want to make sure that we talk about
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:52.260]   how these microbes and the conditions they're establishing
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:55.880]   in the gut are creating positive or negative health effects.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.260]   I mean, basically how signals get out of the gut.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.100]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.580]   - I certainly noticed that when I'm eating
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.660]   more fermented foods or there's probiotics
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:06.860]   in drinks I consume and so forth that I feel,
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:08.760]   quote unquote, air quotes, completely subjective,
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.840]   I feel better.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.780]   I wish there was an objective measure of feeling better,
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.300]   but I seem to think more clearly,
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.720]   sleep better, mood, et cetera.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.480]   And I know I'm not alone in that.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.240]   And people, and anytime I've taken harsh antibiotics,
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.060]   I feel worse, but then again, I'm usually taking them
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.060]   because I'm feeling bad about something else, right?
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.700]   I don't take them just because.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:33.540]   So did people say they were feeling better in any way?
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:34.940]   And if so, what did you observe?
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:38.060]   And again, we're highlighting these as antic data.
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.060]   - Yeah, totally.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:43.080]   You know, we, as part of this effort
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:48.140]   to look at how dietary interventions affect our health
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:51.540]   and wellbeing and so forth and microbiome and immune system,
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.840]   we interact with a lot of people who have like read our book
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.620]   or kind of have become microbiome enthusiasts
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.880]   and have implemented a lot of these changes
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.720]   in their personal life.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:04.880]   And I hear the same thing that you're saying, Andrew,
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.660]   that tons of people say they have more energy,
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.760]   they think more clearly, they sleep better,
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.840]   their family is nicer to each other,
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.640]   like the number of crazy things.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.560]   And it's really hard to uncouple like,
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.580]   is this because these people have taken charge now
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:20.440]   of what they're eating and just feel better in general
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:23.240]   for being in control of kind of what they're doing?
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.700]   Or is there this cascading set of effects
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:31.040]   that are actually impacting or kind of emanating
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.400]   from the gut brain axis?
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.780]   And so we actually implemented a bunch of questionnaires
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:40.560]   and even a cognitive test to try to get at some of this.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.020]   And I should say, the list of this goes on and on.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:46.300]   There are people who claim that their complexion improves
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.100]   and that their allergies,
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:50.280]   and there's probably all sorts of ripple effects.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.880]   If you can affect your inflammation,
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.720]   we know that you can affect your cognition.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.960]   We know that you can affect your skin
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.960]   and inflammation that's occurring on your skin.
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:02.800]   So I really think that there is a basis
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.640]   for a lot of those anecdotes.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:07.780]   It may just be hard to see in a short study
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:11.840]   and in a small cohort of people
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.120]   over a short period of time.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.400]   But we didn't really see significant things
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:21.720]   associated with cognition and moods and all of the things
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.360]   that we were testing for, which yeah,
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:28.000]   there could be a variety of explanations for that.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000]   We also have a standardized stool measure that people use,
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.160]   and there was kind of less constipation,
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.160]   better bowel movements over the course
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.320]   of both of these interventions.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.220]   So it did seem like bowel habits improved,
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.760]   which a lot of times can lead to better moods,
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.120]   but that we weren't able to measure that.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.240]   - The classic psychoanalyst would have a field day with that.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:55.800]   What sorts of interesting things did you observe
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.620]   in the fiber group?
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.040]   Because it's clear that that group yielded
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.520]   some unexpected findings in both directions.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.360]   Things you expected to see, you didn't see
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.160]   as to the same amplitude as you did
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.280]   in the fermented food group,
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.800]   but I'm guessing you also saw some very interesting things
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.240]   in the fiber group.
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.080]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.840]   So we started looking at the data in more detail
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.840]   when we didn't see the cohort-wide response.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.200]   And one of the things we observed is that
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:22.040]   in measuring all these immune parameters,
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.640]   there appeared to be three different groups
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.200]   of kind of immune responses that we were seeing.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.280]   One group that got overall less inflammatory,
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.640]   and then two other groups that kind of had a mixed result,
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.120]   partly more inflammatory, partly less inflammatory
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.140]   in all these markers that we were looking at.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:43.360]   And when we started digging into like what aspect
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.360]   of the biology of those people dictated or predicted
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:52.040]   which group they fell into, the really interesting part
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:55.280]   is the people with the highest diversity gut microbiomes
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:59.240]   to start the study were the ones that were most likely
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.520]   to have the decreases in inflammation.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:07.800]   And so the data seemed to be telling us
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.480]   that if you start off with a diverse microbiota,
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.760]   maybe one that's better equipped to degrade
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:16.680]   a wide variety of dietary fiber,
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.960]   you're more likely to respond positively to it.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.440]   If you have a very depleted gut microbiome,
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.440]   you're not as likely to be able to respond to it.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.960]   And thinking back to that experiment
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:27.520]   that we talked about before with the multi-generational
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.120]   loss of fiber-fermenting microbes in mice
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.320]   that were fed a Western diet,
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.400]   it may be that many of us in the industrialized world
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:41.000]   have a microbiome that's so depleted now
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.960]   that even if we consume a high fiber diet,
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.600]   at least for a short period of time,
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600]   we don't have the right microbes in our gut
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.860]   to degrade that fiber.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:50.760]   And this has actually been observed by other groups,
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.080]   beautiful study out of University of Minnesota
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:55.880]   looking at immigrants coming to the United States.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:59.080]   And within nine months, but certainly over the course
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.840]   of years, immigrants that come here lose a lot
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.640]   of the diversity in their gut microbiome,
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.480]   but a lot of the fiber degrading capacity in their gut
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.300]   microbiome too.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.040]   So it could be that over time,
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.760]   this becomes a one-way street and it's hard for us
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:18.000]   to recover the microbes that actually can degrade the fiber.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.020]   And I think that this probably intersects with sanitation
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:23.780]   in our environment and the fact that we don't have access
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:27.180]   to new microbes that might help us degrade the fiber,
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.420]   that we actually have lost these microbes
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.760]   and they're in some ways, irrecoverable
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.440]   without deliberate reintroduction
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.840]   of fiber degrading microbes.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.940]   - I can recall from childhood,
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:40.540]   there were kids that would eat dirt and snails
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:42.560]   and stuff that just sounds totally disgusting,
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.560]   but kids covered with mud and that maybe not so much anymore.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.260]   And certainly during the pandemic,
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:52.120]   there's been a lot more use of these hand sanitizers
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.360]   that prior to that, people seemed pretty spooked about,
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.500]   but then obviously they prioritize them.
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.400]   So do you, while you have children,
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.880]   did you encourage them to,
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.760]   when they were young, did you encourage them to interact
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:09.960]   with pets and dirt and stuff in the environment,
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.080]   provided that stuff wasn't immediately toxic?
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:12.900]   - Exactly.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.400]   So this is really, it's a continual cost benefit analysis.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.240]   I think I will say that with the pandemic now
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.720]   and certainly just with infectious diseases in general,
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:30.640]   it's really important to be aware of the possibility
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.280]   for compromising your health through the spread of germs.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.040]   And so that is just, hand-washing is important
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.260]   and we have to be careful with the spread of germs.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:45.260]   But I do think that the sanitization of our environment
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:52.380]   has gone overboard with various things being impregnated
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:55.740]   with antibiotics, shopping carts and things like that
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:59.240]   and toothbrushes and it's like antibiotics
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.960]   and things for killing microbes are everywhere.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.100]   And when we were raising, when our daughters were young
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:10.280]   and we were making these decisions,
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.100]   the calculations that we would make were really one,
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:19.080]   how likely are they to encounter a disease-causing microbe?
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:22.640]   If we've been out on a hike or in our garden,
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.840]   just kind of working in the dirt or whatever,
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:26.880]   maybe it's not as important to wash your hands
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.800]   before you have lunch,
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.880]   even if there's a little bit of dirt on them.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.480]   If they've been in a public playground
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:34.700]   where maybe there's other kids with germs
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:37.220]   or maybe even chemicals like pesticides
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.360]   and herbicides that are being used,
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.840]   maybe it's more important than to wash your hands.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.680]   Certainly if you've been in the grocery store
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.840]   or on the subway, probably a good idea to wash your hands.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.160]   So I think you really need to think
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.120]   about kind of the context of it.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.200]   Exposure to microbes from the environment
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.120]   is likely an important part of educating our immune system
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:02.140]   and keeping the proper balance in our immune system.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.920]   And it's just a matter of figuring out
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.620]   the right way to do that safely.
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:08.180]   And it may be that the fermented food result that we saw
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:10.420]   is a way of tapping into those same pathways,
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:13.400]   kind of an environmental exposure to microbes that's safe.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.740]   - Interesting.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:17.920]   I'd like to touch on how signals get from the gut
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:19.020]   to the rest of the body.
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:22.700]   And we probably don't have time to go into all the systems
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.960]   that benefit from having a diverse microbiome
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.320]   or a healthy microbiome,
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.900]   but we talked about the immune system.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.960]   There's active signaling and transport from the gut
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:34.620]   all along its length, as far as I know,
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:37.040]   into the bloodstream and to other organs and tissues.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:41.600]   So for the immune system, it seems straightforward.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.200]   You can reduce the amount or number of inflammatory cytokines
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.520]   like IL-6 and so forth,
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:49.080]   maybe increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.640]   like IL-10 and others.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.080]   But we know there's a gut brain access in neurons
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.860]   that literally talk in both directions
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:57.160]   between brain and gut.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:59.840]   But let's say I'm eating my fermented foods,
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:03.340]   I'm doing all the right things and my gut is diverse
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:06.420]   and I have all the goodies at all the right places.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:11.420]   How is it that the fact that those microbiota are thriving
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.840]   is conveyed to the rest of the body?
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:16.240]   Because they're in there doing their thing
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:17.980]   and I don't know that they have a mind,
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:19.940]   but they're probably not thinking of taking care of me,
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.480]   Andrew, but I get feel better
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:25.080]   or I might get sick less often
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:27.920]   or combat any illness more quickly.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.740]   How is that actually happening?
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.480]   I mean, is it that the microbiota
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.740]   stay restricted to the gut,
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:38.440]   but the signaling molecules are all in a downstream way
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.600]   are making good or bad things happen?
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.440]   Or is there some sort of direct recognition
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.840]   at the body level or are there cells in the body
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.640]   that are responding to, ah, the gut microbiome is healthy
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.520]   and therefore I can make more of the good stuff
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.280]   and less of the bad stuff, so to speak?
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.600]   - Yeah, great.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:57.480]   You're right, it's super complex.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.480]   There's a huge array of ways
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:03.440]   that our body perceives both the microbes
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:05.940]   and the molecules that they produce in our gut
[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:08.320]   and the molecules they produce are of course a product
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.420]   of what microbes are there
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:12.360]   and then what they receive as kind of metabolic inputs,
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.360]   what we're eating and what other microbes
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.600]   are present in the environment providing molecules to them.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.520]   So, it's this complex matrix,
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:24.040]   but probably the simplest place to start
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.280]   is just the immune system.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:29.400]   We have an immune system that the vast majority
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.760]   of immune cells in our body are located in our gut
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:35.760]   just because there's such a dense population of microbes
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.760]   there that have, we consider them beneficial microbes,
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.560]   but they're only beneficial
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.080]   if they're in the right spot in the gut.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.800]   As soon as they mislocalize,
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.760]   we know that they can become opportunistic pathogens.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:51.880]   And so, the immune system really playing an important role
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:56.300]   to keep them in place is essential for the system
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.960]   not moving into a disease space.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:01.160]   The immune system has a variety of ways
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.160]   of monitoring what microbes are there.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:06.160]   There are actually specialized structures in the gut
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:10.860]   known as Peyer's patches that actually take up microbes.
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:14.360]   They actually allow microbes to transit
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:19.360]   into this population of immune cells in a very controlled way
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:23.720]   so that that set of immune cells becomes educated
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.040]   as to what microbes are just on the other side
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:26.880]   of the barrier.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.880]   - Wow, it's kind of like a border patrol.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.880]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.420]   So, they bring them in, they fingerprint them,
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:38.420]   and then have kind of this set of responses
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:41.360]   ready to go if needed.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.360]   - Amazing.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.960]   - There are other cells known as dendritic cells,
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.760]   special types that actually send long arms,
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:51.640]   these processes out into the lumen of the gut
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.960]   and do the same thing, take up microbes,
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:56.120]   bring them back in and sample them.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:59.160]   In addition to these direct sampling mechanisms,
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:03.040]   the cells that line the gut have a huge array of receptors,
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:06.760]   specialized proteins that perceive patterns
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.120]   that the molecular patterns that the microbes make.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.600]   So, things like endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide,
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.720]   just the cell wall of the bacteria.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:19.580]   We have specialized receptors that recognize those.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:21.760]   If those signals become too profound
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.660]   or if they're perceived in the wrong place,
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:26.760]   that can stimulate an inflammatory response.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:29.000]   So, there's all these ways of kind of monitoring
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.080]   the membership and where it is and how close it is,
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.760]   but then there's this whole other set of ways
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.920]   of perceiving metabolic activity
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:38.760]   and what's happening in the gut.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:42.760]   And you mentioned before these cell types
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.200]   that express taste receptors in the gut
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.980]   and have ways of sampling dietary components.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.980]   They're those same types of analogous cells in our gut
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:58.600]   that are perceiving metabolites produced by the microbiota
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.600]   so that our bodies can perceive
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.360]   what sort of metabolic activity is going on.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.780]   And then, in addition to that,
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:10.600]   there's this tremendously important enteric nervous system
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.220]   that's sending signals back to the brain,
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.660]   dictating things like motility.
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.120]   Do I get rid of what's in here?
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.480]   Do I move it along quickly?
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.680]   What actually is happening?
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:23.200]   Do I need to interact with immune cells?
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:27.100]   So, there's this really complex array of interactions
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.460]   between the different cell types.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:31.780]   And then, a lot of the cells that are in the gut
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:33.320]   perceiving all of these signals,
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.120]   a lot of the immune cells can actually get up and leave.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.560]   They can get into the blood, cycle through,
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:44.360]   and then home to other regions of the mucosal surfaces
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:48.460]   so that mucosal surfaces are educated broadly
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:51.280]   against what's passing through our gut.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.860]   So, there's a variety of ways of cells communicating.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:00.600]   And then, a lot of the molecules that the microbiota makes
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.100]   can actually make their way into the bloodstream directly.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:08.600]   And so, the array of molecules is still being defined.
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:11.520]   We're trying to figure out what all these chemicals are.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:13.280]   We've mentioned the short chain fatty acids,
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.360]   but those are just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.220]   They're really interesting compounds
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.760]   like indole derivatives and phenols
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.480]   and derived from amino acids metabolized by gut microbes
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.200]   taken up into the bloodstream.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.440]   And then, we further metabolize these.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:33.920]   They become kind of co-microbe host metabolites.
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.180]   And then, they can go on and bind to different receptors
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:40.360]   throughout our body, anywhere our bloodstream has access to
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:43.360]   and start to trigger signaling cascades.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.400]   - Is it known whether or not any of those molecules
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.960]   are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier?
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.720]   Because the hypothesis and the current thinking
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.560]   is that neurotransmitters manufactured in the gut
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.720]   and signaling along the gut-brain axis,
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.560]   literally neurons talking back and forth electrically
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:02.440]   from brain to gut and gut to brain
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.160]   is what regulates things like mood
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.360]   or at least in animal models.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.900]   And there are some emerging human studies improvement
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:11.400]   of symptoms in autism spectrum disorders,
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:12.840]   maybe even in ADHD.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:15.920]   What I'm basically saying here is there is some evidence
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.160]   emerging that improving the gut microbiome
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.600]   can improve outcomes in psychiatric
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.320]   and developmental disorders.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.140]   But what you're telling me is that the microbiota themselves
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:27.920]   are manufacturing chemicals that can make it
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:28.760]   into the bloodstream.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:30.760]   And therefore, I'm asking if those chemicals
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:33.400]   can move from the bloodstream into the brain directly,
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:37.360]   it may not be a gut-brain access via neurons.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.760]   It actually could just be seepage of serotonin
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:42.800]   into the brain or acetylcholine into the brain
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.680]   for that matter.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:44.520]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.520]   And the biology of most of these molecules
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:52.080]   is not well understood,
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.420]   but certainly in like cerebrospinal fluid
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:58.160]   that's been analyzed, you can perceive
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:57:59.540]   these microbial metabolites.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:00.380]   So they are there.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:01.200]   - That's the answer.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.400]   Some of them are getting across the barrier.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.960]   - But so really interesting thing is I think a lot
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:10.280]   of these molecules are, if they're experienced
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.360]   at high enough doses are toxic or have toxic properties.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:17.620]   We know that a lot of these metabolites,
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:19.380]   when they make their way into the bloodstream,
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:21.760]   eventually are excreted through the kidneys and urine.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.840]   So actually we can monitor the metabolism
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:26.260]   that's going on in your gut by actually looking
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:28.220]   at the metabolites that are present in your urine
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.700]   because many of those originated in your gut
[01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:33.060]   from your gut microbes.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:35.360]   But people with kidney disease,
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:39.240]   whose kidneys filtering processes not functioning properly,
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:43.960]   actually build up high levels of many of these metabolites
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:46.040]   into the bloodstream.
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:50.420]   And that can lead to more of these molecules
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:52.760]   making it across the blood-brain barrier.
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:56.060]   And in fact, some of the transporters in the kidney
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:58.420]   that are responsible for shuttling these molecules
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:01.820]   out into urine are also found at the blood-brain barrier
[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:04.560]   for shuttling the molecules back into the bloodstream
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.220]   if they do get across.
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:09.080]   And we know that like mental fog is a big,
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:12.960]   one of the big symptoms of kidney disease potentially
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.260]   because a lot of these metabolites accumulate in blood
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:19.140]   and then make their way across the blood-brain barrier
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:21.380]   into the central nervous system.
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:22.220]   - Amazing.
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.140]   You mentioned mental fog.
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:25.880]   A few years back, there were some reports,
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:30.060]   some scientific reports and as a consequence in the media
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:33.820]   that excessive intake of pill-form probiotics
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:35.540]   could create mental fog.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:37.940]   I don't know if that ever took hold.
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:42.020]   And it raises a general question about pill-form probiotics.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:43.860]   I took them for a few years just thinking
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:45.480]   that would be good for my gut microbiome.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:48.260]   And then I switched to the fermented food thing largely
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:51.660]   as a consequence of the work that you and Chris published.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:55.260]   But what's the thought about probiotics
[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.220]   for the typical person that's not recovering
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:58.900]   from a round of antibiotics
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.100]   or that has been prescribed them?
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:06.380]   I've heard that the species of microbiota
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:10.000]   that they proliferate might not be the species
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.340]   that we want to proliferate,
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.380]   but I've also heard that maybe that doesn't matter.
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.500]   So what's your general stance?
[02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:16.820]   They can be quite expensive also.
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:18.360]   I know I've been talking about expense law today,
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.580]   but I always want to take into account
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:22.340]   that people are showing up to the table
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.940]   with a variety of budgets.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:26.880]   And probiotics are one of the more expensive supplements
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.720]   out there.
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.420]   You can quickly get into the several hundreds of dollars
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:32.520]   per month if you're getting the quote unquote,
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.860]   best quality ones.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.780]   And if they're actually causing brain fog,
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:37.820]   then I'm not sure I'd want to use them.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:38.660]   - No, completely.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.940]   And there's a ton of snake oil out there.
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:41.980]   I mean, there's just, people know that they,
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:45.800]   I think that many of these companies are aware
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.460]   that they can pray off of people's fears
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:50.140]   and get a lot of money from them with absolutely no data
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.580]   to back up that their probiotic is doing anything.
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:56.660]   So I think the first thing to say is buyer beware
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:59.980]   because it's a supplement market, it's largely unregulated.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:02.460]   And that means that there are a lot of bad products
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:05.740]   out there and a lot of products that,
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:07.580]   even though they're not intended to be bad,
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:09.380]   just don't have great quality control.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.020]   There have been several studies that have taken off the,
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:15.680]   over the counter, just kind of off the shelf probiotics,
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.940]   surveyed what's in there based on sequencing
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:22.540]   and shown that what is in there
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:24.300]   does not match what's on the label.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.180]   - And that's true of many supplements
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:27.700]   and unfortunately supplement companies.
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.500]   This is something we get into on the podcast a lot.
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.180]   There are reputable brands
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.340]   and they go through a lot of work to get things right.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:37.820]   And there are many that just, for whatever reason,
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:39.200]   it just doesn't match what's listed.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.040]   - Exactly.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.760]   And so there are places that probiotic companies
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:48.260]   can send their product to have it independently validated.
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:52.500]   So you wanna look for that sort of validation on a product.
[02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:55.460]   There also are names that are just very well-known
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:57.660]   and it's,
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:02.220]   their reputations are on the line.
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:04.140]   So they probably invest a little bit more
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:06.420]   in quality control than maybe some of the
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:08.520]   other lesser known names.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:13.520]   But there's a huge range of data on probiotics
[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:18.460]   and I think the thing that we kind of recommend is
[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:22.920]   try to find good products and then experiment for yourself
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.780]   and see if you can find something that works for you.
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:28.060]   I know people who have experienced constipation
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:31.040]   and don't wanna change their diet
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:33.820]   and have found a probiotic that helps them with that.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:38.440]   If you can find that right mix, great, that's wonderful.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.800]   I would say that the data right now
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.800]   is not overwhelmingly positive for what probiotics
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.560]   do to the gut microbiota.
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.820]   So there have been some nice studies
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:52.960]   looking at the impact of probiotics on recovery
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.240]   after antibiotic treatment and it appears to slow down
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:59.180]   the recovery of the mucosal microbiota.
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:03.280]   And some other studies that have,
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.440]   where the big signal isn't seen, as you might hope,
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.340]   with a probiotic that's supposed to treat
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:10.360]   a different disease.
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.880]   There have been meta-analysis that do suggest
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.040]   in certain instances recovery from antibiotics
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.680]   that there, even though it may cause your microbiota
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:23.040]   to recover more slowly, that it may actually prevent
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:26.360]   diarrheal disease, recovery from viral diarrhea,
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.400]   probiotics may help, but because there's such a huge range
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.360]   of products and because each person is their own
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.680]   little caper when it comes to the microbiome,
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:39.520]   it's really hard to know whether there are great products
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:41.080]   for a given indication.
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.000]   The really good advice that I've heard
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000]   is try to find a study that supports
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.240]   in a really well-designed study,
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:52.400]   and this is very hard for people who aren't scientists
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:56.160]   to evaluate, so if you're experiencing a medical problem
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:00.520]   or wanna consult a doctor, that might be helpful,
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:03.280]   but finding a study where a specific probiotic
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:07.080]   has successfully done whatever it is you're looking for
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.960]   and then sticking with that probiotic is really
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:13.320]   the best recipe as a place to start in this space, I think.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.520]   - And what about prebiotics?
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:17.520]   Is there a number of reasons why I can imagine
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:20.240]   that prebiotics would be beneficial?
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:23.840]   Which essentially, you're pushing the fiber system,
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.080]   which we talked a lot about today.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.000]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000]   You know, the studies that have been done on prebiotics,
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.480]   it's really kind of a mixed bag of results.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:41.120]   There have been studies done with purified fibers
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.720]   where you actually see microbiota diversity plummet
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:46.480]   over the course of the study because you get
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:49.240]   a very specific bloom in a small number of bacteria
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.120]   that are good at using that one type of fiber,
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.300]   and that's at the expense of all the other microbes
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:55.280]   that are in the gut.
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.720]   And so it's really hard to replicate with purified fiber
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:01.720]   what you'd get, for instance, at a salad bar
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:04.720]   in terms of the array of complex carbohydrates
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:06.840]   that you would be exposing your microbiota to.
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:11.840]   And I think the kind of broad view of this in the field
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:17.640]   is that consuming a broad variety of plants
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:21.560]   and all the diverse fiber that comes with that
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:23.640]   is probably better in fostering diversity
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:26.200]   in your microbiota than purified fibers.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:28.920]   Now, there are, again, a lot of people
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.760]   who benefit from purified fibers,
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:34.560]   either for GI motility or for other aspects
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.480]   of GI health problems that they've been experiencing.
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:38.760]   Again, I think it's the type of thing
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:41.000]   where you have to try to find the thing
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.520]   that that's right for you.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:46.400]   But there also are studies that suggest
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:50.920]   that if you layer rapidly fermentable fibers
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:55.480]   on top of a Western diet, you actually can result
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:58.720]   in weird metabolism happening in your liver
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:01.720]   because you have this incredibly rapid fermentation of fiber
[02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:04.760]   along with a lot of fat coming into the system.
[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:06.760]   At least that's the theory.
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:09.840]   And in a mouse study that was published a few years ago,
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:11.880]   they actually see that a subset of the mice
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:14.160]   develop hepatocellular carcinoma
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:18.320]   when they're fed a high dose prebiotic liver cancer
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:21.240]   on top of a Western diet.
[02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.960]   So whether that's representative of human biology,
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:27.160]   we don't know, but purified fibers
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:29.200]   are definitely very different
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.960]   both in terms of the diversity of structures
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:33.560]   but also in terms of how rapidly
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:34.760]   they're fermented in the gut.
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:38.520]   Because if you are eating plants,
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:41.680]   the complex structures there really slow the microbes down
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:43.320]   in terms of fermentation and you end up
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.400]   with a slow rate of fermentation
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:46.880]   over the length of your colon
[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:49.440]   as opposed to this big burst of fermentation
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:52.920]   that can happen if you eat something that is highly soluble
[02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:56.000]   and easily accessed by the microbes.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:56.840]   - Interesting.
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:59.360]   So I guess, is it fair to come back to this idea,
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.280]   try and avoid processed foods,
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.280]   the highly palatable foods,
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.440]   they're all sometimes super highly palatable foods
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:07.080]   they're now called that are packed
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.480]   with hidden sugars, emulsifiers.
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:12.160]   So it sounds like some fiber is good.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:14.000]   And despite the outcome of the study,
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.520]   you identified that if you have the appropriate microbiota,
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:18.480]   then you will background,
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:21.760]   then one will respond even better to the fiber,
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:24.600]   maybe a longer ramp up phase for those folks.
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:26.520]   And then the fermented foods,
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.080]   'cause there's no reason why you can't do both.
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:29.720]   And as we've talked about before,
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:31.840]   a lot of fermented foods have fiber.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:33.760]   So you can kill two birds with one stone.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:36.200]   - Totally, and it could be that the diversity increase
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:38.760]   that we saw in the high fermented food group
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.840]   could be something that would aid the high fiber group.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.320]   And so now we're planning another study coming up
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:46.880]   where we're doing high fiber, high fermented food,
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:48.520]   and then fiber plus fermented food
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.360]   just to see if there's a synergistic effect there.
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:51.960]   - Great, I wanna enroll.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:54.200]   Seriously, although I guess I'm biased
[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.520]   'cause I sort of know where you're trying to,
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.640]   well, is it blood draws that you use
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:00.240]   to measure the inflammatome?
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.880]   - Exactly, so we do blood draws like two weeks.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:04.080]   - So that's good.
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.880]   So you've covered a tremendous amount of information
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.160]   and I'm incredibly grateful.
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:09.880]   This was a area of biology
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:12.260]   that despite having learned a lot about through papers
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:16.240]   and going to talks and reading articles in the media
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:19.120]   has remained somewhat mysterious to me until today.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:20.760]   You've given us a very vivid picture
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:23.480]   of how this system works.
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:24.780]   Where can people find out more
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:26.320]   about the work that you're doing?
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.520]   We can certainly provide links.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:31.580]   And you and your wife who co-run your lab,
[02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:32.980]   you have a book on this topic.
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.060]   So could you tell us about the book
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:36.280]   where we can learn more about the Sonnenberg Lab
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:37.840]   and the work that you're doing?
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.400]   Maybe people will even try and enroll
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:40.320]   in some of these studies.
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.160]   - Yeah, fantastic.
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:43.120]   Yeah, it'd be great if we could get people to enroll.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:47.080]   We're always looking for willing participants.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.800]   Yeah, so Erica, my wife and I wrote a book
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:51.000]   called "The Good Gut."
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.600]   And that really was a response
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:57.100]   to how we were changing our lives
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:58.720]   in response to being in the field,
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:00.700]   being very familiar with the research,
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:01.840]   seeing that a lot of our friends
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.360]   that weren't studying the gut microbiome,
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:06.080]   but were very well-informed, many of them scientists,
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:08.660]   were not doing the same things we were doing.
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:11.840]   And it was very clear that it was just the lack
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:16.180]   of information funneling out of the field to other people.
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:19.160]   And so we wanted to make that accessible
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:21.600]   to people who are not microbiome scientists.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.280]   There's also a really interesting story.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:24.840]   We were at a conference site
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.580]   that just has scientific conferences all summer long,
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:30.040]   week after week after week, different fields.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.680]   And so it's people that work there
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:33.340]   that are just dealing with these new groups
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:34.800]   coming in week after week.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:38.300]   And the week we were there for a microbiome conference,
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:43.160]   people that work in the dining commons came up to us
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:44.520]   and they said, "What group is this?
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:45.360]   This is weird."
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:46.360]   And we're like, "What's weird?"
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.920]   And they said, "We can't keep the salad bar stocked."
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.360]   And it was just, it was very clear
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.120]   that nobody was doing what we were doing
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.020]   until we'd go to a microbiome conference
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:55.920]   and then everybody was doing the same stuff
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:56.920]   that we were doing.
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:59.120]   And so anyway, we wrote this book
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:00.400]   to talk about our personal journey
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.300]   and kind of the science in the field.
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:05.920]   And yeah, just to lay a foundation for people
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.960]   if they wanna start thinking about these changes.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.720]   And then in terms of kind of connecting with our research,
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:14.620]   certainly there's the Center for Human Microbiome Studies
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.660]   at Stanford, which is kind of our home base
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:18.640]   for doing a lot of these dietary interventions.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.400]   We list the studies there,
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:22.440]   give more information on what we're doing.
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:24.240]   And then we have a lab website too
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.380]   that people can go to and read more about our research.
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:29.560]   Yeah, and we're always looking
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.140]   for participants for our studies.
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:32.760]   - Great, well, we will provide links
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.280]   to all of those sources.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:36.520]   And I just wanna say thank you so much
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.540]   for sharing with us your knowledge
[02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:41.200]   for the incredible work that you and Erica,
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:45.760]   your wife and Chris do and are continuing to do.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:48.860]   I think this is an area that when I started my training,
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:51.800]   I heard a little bit about microbiota
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:52.840]   and I always just thought those are people
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:55.380]   that work on infectious disease and like all the bad stuff.
[02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:59.400]   So it's interesting and really important
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.300]   that people realize that we're carrying all this vital cargo
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:03.900]   and we need to take care of the cargo
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.600]   so it can take care of us.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.620]   So thank you so much for your time and for the work you do.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:10.000]   And I hope we can do it again.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:10.840]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.360]   This was a great conversation.
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:13.200]   - Terrific.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:14.040]   Thank you for joining me today
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:16.220]   for my discussion with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg,
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:17.840]   all about the gut microbiome
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.100]   and how to optimize your gut microbiome for health.
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:23.480]   Please check out the Sonnenberg Lab webpage.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:28.480]   That's Sonnenberg spelled S-O-N-N-E-N-B-U-R-G-L-A-B
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.940]   dot Stanford dot E-D-U.
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:34.260]   That's Sonnenberg lab dot Stanford dot E-D-U.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:36.220]   They often recruit for studies
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:38.460]   exploring how different aspects of nutrition
[02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:39.920]   impact the gut microbiome,
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.520]   much as we discussed during today's episode.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.960]   Please also check out the book that he and his wife,
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:47.560]   Dr. Erica Sonnenberg wrote called "The Good Gut."
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.740]   It's readily available on all the usual sites,
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.380]   such as Amazon and so forth.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.660]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:27.340]   mentioned at the beginning of today's episode.
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:30.040]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.200]   We also have a Patreon.
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.960]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.720]   And there you can support the podcast
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.280]   at any level that you like.
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:39.100]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:41.460]   including today, we discuss supplements.
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:44.120]   While supplements are certainly not necessary for everybody,
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:46.420]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:48.240]   for things like sleep and focus,
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:51.160]   and indeed got microbiome support.
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.760]   The one issue with supplements, however,
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:55.200]   is that many of the supplement companies out there
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.520]   do not independently test their supplements.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.400]   So there isn't tremendous confidence in all supplements
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.580]   that they contain the amounts of the ingredients
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:04.840]   that are listed on the bottle
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:07.560]   and that the quality of the ingredients is where it should be.
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:09.300]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne,
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:11.260]   that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:13.300]   because Thorne supplements are known to have
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:15.080]   the very highest levels of stringency
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.120]   with respect to the quality of the supplements
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:21.160]   and the amounts of the supplements listed on their bottles
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.900]   lists what's actually in the containers, which is essential.
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:26.800]   If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:31.800]   you can go to Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:34.360]   and you can get 20% off any of the Thorne supplements
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.400]   that are listed there.
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.680]   Also, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:40.620]   through that portal, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:43.360]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.040]   that Thorne makes.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:46.760]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:49.140]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:52.000]   There I cover topics about science and science-based tools,
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.560]   some of which overlap with the content of this podcast,
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:56.560]   much of which is separate and unique
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:58.360]   from the content of this podcast.
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:13:59.640]   We also have a newsletter.
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:01.540]   It is called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:03.560]   Once a month, we put out short summaries
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:06.240]   of podcast episodes and key takeaways,
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:08.220]   actionable takeaways in particular.
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:10.980]   You can sign up for that by going to hubermanlab.com.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:12.240]   You can look in the menu,
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:13.780]   look for Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:15.660]   You can download previous newsletters
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:18.120]   to take a look at what those are like and about,
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:19.360]   even before signing up.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:20.200]   If you subscribe,
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:22.420]   we don't share your information with anybody.
[02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:25.680]   The privacy policy is made very clear at hubermanlab.com.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:27.220]   So thank you once again for joining me
[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:29.480]   for today's discussion about the gut microbiome.
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:31.840]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:33.540]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:36.120]   [upbeat music]
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:38.700]   (upbeat music)
