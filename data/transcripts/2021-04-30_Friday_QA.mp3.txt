[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Today on Radical Personal Finance is live Q&A. Welcome.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:22.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.840]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Man, it's good to be back on
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.800]   the microphone for a Friday show. I really want these shows to be every single week. Over the
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   last couple of weeks, I have not been able to get it done. So today we kick it off again.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:54.320]   Friday Q&A live call-in show. I'm so glad that you are here for our Friday live Q&A show. If
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.240]   it's your first time, welcome. These shows work just like any other call-in talk radio show. I've
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.720]   got a listener line full of people ready to call in and talk about questions, comments, anything
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.080]   that you have. I open these shows up today to listeners of the show on Patreon. If you would
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.200]   like to gain access to one of these Q&A calls, you'll be able to call in, talk about anything
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.200]   you'd like. I'd be thrilled if you'd go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance. Just search
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.640]   Radical Personal Finance on Patreon. You'll find the page there and I will open these calls up to
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.280]   you. I'd be happy to have you join in for one of these Friday Q&A shows. If you need, I always put
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.720]   timestamps in the description. So if there's a call that you're not interested in, feel free to
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.280]   flip forward to the next timestamp. But I try to keep them interesting and I certainly enjoy doing
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.640]   them because we get to cover all kinds of fascinating topics on a week-by-week basis.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.000]   So I will open up the phone line as soon as I can get my computer to stop playing the music.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.400]   And with a force quit on the music, I think we are ready to go. John in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.800]   You are up first today, sir. Welcome to the show. Thanks, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call. Glad
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.120]   you're feeling better. Thank you. I had two questions. So I'll ask them first one and see
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.840]   if we have time for the second one. But I had some time to start looking into some projects on my
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.480]   list that had been there for a while, specifically about external citizenship outside the US or
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.000]   permanent residency. Specifically, I was looking at citizenship by descent to one of one or two
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.720]   countries in the EU and potential temporary or permanent residency trying to get that in Mexico,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.560]   which I, from what I read, is actually quite easy, but I haven't started taking the steps
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.600]   towards either of those. Citizenship by descent is actually, I'm waiting on some legislation to
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.760]   go through a couple of those countries, which might take quite a while. But as I was thinking
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.560]   about these, I was just wondering, for all the benefits there are for these types of movements,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.760]   are there any downsides to consider when, you know, kind of adding another citizenship
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.800]   for an EU country or even something as simple as a temporary permanent residency for Mexico
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.840]   or anywhere in general? What are the big concerns you would look at for
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.040]   why not to do something like that, if any?
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.840]   - Yeah, the biggest reason why you would not want to pursue a second citizenship or a residency
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.880]   program would be that if you have some personal involvement with the military, you have a top
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.440]   secret clearance of some kind, or you're involved in some kind of governmental function, that can
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.360]   be very, very complicated. It's not illegal to do that, it's just complicated. And it's especially
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.040]   complicated if it's something that you are actively pursuing. So you have a top secret
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.760]   clearance with the US military or you're employed in some kind of government job, and you, you know,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.920]   your mom is from Russia, and so you qualify for Russian citizenship by descent. But now, even
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.480]   after you've worked for the military for 10 years, now you start to go and apply for it, it's just
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.480]   going to make your requalification for your top secret clearance much more complicated. So that,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.400]   I think, is the biggest reason not to do it. Beyond that, if you're not involved with a local
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.040]   government, there are very few downsides. These will vary depending on the country that is involved.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.880]   So the second big reason not to pursue a citizenship is going to be if the country
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   that you're interested in imposes some kind of requirement on you or on your children.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.400]   I think the most important ones here would be things like military service.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   So perhaps you qualify for Israeli citizenship, but by becoming an Israeli citizen,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   your children will be required to do military service in Israel, Singapore, Brazil,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.400]   Armenia. These are all examples of countries that have mandatory military service, and that may
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.640]   affect you or it may affect your children, right? Switzerland would be another example of a famous
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.320]   country that has that. And so do you want to burden your children with the requirement to
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.880]   do military service for what is probably going to be a foreign country for you? Now, there is
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.320]   a sliding scale here with all of these options to say what are the specific, you know, sometimes
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.720]   there are opportunities to get out of it, right? Many times you can get out of it. Okay, look,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.760]   my child is Brazilian, but they go to the Brazilian consulate in the country of registry
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.440]   and they file the papers and okay, they're exempt from their military service and then they reach
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.160]   past that age. But that's, I think, another thing that you want to be careful of. In addition,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.840]   you want to be careful of entangling yourself in a foreign tax net. I think the biggest one here,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.720]   the biggest problem here is for people who want to file for US American citizenship by descent.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.200]   If I were an Italian citizen, if I had a consulting client of mine who said,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   "I'm an Italian citizen, lived all over the world, lived in the United States for many years,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.080]   but his wife and children were Italian, sorry, were dual nationals, Italian and US American,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.240]   he was thinking about whether he should get a US American citizenship. Well, my answer to him was
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.480]   don't. There was no benefit to him of becoming a US American citizen and yet, because of the
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.040]   financial and the tax implications, there were significant downsides to his being a US American
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   citizen. And so, I think there, the United States is one of the worst in the world because of the
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.840]   laws that it puts you under, but there are other countries as well. It's not just taxes though. So,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.520]   for example, in the United States, big reasons not to become a US American citizen, the United States
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.400]   imposes a lot of disclosure requirements. They say that you have to report all of your foreign
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.240]   bank accounts. And so, there are many countries that, especially in the wake of the United States
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   aggressiveness on this front, in the wake of the FATCA legislation, many countries around the world
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   have come together to create the Common Reporting Standards, CRS, on bank accounts and information
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.600]   sharing held abroad. Many countries do not yet impose the requirements of a country like the
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.680]   United States, where they say, all right, if you have an account that's outside of our border and
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.440]   if it's worth more than 10, if you have more than $10,000 in aggregate and accounts that,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.800]   count value and accounts that you control, you have to report them all to us, then you
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.640]   have to tell us about them. But countries are moving in that direction. And so, you might want
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.880]   to be wary about getting involved with a country that has such significant disclosure requirements.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.040]   This, I think, is especially going to be a factor as the cryptocurrency wars become more strong.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.400]   Let's say that you're a citizen of a country that bans cryptocurrency for its citizens and residents.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.000]   That's happening right now. There are major countries right now that are talking about
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.200]   banning cryptocurrency holdings. You see right now the United States this year on your tax returns
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.160]   requires you to disclose if you hold cryptocurrencies. So, that is a factor that you want to
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:18.880]   weigh carefully. There may be other laws and regulations that are difficult for you. For
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:26.640]   example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been a major thorn in the side of many businessmen
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.240]   seeking to go abroad. The basic US-American perspective on the Foreign Corrupt Practices
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.000]   Act is that bribing people is illegal and you shouldn't engage in it. And so, when you call
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.400]   something like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and you say, "Is this a bad thing or a good thing?"
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.840]   then most people say, "Of course, it's a good thing. We don't want people going abroad and
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.960]   committing foreign corruption." The challenge is that that's a very myopic worldview. Much of the
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:01.680]   world functions very broadly on gift culture and on social networks as being the primary thing. And
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.960]   so, the things that from a US-American perspective are seen as corruption are not always seen as
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.120]   corruption in other places. And so, if you sign up to become a citizen of a country that has some
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.280]   kind of legislation like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that can make your business
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   doings very difficult, where you're not able to participate in the local culture the way that
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.600]   things are done. So, that would be an example. You would also want to be very careful about
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.080]   allying yourself with a country that is, I guess, not particularly popular at the moment.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.920]   So, in today's world, a good example would be a country like Iran. If you qualify for citizenship
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.520]   by descent in Iran, you could file for it, but it's going to make your life much more complicated.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.640]   If you're living in the United States, you're a US-American citizen by birth
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.960]   or by naturalization, and you can just simply say, "Yeah, I'm not Iranian," your life internationally
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.240]   is going to be much, much simpler, not having to deal with the sanctions that many countries
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.360]   around the world have placed upon people of your nationality. There have been many other examples.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.920]   You could think back to the 1980s for South African citizens with the international unpopularity of
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.480]   South Africans at that time. So, those would be some examples that come to mind. And I think,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.000]   finally, with regard to residencies, residencies are a little bit more practical. You don't have
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.840]   nearly as many requirements placed upon you if you're a resident of a country. So, maybe you love
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.480]   living in Brazil, but you don't want your children to be subjected to mandatory military service.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.720]   Well, you might just get a residency permit, and because you're not a citizen, you don't have to
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.400]   bother with it. This is the same thing that I advised my client who was Italian living in the
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.600]   United States. He had a green card in the United States, permanent residency permit. There was no
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.840]   benefit to his becoming a citizen, other than I guess he could vote, but there was no benefit to
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.040]   his becoming a US citizen, but there were many drawbacks. But as a resident of the United States,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.200]   yes, he's still subjected to the same laws, subjected to the same taxes, subjected to the
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:15.520]   same disclosure requirements, but if he wanted to leave, his process and his ability to leave the
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.400]   system and just simply surrender his residency permit would be much simpler than if he was a
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.000]   citizen. And so, the residency permit can be a good way to allow you to live somewhere without
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   being subject to all of the laws. The downsides of a residency permit are far fewer. They're more
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.760]   practical. Usually, there's the cost of getting it and then the hassle of maintaining it. So,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.120]   many residency permits require you to spend a certain amount of time in that country, Canada.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.200]   If you have a Canadian permanent residency permit, you have to be there for two out of every five
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.680]   years to keep it active. The United States, if you have a US-American permanent residency permit,
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.760]   a green card, you have to be there the majority of your time to keep it active, otherwise they
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   can revoke it. You know, many places throughout the world, right, you can get a Panama residency
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.840]   permit, but you're supposed to go back, I think it's once every two years, to maintain that
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   residency permit. And so, you may not want to go to Panama every couple of years. This is why I
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.480]   think Mexico is such a good option and why it's one of my first recommendations for US-Americans,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.920]   because once you get a Mexican permanent residency permit, under current law, which could change at
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.520]   any time, under current law, there is no requirement, there's no physical presence
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.720]   requirement to maintain that permit. So, you can get a Mexican permanent residency permit,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.560]   and notice I'm saying permanent resident, when you become a permanent resident in Mexico,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.640]   you can maintain that in theory for life without physically being president in Mexico at any time.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.320]   And so, that's one of the reasons why it's so powerful. The final thing would be cost, right,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.720]   the practicalities of the cost. There are costs associated with every single one of these options.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.000]   There's simple costs of plane tickets. You can have low-cost options, right? Mexico is a very
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.720]   low-cost option if you have savings, but you still have to go there, you still have to pay the
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.240]   attorney fees and deal with that. There's still the hassle factor. Some residency programs are
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.880]   much more expensive. You want to become a permanent resident of Singapore, you're going to
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.560]   be shelling out millions of dollars and sometimes buying things that you wouldn't otherwise buy.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.600]   And so, it's got to be important enough to you to actually be willing to do that.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.960]   So, on the whole, I think that the advantages far outweigh the costs,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:35.760]   and if you're thoughtful and careful about the particular nations that you work with,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.840]   then I think you can diminish those. I guess the last thing I didn't say with regard to
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:46.640]   citizenship is that sometimes the cost of becoming a citizen of a country that you're entitled to
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.840]   is that you have to relinquish your other citizenships. There aren't as many of these
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:14:00.240]   countries who require, who forbid their citizens of being dual citizens as there once was,
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.320]   but there are still some very prestigious countries that do not permit dual citizenship.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:14.640]   So, you know, in the European Union you have countries like, let's see, Austria,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.440]   I think you have a country like the Netherlands, I think is quite strict about it. Germany will
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.840]   allow dual citizenship, but only with approval from the German government, only with certain
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.480]   countries. So, you could be a US-American, US-German dual national, but it would be very
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:37.760]   hard for you if you're from Ukraine to become a Ukrainian-German dual national. They're going to
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:44.880]   want you to relinquish your first citizenship. I think that places like Singapore, right,
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.440]   Singapore would be probably the most prestigious right now, the most attractive citizenship that
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.200]   somebody would love to file for, but Singapore does not want you to have dual citizenship.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:04.480]   There are certainly, I'm sure, people who do it and just work hard to make sure the government
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.600]   doesn't know about it, but that would be the biggest downside. I guess probably the biggest
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.680]   country right now would be India, that simply India does not permit dual citizenship. They do
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:21.760]   have a scheme called the Overseas Indian Citizens. Basically, it's kind of like a second-class
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.800]   citizenship. And so, for people with Indian heritage, they can file for the Overseas,
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.360]   I forget the name of it, but the Overseas Indian Citizen Program, and they're given a quasi-Indian
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.600]   passport that's basically a permanent residence permit that allows them to live in India,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.160]   but it's not a full-fledged residence. They can't get a passport that they can travel on, etc.,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.840]   because if we're in order for them to, because India officially forbids dual citizenship.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.800]   So, in summary, it's worth doing. I think it's one of the simplest things you can do.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:59.520]   And citizenship by descent is slow, usually, but it's worth doing if you can, because it opens up
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.040]   tremendous options for you. But you just do want to be thoughtful and make sure that you're not
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.400]   unintentionally entangling yourself with a foreign government that is going to impose
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.200]   some onerous restrictions on you. >> Yeah, no, I appreciate it. That's a lot of good stuff to go
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.040]   through and to have enumerated, because that's exactly what I want to do, not to
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.480]   stumble into something accidentally just from ignorance. And those top things, I'd run into
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:37.920]   the security clearance potential question somewhat recently, but the military for children and other
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.960]   tax entanglements is a good thing to kind of have on my bullet list to check for these particular
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.480]   countries. So, I appreciate that. Thank you. >> I would simply reiterate that I think here
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.000]   today it matters what direction the country is going, right? So, let's talk where we are today,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.160]   right? Today is April 30, 2021. I think you could look at it and say, "What is the trajectory that
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.000]   this country is on, and do I want to be exposed to them?" The big topic right now is wealth taxes.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.480]   And there are many countries around the world that are actively lobbying for and passing wealth taxes,
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.960]   and they're passing them on a citizenship basis. And so, now South America, right? Right now you
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.920]   have Bolivia, Argentina is talking about a wealth tax, or maybe they passed – no,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.560]   they passed a wealth tax, I'm pretty sure. So, do I want to claim my – let's say that I'm a
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.480]   Canadian living in Canada and subject to the laws of Canada. Do I really want to claim my
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.640]   Argentinian citizenship and be subject to the wealth tax that they are rolling out?
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   I'm not so sure, right? If I'm not wealthy, then certainly I do, right? If I'm just a
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.000]   young college student, yeah, I'll claim it. If I've got $50 million in the bank, then no,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.440]   I don't want to be associated with that. In that situation, I would not claim an Argentinian
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.400]   citizenship. I would simply go and get another citizenship in another jurisdiction that doesn't
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:12.000]   have that same covetous nature that the Argentinian government has. And so, I think this is the
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.640]   challenge, especially in today's world, is that countries – I'm trying to be very practical and
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.880]   not be, you know, ideological here, but you want to just be thoughtful about the direction that the
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:31.360]   country is on. So, this was why I, you know, strongly discouraged the Italian guy from
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.280]   becoming an American. Why? Because the direction of the United States is the wrong direction.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.200]   And so, becoming a citizen of the United States for somebody who is poor
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.400]   makes all the sense in the world, right? To gain access to the US labor markets, to gain access to
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.080]   a more high-quality travel document, etc. But if you're wealthy, then the United States doesn't
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.920]   offer anything, and yet the direction is the wrong way. So, we're going in the direction of
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.000]   wealth taxes and increased capital gains taxes, and it just goes on down the road. And so,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.920]   you want to be thoughtful and you want to choose places where freedom is increasing,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.840]   where taxation is modest, and where they have an appropriate, you know, mindset around it.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:17.920]   I would take a Singapore citizenship all day long. Why? Because they understand that wealth and money
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.240]   flows where it's treated well. And so, they have a very fair tax regime. They have a territorial
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.280]   tax system, which I think is the most just and fair tax – income tax system that can exist.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.680]   If you're going to have income taxes, it should be a territorial tax system. And even that tax
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.720]   system itself is low, and there's a culture of respect for wealth and for business people.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.360]   And so, I think you just want to be very thoughtful and don't ally yourself with
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.440]   governments where the culture is going in the wrong direction, because you can't change that
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.480]   cultural force, that cultural direction overnight. Long-winded answer. John, go with – what was
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.600]   your second question? Let's do it fast. Yeah, okay. Yeah, good. No, it's good. And you can't
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.000]   change those forces yourself either. So, that's good to know. The other question was just something
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   that was on my list for a long time, but you can skip over it. I'd read a book called "Why the West
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.920]   Rules" for now, and I'd seen – I'd read it a while back, and I saw it somewhere on one of your
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.560]   social medias at some point that you were reading it or had started reading it. I was curious
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.440]   what you thought about it in general, but that's probably too open-ended of a question for a quick
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.960]   one. That would be a fun question for us to talk about, but you're right. We're not going to handle
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.680]   it. We're not going to do it today. It's too much to handle. No, I appreciate it. Yeah, thanks for
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   going through the other questions. Thank you very much. My pleasure. It is a topic that I've been
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.320]   thinking a lot about. You know, where's the trend in the world? What direction is the trend going?
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.760]   And one of the most fascinating things about any book is the way that that book starts. The book
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.120]   that he's talking about is called "Why the West Rules" for now, and it starts with just a fabulous
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.440]   mind experiment, a historical experiment. I won't ruin it for you, but if you're interested in
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:07.680]   topics of where's the world going, then I would recommend it to you. All right, we go to New York.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.120]   Kate, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? Hi, Joshua. Thank you for choosing me. I
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:20.800]   canceled Netflix. Now I purchased your channel. Great. Okay, so today I have a question.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.920]   Yes. So today I have a question regarding the wise use of a large amount of cash,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:33.360]   either towards early retirement or towards putting down as a down payment for a house.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:41.280]   My homework I did is I listened to all of your podcasts on a keywords house and also keywords
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.400]   portfolio allocation. So I didn't find the answer. So my situation is right now I have
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:22:00.480]   in total 400,000 assets in different portfolios. 30% is in retirement stock, 20% is in emergency
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.960]   fund, and 50% this one is a little bit high is in investment silver metal. It's accidental,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.280]   but when I bought the silver, it was really low. So I was actually already making about 80,000 now
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:19.760]   from the silver. I have a belief that the price will go up, but I don't know about that for sure.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:28.160]   So I look at my silver metal investment. There are 200,000 there, whether I should take them out
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:35.920]   and then put it as a down payment for a house. I would need that as a minimum in this region
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:43.120]   to buy a house for myself or just take it out and put it in stock market and then grow it
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.360]   towards early retirement. Do you want to retire early?
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.680]   Yes. Yes. I have a strong interest in doing that.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.240]   And do you want to retire based upon having a stock portfolio, spending three or 4% of
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.480]   your stock portfolio value every year? Is that your plan?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:09.600]   Yes. That's part of my plan and also being able to pursue things that I'm ultimately interested in.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.840]   Okay.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.200]   Do things that I love to do.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.960]   How much money do you need to be financially independent and retire?
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:28.000]   If I live in my current apartment, I probably need $4,000 to $5,000 a month.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.800]   $4,000 to $5,000 per month if you live in your apartment. Would you keep living in your apartment
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.680]   if you were retired?
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:42.720]   I wouldn't say this is the ideal situation. I wouldn't if I have the choice.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.560]   Okay. Is your ideal situation, would there be any cost savings? Would you be able to live
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.760]   less expensively in your ideal situation?
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.800]   Yes. I would like to. And I would actually like to purchase a place across the river because I
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.760]   live in New York City. I would like to find a cheaper place in New Jersey because I like the
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   community better there.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:12.560]   If you were financially independent, let's just say $60,000 a year, so you had $1.5 million in
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.160]   the bank, 4% rule, $60,000 per year. If you were financially independent, you had $1.5 million
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.480]   in the bank, would you live in that apartment in New Jersey?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.760]   That question needs a little bit of research because I just started to research the community
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:32.240]   in New Jersey. I find a really lovely city. I can see myself living there long-term, but I'm not
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.200]   sure whether forever I should live there.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:44.320]   Okay. So here is my comment. Number one, I believe that before you make financial decisions,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.120]   meaning before you decide, "Should I sell my house or should I buy a house?"
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.880]   Meaning before you decide, "Should I sell this silver and buy stock? Should I buy a house?
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.600]   Should I not?" I believe you should solve three things to the very best of your abilities.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.040]   Not perfect, right? This is just to get you thinking in the right direction. These are the
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.720]   three questions that will drive the structure of your life.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.160]   Question number one is, "Who do you live with?" Who do you live with? Who is in your house?
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.200]   Who is in your neighborhood? Who do you live with? Because the person and the people that you
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:21.440]   live with is going to make a bigger difference in your life than virtually any other factor.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:28.560]   This involves husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends. This involves parents, right?
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.000]   I stretch it out. This involves children. This involves all the way out to grandparents,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.040]   neighbors, etc. But the first thing I would look at is I would say, "Who do I want to live with?"
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.640]   and make sure that I've established my ideal lifestyle first. If somebody is not married and
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.360]   wants to marry, I encourage them to make that a top priority and to invest their time and their
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   treasure into making that happen quickly. If somebody is married and wants to have children,
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.960]   I encourage them to have children. Don't wait until you're financially independent or do some
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.360]   other thing. Just have children if that's what you want. You won't regret it. Have the children.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.000]   If you want to have mom and dad live with you, then move mom and dad in with you. If you want
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.160]   to move away from mom and dad, then move away from mom and dad. Because getting the people in
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.200]   your life right will make a big difference. I extend this even to local culture. There are
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.280]   some people for whom living in a small town because the kind of people who live in a small
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:25.120]   town make them happy. Other people, big city, right? Or what's the culture that you live in?
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.440]   But the people in your life are going to make a bigger difference in your enjoyment and your
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.640]   experience of life than virtually anything else. And so you should try to make sure that your life
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.120]   is filled with the people that you want to have in it and that the people that you don't want in
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.520]   your life are not present. Number two question is where do you live? And I apply that on a macro
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.360]   scale but also down to a micro scale. Where do you live in terms of what country do you live in?
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   What state do you live in? What city do you live in? What neighborhood do you live in? What house
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:01.840]   do you live in? And so if you would in retirement live across the river, then I would encourage you
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.040]   to ask yourself, "Can I live across the river now?" The answer might be no because it's obvious that
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.000]   right now you need to go to work and across the river doesn't allow that to happen. But try to
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.880]   live where you want to live now and try to put your money there now. So if it takes you, if you
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.840]   don't like where you live now but there's a place that you could move and you could spend $200,000
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.800]   getting into that place that you would want to live, I would do that before I would start saving
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.720]   for early retirement because I want to live in the place that I want to live because that's
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.200]   going to be the structure of your life. Number three question is what do you do for work?
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.080]   What do you do? And I'm convinced that you should, before you spend time building an early
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.360]   retirement plan, you should spend a lot of time thinking and working hard to build the very best
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:52.160]   plan for a life that you won't want to retire from. And I think this is given very short shrift.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.960]   It's given too little attention by many people because retirement seems like the obvious solution,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.360]   right? It's like, "Hey, I got a job. I'm making X amount. I can live on Y amount. Thus, I can
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:09.600]   save this amount and in 14.2 years or in 7.3 years, I'll be financially independent." Great.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.320]   I'm not opposed to that. I think that's fine. But why don't we start by doing a whole lot of work
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.560]   to say, "Is there a career or is there a job or is there a business that could fit me really well?"
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.120]   In the year 2021 in which we live, we're no longer in the world where there's only three
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.400]   job offers available to you. And almost anybody can design a life that they won't ever want to
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:37.440]   retire from. And I've simply read too many early retirement stories from people that prove to me
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.120]   that very few people want to actually just quit their work. And so you can do almost anything.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.600]   And I think that it's better to invest money into building a life that you don't want to retire from
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:54.640]   before you start making a plan for retirement. And so sometimes that just means, "Hey, I'm working a
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.840]   job. I like this job. It's fine. It fits me great." But sometimes it means I should go back to school.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.840]   I should move across the world and I should get a new degree or get a new certification and get
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:10.480]   a new job at a new place. But spend time thinking about it and first invest your money into that
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:17.120]   before you think about a portfolio. Now, to the degree that you can spend money on any of those
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.720]   three things, I'm convinced you should before you start buying stocks, buying real estate,
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.520]   buying silver coins. I'm convinced you should spend money on those three things because those
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.600]   three things drive the structure of your life far more than any other financial choice or any other
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.240]   financial investment. And if you live with the people that you want to live with, the people
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.880]   of your dreams, the people that make you happy just to be around, and you live in a place that
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.760]   you love, a city that you love, a country that you love, an apartment that you love, a house that you
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   love, and you do something that you feel genuine satisfaction from that makes you money, then it's
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.600]   really hard to get yourself in the position where you actually want to quit that life. That feels
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.800]   really, really good. And now I'm convinced that in that structure, your financial results can,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.120]   in the vast majority of jobs and businesses and whatnot, can really flourish because you bring an
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.920]   energy and a joy to your life because you're living a life that you've intentionally chosen.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.880]   Now, not all choices will financially flourish. You might say, "I want to be a park ranger because
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.000]   I really love being out in nature, and so I want to get a job working for the National Park Service."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.600]   That is not going to financially flourish, but it's still going to be fine. It's going to give
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   you enough money to live on. You can live in park housing. You can still save money if you're frugal.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.600]   You can have access to a retirement program. So it's still fine. But I would say that's the
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.720]   minor 20%. The guy who's a missionary or the guy who is a mail carrier or something like that,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.400]   those jobs are not going to financially flourish the way that most things can. But most jobs,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:01.760]   when you come at them from a place of choice and from a place of thoughtful creation, you can make
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.160]   a lot of money and reach your early retirement goals faster. So you can still do the financial
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.880]   independence plan, but it should come after those three things. So if anything in your life in those
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.040]   three areas is not how you would dream it to be, and if you can spend money to make it better,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.960]   then I think that's what you should do. So this is my answer to your house question.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.840]   Should you buy the house and use the money for a house, or should you buy stocks? Well,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.360]   my answer is it depends on whether the house of your dreams that you would love to live in
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:38.240]   would be there, if you could buy that with a $200,000 down payment or not. And I'm not saying
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.320]   you should spend money excessively. You'll have to decide how frugal you should be.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:49.840]   But if I could spend $200,000 to buy a house that I would love being in, that would be perfect for
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:56.400]   me and my family, I would do that before I would go and buy stocks. Now, if you're fine where you
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.760]   are and you're living where you would dream to live, then yeah, stocks would be fine.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.480]   But I would answer it in the context of the personal side of personal finance.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.920]   It's not a financial question. It's a matter of a lifestyle. You've obviously worked hard.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:16.560]   You've saved money. So I believe that you should adjust your lifestyle to your ideal lifestyle
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.720]   and then go ahead and live that life versus deferring all of those things
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.080]   forever just to reach some vague early retirement goal.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:33.440]   Yes, very illuminating. Make me happy just by listening to you. I would definitely be working
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:39.040]   on designing a life of happiness and fulfillment instead of thinking more of the materialistic
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   side of life. Good. Good. I think that you could see a common thread that the people who are the
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:51.120]   best suited for early retirement are the people who haven't sacrificed something that was important
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:58.080]   to them along the way. Let me give you an example. If I weren't married and didn't have children,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:03.360]   I would not live in a house. I would live in a van or an RV or something like that. But it's not
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.840]   because it would save me money. It's because I think it's genuinely fun and it's a lifestyle
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.280]   that I genuinely enjoy. Or at least I think I've done it for part time, but I think I would
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.520]   genuinely enjoy it. As best as I can tell, if I were 30 years old and not married, no children,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:27.360]   I would live in an RV. But I wouldn't see myself as suffering. I would use as an advantage of it,
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.600]   I would use an advantage of I'm spending just a little bit of money and I'm saving money and I'm
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.920]   becoming financially independent very quickly and I'm building my pathway towards early retirement,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.480]   but I'm not suffering for it. It's just simply that's how I'd want to live and that's how I
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.360]   would live before retirement and that's how I'd live after retirement. It'd just be that would
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.960]   be fun for me in most circumstances, I think. And so these are the kinds of decisions that for the
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.080]   people for whom early retirement is right, they're the people who make those decisions comfortably.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.160]   They choose to live in a small house because they like the ethic of living in a small house or they
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.040]   like the lifestyle of being a minimalist and not having a lot of stuff and they just enjoy that.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.760]   It gives them a sense of peace and it has the benefit of allowing them to also become financially
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:19.280]   independent fairly quickly. The people who suffer though are those who set this goal to say,
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.520]   "I want to be financially independent. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to move out of our
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.560]   big house that we really love that's appropriate for our family and we're going to move in a little
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:34.240]   tiny house. And I don't like my job, but I make a lot of money and if I just do this for 8.1 more
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.440]   years, then we'll be financially independent." And they go down the list, right? "Well, we want
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.600]   to have children, but not yet because we're just going to... If we just go a little bit longer,
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.320]   we'll have $2 million and then we can have our children and travel around the world."
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.840]   And listen, we all make our choices and we all live with the consequences of those choices.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.520]   But I don't think it makes sense to approach things that way. I think you first start by
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.000]   building your life intentionally. And if you don't want to have children, great, don't have children.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.520]   If you want to have children, have children. If you want to live in a little house or in a big
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.720]   house, go ahead. Be aware of the opportunity cost of those decisions. Know them, right? I'm not
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.920]   running from them, but don't build your life around this deferred gratification that someday
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.720]   in the future when I have $2 million saved, then I'm going to go ahead and start living.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:29.920]   Because I think you look back and you say, "Well, the last 10 years, right? I could have had both.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   I could have done both things." And I say, "Why not do both? Why not live the life now that you
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.640]   want to live while also knowing that in the fullness of time, you can achieve financial
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.320]   independence, which will put you in a different stage of life." I don't see any reason why it
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   has to be one or the other. - Got it. I think the biggest learning is that if you answer
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.360]   the calling of your life in terms of happiness and fulfillment, then those financial questions
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:01.200]   will be answered naturally. So I don't need to struggle over because there's no definitive
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.280]   answer. It depends on how you want to design your life. - Right. And so here would be one exercise
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.360]   that I'll give you as you're thinking about this. And I frequently do this when I consult with
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:20.720]   people. How old are you right now, Kate? - I'm 42. - You're 42. Okay. So at 42 years old, you have
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:27.520]   $400,000 saved. So let's put this in and start with $400,000. And let's say that you invest
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:35.840]   from 42 to 67, would be 25 years, right? 25 years. Let's say you invest all your money in your whole
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:42.080]   savings into stocks and maybe you make 7% on your money and you don't save another dime for
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:52.080]   retirement. Okay. At the age of 67, you would be predicted to have $2,170,000 in your portfolio,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:59.600]   given those constraints that I said. Does that make sense? - Yes. - Okay. At 67, would $2,170,000
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:06.160]   be enough for you to live on for the rest of your life? - I think so, unless I decide to live until
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:12.160]   120. - I think even if you live till 120, you'd be fine. And I think you should live to 120 and
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.000]   you'll be fine. Okay. So when people have saved a lot, one of the tools that I use to try to get
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.560]   past this mental block is I say this. Let's say that you release yourself from the responsibility
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:33.120]   of saving money and you say, "I'm fine. I have enough money saved that if I just put all of this
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:39.360]   aside and I leave it alone for the next 20 or 30 years, I'm going to be fine for the rest of my
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.120]   life. I've covered my old age when I don't want to work and when I can't work." And so let's say
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.800]   that we now redesign your life and I give you two rules. Number one, you need to choose for
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:57.440]   yourself a life that you genuinely want to live and you need to support that life from your daily
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:04.480]   actions. That's rule number one. Rule number two is you cannot save any money. You are forbidden
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:11.440]   from saving any money. You have to spend all of the money that you make. Now, if I give you those
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:19.440]   rules, could you build for yourself a really cool and exciting life that wouldn't have you deferring
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:27.200]   forever the fun things that you want to do? - Yes. Could you explain the purpose of rule number two?
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:34.000]   - The rule number two is this. The rule number two is this. You have said no for many years to
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.560]   specific consumption items that you would have enjoyed doing because you were pursuing this
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.960]   personal goal of building wealth. And I think that's fine. By the way, this is a mental experiment.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:52.720]   You can do this if you want to. I'm trying to use this as a mental experiment, right? So, what I'm
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   trying to get at is to say that you have denied yourself consumption, financial consumption,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.600]   that you've otherwise thought would be fun because of your focus on building wealth. I applaud you
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.840]   for that. I think that's well done. But because of that, you're used to thinking not from an
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.520]   abundance mindset but from a scarcity mindset. You're used to thinking, "You know what? I could
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:21.920]   fly to... My girlfriend invited me this weekend to go to Colorado with her and go skiing at Vail,
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.320]   but that's going to cost a lot of money. And after all, I could just see her here in the city.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.160]   Why do that?" Right? Or I could... So and so, my parents wanted me to come and visit for
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.800]   a family holiday, but I don't really want to spend the money to go see them. And so, I'm just going
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.640]   to not do that. And you know what? It would be really nice to have a fancy new bag, but I don't
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.040]   need it. And after all, it's silly consumption. So, you said, "No, no, no," again and again and
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.160]   again to things. And so, what happens is it gets you stuck in this mindset of scarcity,
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.320]   where you have your income and you have to save money and you have to spend just as little as you
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.400]   can. And you're not good at thinking about the things that you really want or the things that
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   you would really enjoy, the lifestyle you really want, because you've said, "No, no, no, no, no,"
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:12.320]   to everything along the way. So, here's my point. You're 42 years old. You may not make it to 50.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.200]   You may not make it to 60. You may not make it to any of those things. And so, what if you just
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.360]   played this game and you said, "I'm going to take all the $400,000. I'm going to set it aside. I
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:26.080]   have it for retirement. And now, I'm going to make money." How much money do you earn right now, Kate?
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.480]   I'm making $150,000 a year.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.080]   So, I'm going to make $150,000 per year. I'm going to pay my taxes. I'm going to pay my expenses.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:43.360]   And my goal is I... My rule is I have to spend all the money. I have to spend it. Now, I don't
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.600]   have to spend it all this week, but I have to spend it all this year. If I don't spend all the
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.920]   money this year, then it goes away. And you start funding the things that you would really like to
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.480]   do. Now, the people who are the happiest are the ones who fund all the things they would like to
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.040]   do and still have more left over. And my guess is you could do that, right? You could save $30,000,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.080]   $40,000, $50,000 a year every year for the rest of your life and still spend the rest of it.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.120]   So, let's play the game slightly different, okay? Let's say that the only money you were allowed to
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.640]   save, right? You have $400,000 in savings, and you're going to save for the next 25 years,
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.760]   you're going to make 7%. But all you can do is put money in a 401(k). Do you have a 401(k)?
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.520]   Yes, I do.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:29.360]   So, you can put... I'm just going to use a flat $20,000 per year into that account,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.720]   just a flat $20,000 per year. And I'm ignoring employer matches and anything like that,
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:42.160]   just $20,000 per year flowing in. Well, now in 25 years, that would be $3.4 million, okay?
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:51.520]   So, $3.4 million. And that would be more than enough at age 67. And so, if you dial down your
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:58.080]   savings, then I think you can dial up your lifestyle and you could choose something that
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.960]   you would really want to do. Now, let's say that you decided, "I would not take this job. If I were
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.120]   financially independent, if I had $2 million in the bank, I would not take this job. I definitely
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:13.520]   wouldn't." Well, what would you do? And maybe you would say, "I would really love to run a mountain
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.800]   bike shop in the mountains of Italy." We're just talking about Italy, right? "I would love to run
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.880]   a mountain bike shop in the mountains of Italy." Okay, well, maybe you do that. And then you don't
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.280]   make a ton of money, but you make enough money to live on, and you make enough money, and you have
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.880]   to spend it all because you know you're financially independent. And so, this way of thinking is my
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.720]   tool to say, "Why should you wait until you're 50 to live like you're financially independent,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.600]   when you can start living like you're financially independent at 42?"
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.040]   Right? At 42, you're rich. So, when are you going to start thinking like a rich woman?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.280]   -
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.520]   I never thought I'm rich.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.160]   -
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.560]   You are rich. You are rich. You're in the top... I don't have the chart here,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.840]   but I would say, what, the top 20 to 30% of US American households, in terms of your personal
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.080]   wealth. There is nothing that you could tell me. There's not a goal that you could put in front of
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.680]   me that with $400,000, I can't figure out a plan to achieve. There's nothing. Nothing.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.280]   -
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.640]   Yeah, I think I was always having a little bit aspirational anxiety because I didn't really
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:26.320]   prioritize my life based on what I absolutely love to do. So, this is really illuminating.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:26.720]   -
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:34.160]   Good. Good. Give some thought to this. Go back and listen to the recording and do that exercise I
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.400]   said. And again, this can all be done mentally. You don't need to change a thing with what you're
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:45.280]   doing externally. But what I would say is, try some of the exercise. Okay, if I were financially
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   independent today, what would I do? And here's how I approach that. Okay? Let's pretend that today,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.560]   you had to stop working. What would you do? Now, give it a year later. Just imagine yourself,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.240]   you spend a whole year reading, right? I love to read. If you said, Joshua, you can't work,
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.040]   what would you do? I would go and I'd spend 30 hours a week reading. But I'm not going to do
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.280]   that 30... I mean, at some point, you got to do something with what you're learning. The whole
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:17.680]   point of learning something is so that you can use it. It's like, I love to sit... I love to read a
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:24.720]   novel on a vacation. Give me a big, thick novel for a vacation. I'll finish it in three days.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.880]   And then I'm ready to be done with novels. I don't want to read any more novels once I've
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.960]   read one for vacation. And so, give yourself a year in your head to de-stress. Write down
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.920]   everything you would do. I would go to a such and such retreat on the shores of Mexico or wherever
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.440]   you would go. Now, what would you do when you came back a year later? Would you write? Would you go
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:51.200]   to a coffee shop? Would you take a job? Would you arrange flowers? Would you restore classic cars?
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.800]   What would you do? So, imagine the kinds of things that you would do. And then ask yourself,
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.680]   what if I gave myself this rule? Instead of working another eight years at this job,
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   this $150,000 a year job I don't like, what if I just went and I worked at this other job that
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:12.160]   would allow me to live this lifestyle I want to live? And maybe I make $70,000 per year, but my
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.920]   rule is I can spend the whole 70. I don't have to put in my 50% savings rate. I can just spend the
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.080]   whole 70. What would that allow me to do? And I think that this is a really good way to live.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.320]   And it gets at, I think it's a good responsible mental game that gets to the heart of some of
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.080]   the options that really are available to you. - Wow, I didn't even know I've already had this
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:41.040]   kind of freedom in my life. Because when you're climbing certain corporate ladder,
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.520]   you didn't realize because you always look up and realize, oh, maybe you are not climbing high
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:51.200]   enough. And then you forgot to look down and realize, oh, you actually have already have a
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:57.840]   free playground. You can play a little now. - Right, yeah, you do. And finding the balance
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.640]   that's right for you, I think just takes a little bit of time and practice. But for me,
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:09.120]   this is some of the change I've gone through, is I used to say, well, it's all about saving for the
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.160]   future. But I've learned to give myself more permission to just, it sounds so corny, to live
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:23.600]   in the present. And to say, there's no rule that I have to save a huge amount of my income. It's
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:29.920]   okay to spend it. And I've seen enough examples of people that I admire that live that way to say,
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.960]   they live better. And at the end of the day, it's not the amount of money that you die with.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:41.360]   The end of the day, it's much more about the life that you live. And so many of us have plenty of
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.840]   money to fund the life that we want to live, but we're stuck in that traditional model.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.200]   And in the same way that the classic retirement concept of work, work, work for 40 years so you
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.960]   can retire and live out your 30 good years, that can be a form of bondage. So also can the early
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:03.360]   retirement model be a form of bondage? It's just a different form. And so I think that any life plan
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.160]   can be fine for the person who chooses it thoughtfully. But once you've accumulated some
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:16.160]   basic capital, as you have, I don't think there's any reason to wait to think about more of how
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.800]   you're going to live. All right, we move on now. Thank you, Kate, for being here. And I'd love to
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.880]   keep, call in in a month and let's chat about it again and see. I have got to go fast. Let's go
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.360]   to Eric. Eric, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:34.400]   Hey, Joshua, how's it going? First of all, I'll try and make it quick. I appreciate your
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.560]   podcast that you posted on Wednesday about when things aren't working out. I think that's always
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.640]   great when somebody who seems to have everything figured out can kind of come back down. Because
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.400]   that's what it sounds like when you're talking, you're hearing you talk a lot of times like,
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.600]   man, he just has everything figured out. This is crazy. So it is always great to hear that. So I
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.480]   appreciate that. Thank you. My actual question comes back to crypto. I feel like I was calling
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.760]   with crypto questions. And real quick, I think I have the idea of what's going to happen. I do a
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:10.720]   lot of work for cryptocurrency. I mine, I get paid in it. And I assume with all my taxes, like the
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:16.640]   way that it works is that I pay all my taxes on income on the crypto when I got it and the value
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.440]   that it was at as like my normal income tax for, you know, just as if I were paid in cash. And then
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.880]   obviously things have spiked in the past couple of years. And in which case now I assume that if I
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.080]   were to liquidate any of that or, you know, if I were to convert any of that into cash, then I'm
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.920]   also going to have to pay capital gains on on the increase in price of that. Does that sound about
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.040]   right to you? It does. Okay, cool. That that was, you know, after talking to a couple tax people and
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:50.160]   reading IRS guidance and all that stuff, that was that is pretty much where I landed at. And so I'm
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   just I'm basically where I'm at right now is I don't need any of my crypto investments in order
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.440]   to live my normal life. But watching that number tick up and up and up and up, I just wonder,
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:09.840]   you know, given the United States current current, you know, seeing how how potentially crypto is
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.920]   going to be treated in the future. You know, I just wonder, like, gosh, is this something that
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   I should just leave locked up for a long time and just see, hey, in the next decade or so,
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.680]   you know, what is the landscape going to look like versus, you know, cutting and running now
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:28.080]   that the price is so high? My personal belief is that it's going to go a lot higher in the next
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.480]   decade. But but again, just kind of want to hear your thoughts on that. Sounded accurate to you.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:40.080]   It does sound accurate to me. I would seriously consider if if it's possible for you,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:47.840]   since you are in such a high potential marketplace, I would consider all of the
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.360]   different ways that you could legally change your circumstances in order to change your tax regime,
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:00.320]   going moving to Puerto Rico, moving abroad, all of those options, you should consider them.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.680]   If we assume that you're not going to pursue any of those because they are lifestyles that you
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:12.800]   don't want to live, then I think that you you yeah, you just press forward. You do as you decide,
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:19.360]   if you as you've said, in terms of paying declaring taxes on the amount of payment that you receive
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.280]   at the time that you receive it. That's the basic IRS doctrine. And that's I don't expect
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.800]   them to change that at all. Right. Doesn't matter whether you get paid with Bitcoin,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.880]   whether you get paid with US dollars, whether you get paid with Swiss francs or whether you get paid
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:37.280]   with, you know, dump truck loads of apples. It's all the same. Right. If you are picking apples
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:44.480]   for an apple orchard and you as a daily part of your pay, you receive four bushels of apples
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.760]   as a benefit of your job. That's not tax free just because it's bushels of apples.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:56.720]   The IRS wants you to declare the value of the bushel of apple and to and to pay it.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:02.320]   Now, the benefit I think that you get is with the bushel of apple analogy is the same that you get
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:09.360]   with potentially crypto. So if you are declaring the value of the four bushels of apples that you
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.800]   receive from the local farmer that you spent the day picking apples for, you can declare that value
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.040]   at the wholesale price. So you're not taxed on that on those four bushels as if they are being
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:26.480]   sold one apple at a time at Whole Foods for five dollars a piece, you're being taxed on that as
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.600]   the bushel price that the farmer sells them to the wholesaler for, which is certainly a lower price
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.560]   than you could then go down the road and sell them for, you know, out of the back of your truck in
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.920]   front of the Whole Foods at four dollars a piece. And so that's the analogy that I understand to be
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.440]   the same with cryptocurrency. It's the same as with apples. If you receive the apples at a wholesale
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.400]   value of two dollars per apple, you know, based upon the bushel price and you go and you sell
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.160]   those from the parking lot across the street from the Whole Foods for four dollars an apple,
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:03.680]   then when you receive those apples, you when you receive them, you pay, you declare taxes based
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.320]   upon four bushels at two dollars an apple, whatever that comes out to per bushel. When you then sell
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:14.160]   them and make a profit, you incur a second tax based upon your gains and that the only difference
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:20.240]   would be it'd be a capital gain instead of an increase in instead of a business gain. And so
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:26.880]   then now, should you sell or should you not based upon the tax regime? I consider the United States
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:32.480]   very unfriendly to wealth at this point in time, not the most unfriendly country in the world,
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.440]   but I consider it to be unsafe for wealthy people to rely on the United States for the long term.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.800]   We can see that with President Biden's speech this last week. He expressed interest in some
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.760]   that made proposals for something like six trillion dollars of new spending programs.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:55.440]   He has made verbal proposals for massive tax increases, absolutely huge. And so,
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:02.800]   at least if you are a person of wealth. And so the question is, what's the direction? Now,
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:10.000]   first of all, the taxes that are proposed are not nearly enough. The numbers don't work. Go back
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.440]   and listen to the shows that I did almost two years ago now, where I talked about the ticking
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.520]   bomb that no one wants to talk about or whatever it was, where I talked about the numbers. And then
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:25.920]   put two years of hindsight into the play and listen to what I talked about two years ago
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.880]   and ask yourself, has this gotten better in the last two years or worse?
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:39.920]   And the answer is, it's gotten far worse than even the most pessimistic prediction would have
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:47.360]   been two years ago. And so the numbers are even worse now. And I'll give an episode number here
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.040]   in just a moment. The numbers are even worse than what I said two years ago.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:01.280]   Standby. All right, found it. It's episode 628 and 629 of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.000]   published in March of 2019, called Federal Debt, the Ticking Bomb that No One is Willing to Diffuse.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:15.280]   So the problem is even worse than what it was then by a massive order of magnitude because of
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:21.680]   the coronavirus pandemic and all of the spending there, all of the declines in tax revenue there.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.640]   And then now there's a massive political change. Now, let's just play this from-- this isn't
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   exactly what you said, but it's a topic of interest, I know, to you and to all listeners.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:37.360]   What can happen from here? Well, let's say, first of all, the cultural wins are in the favor of the
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:44.720]   tax and spend crowd, not in the favor of the let's not tax and not spend crowd. There's not a lot of
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:50.080]   actual weight that the words of any fiscal conservative has at this point in time.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:59.520]   President Trump presided over one of the largest increases in federal debt of anybody. And most
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:05.360]   Republicans didn't open their mouths because of the heavy consequences of doing so. And so I don't
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.920]   think that people who were in the fiscal conservative camp have much credibility at this
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:16.240]   point in time to talk about much. And so Republicans somehow seem to do better when they're in the
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:22.880]   opposition rather than the leadership. And so maybe they can slow down spending a little bit.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.040]   That was the example with President Obama. President Obama wound up being an extraordinarily
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.720]   fiscally conservative president, not because he wanted to be, but because Republicans were in
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:39.120]   opposition. And once he lost his majority in Congress after the first two years, then he
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:44.320]   basically got nothing done. And that seems to be the way that politics in the United States goes
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:50.480]   at this point in time, as you have gridlock, you can have a change. President Obama had two years
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.880]   of a Democratic House and Democratic Senate, and then everything changed. President Trump had two
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.520]   years of a Democratic House and Democratic Senate, and then everything changed. And so President
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:06.560]   Obama got nothing done except his Affordable Care Act. President Trump got basically nothing done,
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.520]   I guess, except the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. That was about it. And so we'll see what President
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.760]   Biden does in the two years. And if history is any indication, there's a good chance that he'll lose
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.880]   maybe the Congress, but maybe the Senate, depending on what happens two years from now.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.600]   And then he'll be stymied in his efforts as well. So you have political gridlock,
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:32.400]   but the general theme is more spending, more spending. It just always goes up.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.280]   So what can happen? Well, I think let's just play it with three scenarios.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.800]   The first scenario would be all of the people who for the last 50 years have been ringing the bell
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:48.080]   and saying, "This is unsustainable or right." And there's some kind of massive crisis, massive
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:53.840]   financial crash of some kind. And somehow everyone's all of a sudden proved right,
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.920]   that you can't spend, you can't borrow $28 trillion, it's just going to continue on,
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.680]   and there's a massive crash. Okay, well, that would certainly be a crisis, and you should be
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:10.320]   prepared for that. But that's probably unlikely. On the flip side, let's say that the people who
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:16.720]   say there's no limit to the amount of money that you can spend are right. I'm currently reading,
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:25.120]   what's her name? The Deficit Myth by Stephanie Kelton. I have here my thing, The Deficit Myth.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:31.760]   And this is the best, it's funny, we basically all in the modern world, we basically accepted
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:36.560]   what's now called modern monetary theory. And so I've been trying to grab my hands around,
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.280]   is there any actual theory to this? And early results are not promising, saying there's any
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.520]   actual theory to this. Basically, as I understand where we are right now in 2021,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:51.360]   really nobody knows what's happening or why things are the way that they are. And there's not really
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:56.000]   anybody who can give a cogent explanation as to why everything hasn't collapsed. And so the
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   direction we're going is in the direction of, well, it doesn't matter, governments can just
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.160]   make up as much money as they want. Because after all, government has unlimited taxing ability,
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:14.320]   unlimited spending ability, etc. I think some kind of middle ground morass is most likely.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.840]   I don't think that in the long run, at least the US American people are going to go for a hardcore,
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.280]   "Okay, we can just spend as much money as we want." At some point in time,
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.920]   there's some limit. I do not believe that we're living in a fundamentally new world where there's
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.360]   simply no limit, as Ms. Kelton would say. I don't believe that's true. I don't believe that makes
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:37.760]   any sense. And so while I might be the voice crying in the wilderness, and I might be embarrassed for
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.720]   the next five years, I still personally retain my conviction that you cannot tax and spend and tax
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:51.040]   and spend and make up money and expect that to be a long-term, you know, best interest. I'm actively
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:59:00.160]   questioning myself if I'm right, but I still don't believe it. But I also don't think a massive just
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:06.320]   collapse is likely, because I think there's simply too much raw horsepower at the moment under the
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.240]   hood of a country, a powerful economy like the United States and like many countries in the
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:19.920]   world. What I think is likely is I think is more likely is the constraint. I think it's more likely
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:26.800]   that you have just this ongoing morass where everyone is upset. You don't have enough ability
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   to lower taxes to get, you know, a widespread economic engine going, but it's not so bad that
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:38.000]   people are leaving in droves. Although I see it, the thing's picking up, right? There are a lot of
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.400]   people moving out of California and a lot of people who are doing actually doing it that I
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:47.120]   wouldn't have expected to do it. And I think that even people who haven't done it yet are thinking
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:54.400]   about it. I watched this show. I watched this YouTube channel called Producer Michael, and it's
[00:59:54.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   this guy, I forget his last name, but this music and film producer named Michael so-and-so, British
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.560]   originally, lives in California. He's a big luxury goods consumer, and it's fun to look at his
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:14.080]   millions of dollars of watch collections and things like this. And even he was recently saying
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.240]   that he's looking at options of how he can move outside of California, looking at different
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.760]   options. And I thought, man, if this guy who is a Hollywood producer who lives, you know, the
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.520]   straight-up Hollywood lifestyle, if he's talking about how awful it is, then this must go farther
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.840]   than I thought. It must go farther than I thought. And I see tons of people moving to Puerto Rico.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.880]   There still aren't many people disentangling themselves from the United States, but there are
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.960]   a lot of people moving to Puerto Rico, and I got to imagine there are a lot of people making plans.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.640]   So, let me land this plane. What I'm saying for you is I wouldn't worry too much about the
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.680]   long-term taxes because they're unpredictable. I don't know, but I think the taxes are probably
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   going to go up. And so, what I would – and also, you live in a volatile world. I would just look at
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.480]   it and I would say, "All right, at every level, is there a point to level up? Is there a point at
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:09.680]   which I go ahead and cash out some amount of this and stabilize it? Because with this, I can always
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:15.840]   be free." My best analogy that I use is think about who wants to be a millionaire. In "Who
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.440]   Wants to Be a Millionaire," there were times in the game where it made all the sense in the world
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.280]   to play, and there were times in the game where it didn't make any sense in the world to play
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.640]   aggressively because you had those ratchet points. So, in your first few questions,
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:34.000]   there was no reason not to just guess randomly on a question because you wanted to get to the first
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.040]   level of money. And so, for someone who doesn't have a lot of money, there's no reason not to be
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:47.520]   hardcore aggressive. Balls to the wall, everything in crypto, risk it all. Why not? Because the risks,
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.520]   you know, if you do fall, you don't fall that hard because you're falling down to zero.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.280]   But there are certain points in your lifestyle where you reach certain ratchet points where it
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.320]   would be really tough if you actually went down below that. You know, once you become a millionaire,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.120]   you don't ever want to not be a millionaire again. And so, maybe you reach and you've got $2 million
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.760]   of crypto, but you know that your $2 million of crypto could turn into $200,000 overnight.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.840]   Well, I'd like, once I'm a millionaire, I'd like to be a millionaire for the rest of my life.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.400]   And so, think about, all right, if things win, what would that do for me versus if things lose,
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.960]   what would that do for me? And just be thoughtful about the big swings and what could happen over
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.000]   the long term. And then go to your portfolio and make the decisions from that perspective,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.560]   not the tax perspective. - Cool. That sounds great. And I mean,
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.360]   that's basically what I'm doing right now is just, and talking to you is a piece of that, like, okay,
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.720]   let's just get another person's opinion on the landscape, what could happen,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.760]   tax implications, and just pulling from many sources. So, I appreciate your thoughts on it.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.160]   I mean, take up so much time. - No, it's not you, it was me. I just
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   thought it was, it's an important question that people are asking and it's something I'm actively
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:00.880]   thinking about. Again, I don't like to be wrong. Of course, none of us do, but I don't like to be
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   wrong and especially don't like to be wrong publicly 'cause it hurts my pride. But when I'm
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:11.600]   wrong, I wanna know why, because if I can learn from it, then I don't waste the experience of
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:18.240]   being wrong or of failing. And so, whenever I get something wrong, then I just wanna know. And so,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:26.400]   my question is this, why is it that fiscal conservatives, and I identify myself as a
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.760]   fiscal conservative, why is it that fiscal conservatives have been screaming with terror
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:38.560]   for decades about every trillion dollars of increased debt and yet there has been no disaster?
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:46.240]   Why have they been wrong so far? Is it because they were completely wrong? And maybe Stephanie
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.720]   Kelton is right? Is it because they were just wrong until now or what is it? And I still don't
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.960]   have the answer, but that's why I just take a moment to talk about it, 'cause I think it's good
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.520]   to acknowledge why have we been wrong so far when talking about the disaster. And that's why I don't
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.720]   personally think there's gonna be an overnight disaster. I don't think the United States is
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.960]   Zimbabwe. I hope that the United States is not Venezuela. But having watched Venezuela and having
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:16.080]   seen how fast things can collapse in a 10-year period, I do get increasingly concerned by the
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:22.880]   day. And when you see the sea change with regard to your own taxation, depending on how many figures
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:33.360]   are in your crypto portfolio, if President Biden's proposals become law quickly, your tax bill just
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.720]   got a lot bigger. And when you have something as insane as the concept of taxing people on their
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.200]   capital gains, what did the US government do to deserve a piece of the pie? They didn't provide
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.160]   anything. They didn't do anything that would in any way cause them to deserve a piece of the pie
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.120]   of the growth of your crypto value. Then you see how insane it is. I just think that's a...
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.600]   You should consider it, count your numbers, think about your plans, and then make whatever
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.880]   decision's right for you. - Well, and one last thing on the crypto note too, of at least kind
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.760]   of my strategy going forward as well, is looking at how there's so much clamoring for proof of work
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:19.280]   and now how proof of stake looks like it's gonna be... Probably going forward is gonna be more of
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.720]   a popular option and then using what crypto assets I do have in a proof of stake model.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:31.280]   And then potentially, basically using that as something that's gonna generate revenue for me
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.960]   with the amount of crypto that I have. So that's one of the other models that I'm looking at going
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.600]   forward as well. - Go for it.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.040]   - But yeah. - Love it.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.920]   - Yeah. Anyways, I'll stop the crypto talk for now.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.280]   - Oh, good. Have a great day, Eric. Appreciate it. All right, let's go to
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:50.880]   John in Chicago. John, welcome. How can I serve you today, sir? John in Chicago, are you there?
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.880]   Going once. Jeremy in Ohio. Welcome, sir. How can I serve you today, Jeremy?
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   - Hi, Joshua. So for the past 12 years, I've been teaching at an American public school,
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   but recently accepted a job teaching abroad. And so once I leave the current job, I have to decide
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:15.280]   what to do with the money I have in Ohio's pension system for teachers known as STRS. And I was just
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:20.160]   hoping you could provide some guidance on how I should approach the decision and potentially offer
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.400]   your opinion on what I should do. - Is this a defined benefit pension
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.680]   or is this a defined contribution program where you have an account?
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.640]   - Benefit. - Okay. What options are they giving you
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.840]   when you leave that job? What are they proposing to you?
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   - Yeah. And I guess to provide some context, there's approximately my account withdrawal
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:48.320]   value is $140,000 in the pension system, which I could just rolled into a pre-tax retirement account.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.960]   My wife and I are in our mid thirties. We don't have kids.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.760]   Our net worth, not including money in the pension is around $900,000.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:10.080]   - If the rest of your money that you have is invested in stocks, in stocks and real estate,
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.600]   what is the rest of the money invested in? - The stocks bonds.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.040]   - And when you move abroad, will you be earning a good income for your labor?
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.640]   - Yes. -
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.160]   How stable do you think the Ohio pension system is?
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:33.040]   - It is 76% funded, which doesn't seem great to me, but I think is pretty close to the
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:38.960]   quote unquote gold standard in the space. I'm quite confident it will never be any
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:44.240]   better than it is today. It will only get worse, but it's hard to say.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   - Do they offer you, if you don't take the $140,000,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.320]   what's the benefit that they're offering in the future?
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   - Every year it sits there, it earns 3% interest each year. And then potentially, when I cash out.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.400]   - But don't they have an income benefit that, "Hey, John, if you're 65 years old,
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.560]   you can take this amount of money." Or sorry, Jeremy, "You can take this amount of money."
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.280]   - Oh, yes. -
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.960]   Okay. So what is that figure? -
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:25.600]   And that's, yeah, it's so, currently, if I were to not work another day,
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:35.440]   12 years, it's about, it's 20% on the average of my highest five years,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:42.960]   which annually, sorry, that's like very hard to do.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.760]   - That's okay. That's good enough. -
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.000]   Let's say 12. - Okay. So what I,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.720]   I can't tell you, of course, what to do, but I'll tell you how I would get to what to do.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:58.480]   So let's start with the non-math answers. Non-math answer number one is the catastrophist model.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:05.040]   The catastrophist model says, "The state of Ohio is dumb. The whole world is going to collapse.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   People are leaving Ohio. It's poorly managed. I'm just going to take my money and run."
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:16.080]   I don't think that's the case, but like that, some people, their reasons for leaving a place
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:23.040]   are pretty clear. And without question, pensions, government pensions, are number one, they're a
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:31.280]   political tool, and they are sometimes poorly run. And that varies on a state-by-state basis.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.120]   And so the first thing I would do is I would try to get a little bit of understanding of
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.800]   how well run is the Ohio pension system, and how likely is this thing to fall apart?
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:48.720]   My answer is the chance is not zero, but it's not too high, right? There's going to be some
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:55.600]   benefit there. So now I go to your overall portfolio. If you only had $140,000 in savings,
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:01.440]   then I would say, "This is a really big deal to get right." In your situation, though, you and
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.840]   your wife have been financially productive enough to save quite a lot of money in other sources.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:12.240]   And so here, I'm not so concerned, because even if that pension did go completely belly up,
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.160]   which is, of course, very unlikely, but let's say it went completely belly up,
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.760]   you're going to be fine, right? You would still have enough other assets growing. You're young,
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.600]   you have time, you have other assets that can grow potentially significantly, you're good savers.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.760]   I'm not too worried about it. And so I wouldn't just take the money and run.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.680]   What I would do is I would try to get a sense of what this pension is actually worth in the open
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.360]   market. So you would take the value and you'd say, "Okay, let's say I took $140,000. What would I do
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.880]   with it?" And here's where you need to do some math. If I take $140,000, roll it into an IRA,
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:54.000]   what would that money potentially grow to by 65, using what I understand to be appropriate
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.600]   numbers? And what you're trying to do is you're trying to get a sense of how good
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:05.200]   the returns that are being promised to you are. So you need to project, "All right, at 65,
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.800]   they would pay me $1,500 per month. Is that affected? Is there an inflation rider? Is there
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:17.280]   not an inflation rider? How much of a return would I need to get from my stocks if I take the $140,000,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.160]   put it into the stocks in order to have the same amount of money available to me for my portfolio?"
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:28.640]   I would also compare this to a private annuity. I would sit down with an insurance salesman,
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.600]   and I would run some numbers on an annuity. Because I think that if you run numbers on an
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.840]   annuity, you're getting an apples to apples comparison. The problem with just saying,
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.600]   "I'm going to take the money and put it in stocks," is that a pension is much more valuable
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:50.480]   than a stock account. Because a pension has a guaranteed income benefit. It comes in every
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.040]   month, no matter what happens to the stock market. It comes in every month for the rest of your life
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.000]   if you take it as an income. Whereas the stocks, you can outlive them. It comes in potentially
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.920]   every month for the rest of your life and for the rest of your wife's life. It comes in oftentimes
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.880]   with a cost of living adjustment rider on it, inflation rider. And so it's extraordinarily
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.320]   valuable. And so what I would do, if possible, if you can find an insurance agent who will quote
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:21.360]   some annuities for you, is I would try to get a sense of what the annuity cost would be for me to
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:27.760]   get an annuity that's equivalent to this annuity that they have for you. Probably a lot higher than
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:35.120]   $140,000. Most of the time it is. So in general, when you run the numbers, usually what you find
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.440]   is that your employer pension is much more valuable than almost anything else you can do with
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:49.280]   the money. Because the numbers of that guaranteed benefit work out really well.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.760]   So I would guess, this is just a guess, but having done this a number of times, I would guess that
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:03.120]   the answer is going to be keep the money in the Ohio pension system, just leave it alone,
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:11.120]   and it's going to grow to be a good amount of money. Assuming that Ohio doesn't go bankrupt,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.160]   which I don't think it is, it's not as poorly managed as say Illinois,
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.040]   then it's probably going to be fine. And then this will provide you with a very useful
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.520]   backup plan to the rest of your portfolio. And potentially you just view this as some
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:31.280]   of your fixed income or some of your cash of your overall portfolio. And I think that being
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.840]   in your mid-30s with another $760,000 of investable assets, I think that's plenty to have available
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.040]   to invest in stocks. I'm probably going to keep it. I'm going to leave it alone. I'm just going
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:48.160]   to have it there as a long-term retirement benefit. Okay. That's very helpful. I was just
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:55.840]   curious, is there a quick resource or formula I could search for to find the total cash value
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.320]   of my pension, like looking at projected benefits and things? No, you would have to,
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:04.400]   you mean the current present value of those benefits down the road?
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.040]   Correct. There's no quick formula. You can put it into a, I mean, I could do it on a financial
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.240]   calculator. So if you can find someone who can run a financial calculator for you, you can do it.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:23.600]   You can build a spreadsheet for it and do it that way. It's not hard to do. All you need to do is,
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.440]   I mean, no, I'm not going to do it right now. Call me up on another show and I can do it for you
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.480]   on the show. And it's kind of a semi, it'd be pretty boring audio. All you need to do,
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.400]   okay, so it's just two, if you don't know how to run a financial calculator, you're a teacher,
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:44.000]   go ahead and do it. Actually, someone is telling me on the chat, John says on the chat of this call
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.760]   that ChooseFi just did an episode on Monday on pension calculations. So go check out what they
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.400]   did. Maybe that would be helpful for you. Oh, okay. Perfect.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:57.840]   What I would do is take your stream of payments and let's just say, okay, at 65, I'm going to
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:05.040]   get $1,000 a month. Then use, decide what time range you're going to choose to value that as.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:13.280]   So I'm going to take it from 65 to 75 or from 65 to 105. Then what you need to do is you're going
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.040]   to do a present value calculation starting at the age of 65. So you calculate your stream of payments,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.800]   your terminal value is zero, so your ending value is zero. You calculate your stream of payments,
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:31.120]   you adjust those payments based upon whether they have a cost of living adjustment in them. So if
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.520]   they have a 3% benefit or something like that, you maybe you inflate the payments at 3% to get
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:39.280]   your total present value. So you first calculate... This one does not.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:45.920]   Okay, so then it's even easier. So calculate your present value at age 65 and then discount
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:52.800]   that present value to today, to your current age, say 35. So you take a 30-year discount for today
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.840]   to $140,000 and that'll give you your projected rate of return over the course of the next 30
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.120]   years. So it's just two very simple present value calculations. You first do a present value
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.880]   calculation of the pension stream at the date of receiving income, say 65, and then you discount
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.840]   that. You make that your future value and then you discount that today based upon your discount rate.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.120]   Okay, great.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.400]   Great. And where are you going to teach? You said you're going abroad. Where are you headed?
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   Tokyo.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.280]   Fun. Enjoy.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.120]   Very cool. A lot of people love Tokyo. I hope to be there
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.760]   potentially later this year. So we'll see what happens. All right, we go now to...
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:41.520]   Just a moment. We'll go back to John. John has his headset. Should have a headset. John,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.000]   are you there?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.640]   Hopefully.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.200]   Yeah, you're in.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.080]   50/50.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.000]   You're in. How can I serve you today, John?
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.920]   You kind of touched on it when you were talking to Kate earlier. So I just recently
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.640]   got out of the military last year. Basically tripled my income overnight. Kind of grew up poor,
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.480]   so it's been completely disorienting being able to afford everything that I've ever wanted.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:12.320]   Wanted resources, books or whatever on kind of dealing with that mindset shift, I guess.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.760]   Yeah, don't know how to better phrase it than that.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.600]   I don't know if it's books. I'm blanking on a book just to say that...
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:29.680]   Yeah, I don't know if there's a book. But what I think there is, is just simply
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:37.440]   you basically make your own. You recognize the changes that you're experiencing in your own life
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:44.320]   and then my strategy is simply get it out of your head. Get those experiences, get those thoughts
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:50.880]   out of your head to where you can actually analyze them. So you write them down. Are you struggling
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.240]   with spending too much money? Are you struggling with saving too much money? Is there some way that
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.000]   you feel you're handling this transition poorly? I'm definitely overspending and that's curbed a
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.040]   bit. But yeah, I don't know. It's hard to describe other than just disorienting.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.760]   I was making like $50,000 a year six months ago.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.440]   Right. And now you're making $150,000?
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:20.320]   Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know that it's a bad thing to splurge a little bit. I really don't.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:28.240]   As long as a lot of those splurges don't kind of lock you in. So maybe we'll just talk about
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.280]   a few of the things that happen. You can recognize, first of all, recognize that what you're going
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:39.440]   through is common to lots and lots of people. But you personally are handling it better than
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.880]   lots of people handle it because you're listening to a personal finance podcast like mine
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.120]   I'm sure you're listening to others looking for other resources and you're doing something like
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.880]   calling in and talking about it with someone like me. And so just that you should give yourself a
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.240]   pat on the back right there because just that act, that practice is probably enough to avert
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:05.760]   disaster for you personally. When people come into a lot of money, there is a temptation to
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.880]   start spending it all. And my answer is spend some but not all. I think that there can be danger
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:19.440]   points, kind of like two gutters of a bowling lane. Gutter number one on the left is don't
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.240]   spend any of it. And that can be really frustrating because you've worked hard to take yourself from
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.680]   an income of $50,000 to $150,000. And I don't see why you wouldn't reward yourself for that hard
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:36.800]   work. But gutter number two is if you go from $150,000 and now you lock in $180,000 per year
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:42.560]   spending lifestyle, then now all of a sudden that's also going to be a disaster. And certainly
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.680]   that's your bigger risk. And so how much money have you spent in the last six months? How much
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.800]   money have you made in the last six months and how much money have you spent in the last six months?
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.560]   Oh God, I'd have to do the math. I mean- Ballpark.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:01.520]   Six, yeah, 6,400 after taxes every month and then I've maybe saved 10 grand of that.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.360]   Okay. So you haven't spent more than you've earned in the last six months. Is that right?
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.320]   Right. I think so.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.880]   You don't have more debt today than you had six months ago. Is that right?
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.080]   With the exception of a mortgage, yes.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.560]   Okay. So mortgage is kind of a unique thing. So the first thing that you want to do is you
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.440]   want to avoid debt or at least you want to avoid debt that's not secured by property.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:30.160]   So you want your net worth to increase. Has your net worth increased over the last six months?
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.520]   Oh yeah.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.440]   Good. Okay. So you're doing the things right. So that's the first thing is as long as your net
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.720]   worth is increasing, you're doing okay. The second thing I would say is what you want to
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.360]   be cautious about is am I buying things that are going to go down in value or buying things that
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.320]   are going to go up in value? So if you've gotten a mortgage and that's a good asset and there's
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.160]   good debt associated with it, then you've bought something that's probably going to increase in
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.640]   value. That's different than going out and buying a new car that is going to go down in value and
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.680]   having debt on the new car. So where people really screw it up is if they lock themselves in and they
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:12.160]   start buying stuff that's going to go down in value, furs, jewelry, cars, things like that.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.640]   So avoid that. I think the other thing that you want to look at is am I locking myself into a
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.280]   higher level of expenses for life or for a long time or these temporary consumption items? So
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:29.520]   I would spend $6,000 to go skiing for a week if I wanted to go skiing. That's a one-time expense.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.680]   I know I'm spending a lot of money. I'm going skiing and I'm going to have a great week of
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:38.320]   vacation. This is going to be fun. But what I wouldn't do is go out and sign myself up for
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.280]   a payment on a new car of $1,200 a month because now I'm going to be paying for that for the next
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:51.760]   six years. And so that's going to be kind of a lock-in. And yeah, so those are the errors to
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:57.280]   avoid. Where I think you solve it is the same. It doesn't matter where you came from. It doesn't
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.240]   matter that you grew up poor. What it comes down to is what's my vision going forward? What are
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:06.000]   my dreams going forward? What's the kind of lifestyle that I want to live? You heard me when
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.160]   I mentioned with the first, I think the first or second caller, I talked about the three questions
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:16.080]   and I talked about getting yourself settled. If you've gotten yourself into a much higher earning
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.560]   job, then I think the first step is, number one, who do I want to be with? Number two,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.720]   where do I want to be? Number three, what kind of work do I want to do? And make sure that those
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.280]   things are right. Ask yourself, do I like this work? If I like this work, great. Buying a house,
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.720]   great. Settle your life. And then after you settle your life in as best you can, then build a
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.520]   financial plan up. I'm just going to, I'm going to save 20% of my income. And it should be pretty
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.920]   easy for you to save 20% of my income. What I would suggest for you is, I think just because
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.160]   of the simple rule, there's nothing magical about it. Save half, spend half. So if you went from 50
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:57.680]   to 150, recognize that what you can do, I'm ignoring taxes here, but save half of the
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:03.360]   increase and spend half of the increase. So if you've added $100,000 to your income,
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.760]   then set up your finances now so that you're saving $50,000 per year, and then add another
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:16.880]   $50,000 per year of spending. And to me, that's the right number, is you double your lifestyle,
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:24.320]   which will be a big, very welcome, fun change. But you also are increasing your savings. And I
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.680]   don't, I think that's kind of the prudent middle road. It's not too extreme where you're living
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.160]   like a miser. It's not where you're spending too much money. Just as your income goes up,
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:35.920]   save half, spend half. That way you double your lifestyle and you double your savings.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.080]   - Gotcha. Makes sense.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:43.520]   - Anything else? That's all I got.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.600]   - No, I wish I had more.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.920]   - Well, Colin, let's keep in touch as you work it through. And by the way, congratulations.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:53.040]   What kind of work, so you went from the military, what kind of work did you go into
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:53.840]   out of the military?
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:58.480]   - Yeah, so I was a network engineer in the military, jumped into software.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.120]   - Perfect.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.360]   - Yeah, dropped out of college, got a bachelor's and master's in the military. So
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:03.680]   - Well done.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.040]   - Weird path, but it turned out.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.800]   - Well done. I'm glad it worked out for you.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.040]   - Thank you.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.120]   - All right, we go on to Memphis, Tennessee. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:16.560]   - Hey, Josh, I missed the first part of your call. I hope this doesn't repeat any questions.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.840]   I got a stock market question for you.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.400]   - Go ahead.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:28.720]   - I just broke a million dollars in the stock market. It's 70%. Yeah. The 70%
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.560]   stocks and about 30% treasuries. I've been 100% stocks for 20 years.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:38.400]   I feel like the market's their value. And I'm not on Facebook, but I've gotten the impression that
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.720]   you've been talking to people on Facebook and that you're out of market. And I was thinking about
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.360]   Dallio's all weather portfolio and the permanent portfolio theory, which we talked about before.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.200]   And so my question for you is, you know, Dallio's negative on Barnes now. What do you think of
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.200]   Dallio's all weather? What do you think of the permanent portfolio in today's market?
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:04.000]   And whatever value or is it just reflecting inflation? And then I want to know if you're
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.360]   out, where'd you move your money? - I am not competent to say what the market
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:21.040]   is going to be some months from now or not. I tend to look at things and it feels if where we are
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:27.600]   right now isn't a bubble, then I don't know what a bubble would feel like or how you would predict
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:36.320]   a bubble. That's where I'm at right now. So if I just see too much evidence to say that,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:43.120]   to look at the world and just, again, I said it the way I want to say it. If where we're at right
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:51.360]   now is not inflated, if we're not in some kind of valuation bubble, then I don't know what a bubble
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:58.240]   would look like or what it would feel like. So maybe the things are different, right? I've
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.440]   asked myself a lot of these questions over the last couple of years. Maybe things are different
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:07.200]   now because there's more people participating in the stock market than ever before. I don't know.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.200]   I think that there's a lot of money in stocks because there's not really, there's a lot of
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:16.160]   money forced into stocks because you can't get any return on your money in the bank. That's part
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.800]   of the whole reason why you have interest rates at these artificially low prices. It doesn't make
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.720]   sense to me from the perspective, broadly speaking, a lot of things don't make sense to me from a
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:30.960]   fundamental perspective. But because I don't know whether, where we're going to be, three or six
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:37.280]   months, et cetera, the only safe place I've ever found to plant my feet in any of this is what I
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:44.160]   call financial planning, which is simply the old, the same wisdom reflected in the idea that you
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.080]   invest money in the stock markets that you're not going to spend in the next five years. So where
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:52.320]   are we going to be five years from now? If I had to bet, I would bet that markets will be higher
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.760]   five years from now than where they are today. That doesn't mean, however, that they were going
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.080]   to be higher a year from now. And so I'm happy to bet that they'll be higher five years from now.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:08.320]   And so if you've got a five-year time horizon, I wouldn't run away. The second thing is, if you're
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.480]   going to get out, you've got to have something to go to. So you've got to have some kind of personal
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.280]   strategy, some kind of personal plan that makes sense to you of what you're going to go to.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:24.160]   Getting out to go to cash, unless you have a specific metric that you're watching, a particular
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.920]   strategy that you have in mind of, or a specific company that you want to work in, just doesn't
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:34.880]   work. That kind of fear-based run for the hills doesn't work when you get to investing. And so
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.040]   if you need some money in the cash to sleep well, maybe you've got a million dollars and you need
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.280]   to put $200,000 in the bank because that's the money that makes you sleep well at night so that
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:49.120]   you could let the other $800,000 ride, go for it. Again, I can plant my feet very firmly on these
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.200]   personal financial planning techniques to say, how much money do you need in the bank to sleep well?
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.040]   Now, where do you go? I think that you need to develop something that would make you feel good.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.600]   If you feel good having an all-weather portfolio, I think you should do that.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.480]   If you feel good having a permanent portfolio, I think you should do that. I think that those
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:20.160]   portfolios can make a lot of people feel better than a 100% stock portfolio because they solve
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.240]   these needs, they solve these fears. If I know that I've got $200,000 in gold coins sitting
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:32.480]   somewhere, and if I know that I've got $200,000 in long-term treasuries, and if I know I've got,
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.760]   going on down the list, if I know I've got $200,000 in cash, then I'm not worried so much
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.360]   about all the money in the portfolio. And so I like those strategies. I like any strategy that
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:49.680]   somebody believes in that makes sense to them based upon their numbers because what you've got
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.440]   to make sure you have is a plan that's not made in the heat of battle but that's made beforehand
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.080]   so that when the market starts tumbling, you know what you're going to do with it.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:04.960]   So if you told me I'm going to take a million dollars and I've got my eye on 10 companies
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:09.520]   that I've worked out a value estimate of what I think these companies are worth per share,
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.360]   and so I'm going to just wait and I'm going to watch my pick list, and when their value
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.360]   is go below – when their share prices go below what I think they're worth, I'm going to go ahead
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:25.520]   and start buying. I'm convinced, yeah, that makes sense. But I think that you want to go in that
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:32.160]   direction instead. My reasons for getting out of the stock market were primarily personal financial
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:40.560]   planning reasons and personal philosophical problems, not valuations. I sold stocks far
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:46.960]   below what they are now. So if we're counting how Joshua's stock getting out of the stock market
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.800]   thing did, I got out lower than where they are right now. But I don't regret that personally
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.400]   because I didn't make the decision based on valuations. I didn't predict a crash and then
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:03.200]   get out. I made the decision because I object philosophically and morally to many of the actions
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:11.520]   that the companies were taking with my money and I didn't want to have their blood on my hands.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:19.120]   And number two, when looking at my personal financial plan, I realized that stocks were
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:25.840]   much less likely to ever make me wealthy than other things that I could do. And so after years
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.960]   of selling stocks, I realized that stocks very rarely make anybody rich, meaning mainstream
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:38.720]   stocks. And so what I decided to do was to pursue – I guess we could call it a barbell strategy,
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:44.960]   right? Where – no, that wouldn't be the right characterization. I basically decided to say,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:54.400]   "I want to bet on myself and on my personal abilities, not the stock market. I want to bet
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.600]   on my own businesses that I can build. I want to bet on my own businesses that I can turn around
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:05.040]   because I believe that I can make tens of millions of dollars per year if I invest my own money
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:11.520]   rather than giving it to Wall Street to invest." And so when that's compounded with my own personal
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.800]   philosophical frustrations with the way that many large companies conduct their affairs,
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.080]   then I'm satisfied with my decision. But I don't think that's right for most people.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:27.220]   Make sense?
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:34.960]   Yeah, it does. I appreciate it. Yeah, I can sympathize with the moral positions of the
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:39.520]   companies that you're on a part of. That's a part of it, but it's more that it seems like there's a
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:44.480]   great deal of exuberance that there's about the markets and there's a time to make a decision
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:48.400]   and be now rather than at the most depressed points of the market.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:55.920]   I don't disagree with you. And one thing – forgive me for interrupting you. I am trying to – I'm
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:01.120]   trying in my response to you, and I want to make this crystal clear because an expert investor will
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:07.760]   recognize what I'm doing, but I'm trying to respond and tread a very thin line here.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:15.760]   All academic research indicates that the average investor has no ability to predict the direction
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   of the markets, generally speaking. So that's the general academic consensus. And because I'm
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.400]   somebody who believes in the power of academic research, who believes in the power of good data,
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:34.960]   that influences my decisions, is that I always question myself. Do I think I'm smarter? Do I
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:41.200]   think I can time the market? The data indicates that I probably can't. Now, the other fine line
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:47.840]   is that I have spoken to many people who can make good investment decisions. I've known enough
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:53.760]   people, clients of mine, listeners of mine, who are very keen traders. But the key is you have
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.400]   to have a strategy that you understand and know what you're doing. And so I feel a sense of
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:03.200]   professional responsibility that if you're not calling me up – and like the people who can do
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.200]   it aren't calling me and asking me if the stock market is overvalued. They're just doing it based
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.680]   upon, "Hey, I've researched this. I understand this strategy. My metric says that this is not
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.800]   a winning strategy, and I'm going to pay it, bail and go out." And so this is a very complicated
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:21.920]   world for me to live in because if the average person calls me up and says, "I got a 401(k),"
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.360]   well, the answer is buy and hold, right? Buy and hold. But buy and hold really sucks a lot of times,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.040]   and it's really painful, and I don't believe that you have to buy and hold to win.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:36.720]   And so I'm trying to thread this narrow path between these to say, "You need to understand
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:42.240]   your own strategy. I personally think stocks are overvalued, but since I don't have any skin in the
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.920]   game in the moment, it's easy for me to say that because my businesses are doing fine, and I'm not
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.600]   interested – that interested at the moment – in buying more stocks because I think that there are
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.720]   far more interesting ways and places to make money in the world than the U.S. stock market."
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.040]   So I hope that that's clear. I'm trying to make it very obvious that I'm trying to thread a line
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.200]   between the academic research that says you should buy and hold and we shouldn't try to predict
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.000]   whether stocks are overvalued while also recognizing that I think individuals can
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.840]   actually look at their situation and say, "Hey, this doesn't make any sense,"
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.520]   and then it's your money. No one's going to care about it. You do what you need to do to sleep well
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:30.960]   at night. Right. There is some psychology there because if the stock is not a true value, then
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.960]   trying to sell is to capture a gain. It wasn't really yours to begin with.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.360]   So I can understand the psychology of the buy and hold. It doesn't really matter if it goes up or
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:44.240]   down. Eventually, it's going to reflect true value. It just may be a number smaller than what you have
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:49.360]   right now. But I was trying to think of something that was a little bit more durable and less
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.760]   fluctuation at the height. Do you have any idea why Dallier is so negative on bonds right now?
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:59.520]   Is he talking about government bonds or is he talking about corporate bonds?
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:06.080]   I haven't followed exactly what he has said, but the reason why anybody would be negative on bonds
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:15.280]   right now is obvious. With interest rates at depressed historical lows for a very long period
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:24.080]   of time, with expansionary money supplies and economic crises, it's hard to believe that
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:32.720]   interest rates can be kept down for the long term. If interest rates rise, then bond prices will fall.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:40.080]   So prices of bonds – sorry, value of bonds and interest rates always work in an inverse
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:47.840]   correlation. If interest rates go up, the value of bonds fall. If interest rates fall, the value
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:53.280]   of bonds increase because that's the relationship between them because it's on what companies can
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:36:01.440]   refinance themselves at. So any investor who's looking at the world would say at some point in
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:06.720]   time, interest rates are going to have to increase, whether that's because we're in an
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:13.440]   inflationary environment due to excessive supplies of money. You can argue your own thing, but then
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.720]   in that scenario, bond prices would fall. So that would be, without having seen what Dallier has
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.880]   written recently, that's the answer as to why any person would be bearish on bonds at the moment.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:31.200]   Okay. Yeah, that was a gist of it. Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks for your help.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:40.880]   Yeah. So my only comment would be I do like these structured portfolios like all-weather portfolio,
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:48.960]   like permanent portfolio, because they're designed to solve these mental problems you're
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:55.120]   wrestling with. You can think about what you think is the best, but they are fundamentally designed
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:01.520]   to try to alleviate this sense of agitation that you have because they allow you to say,
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:06.160]   "Listen, we don't know what's going to happen in the future, but we know that by diversifying our
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:13.360]   assets across these different asset classes, we can participate in where there's growth,
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   and we can limit the decreases where there are declines, and they allow you to sleep well at
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.040]   night." And so you need to find a model that you believe in that will allow you to sleep well at
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:31.120]   night so that also fits your personal financial goals, your personal financial constraints.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.840]   You need to find something you believe in so that when the market goes up and down,
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.640]   you're going to be happy and comfortable with it. And whatever that model is, is up to you
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.440]   to decide, but that's what you need so that you don't bail at a bad time.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:54.880]   Thanks, Joshua. I appreciate it. Always enjoy listening to your insights.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.440]   My pleasure. Thank you for being here. All right, two callers left. We go to California. Welcome
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.840]   to the show. How can I serve you today? I think that's me. My name is James.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.320]   Tell me your name again, please. James.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.400]   James, glad you're here. Go ahead, sir. Yeah. So I'm in California. I have concerns
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:19.760]   about California and the US. I'm not looking to move. I'm running the family farming operation,
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:26.880]   but I'm looking to build ties to other countries specifically and kind of understand where I should
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.480]   go with that. I kind of got two ends of this. My wife is from Belarus and I enjoy Eastern Europe
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:37.920]   and that, but I don't really see any opportunities there. The visa stuff and that's not real appealing.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:44.640]   There's also countries like Panama and Malaysia and whatnot that offer appealing visa and
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.720]   investment things, but I don't have any particular ties to these countries or
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.240]   other interests in them aside from these programs they offer. So I'm kind of going back and forth
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   between these things and wondered your thoughts on building ties to other countries and
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.560]   how to pick where to go to. Okay. So let me give you a couple of models that you can apply.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.360]   So the first thing is you are living in California. You're running a business that
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:15.120]   simply cannot easily be relocated. You're running a farm and you're happy doing that.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.360]   And while you might be a little bit annoyed with some of the trends that are affecting you
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.120]   personally, while you might be a little bit concerned about the future, you're not going
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:30.400]   to pick up and go and start a farm in Belarus. Okay. So if that's the first, agreed, do I
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.200]   understand correctly? That is the situation. Perfect. Okay. So in this situation, we're just
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:43.120]   simply doing plan B planning, right? While things are not bad enough that we want to leave, we could
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.760]   actually understand that in theory, there's a point in time at which things could get bad enough
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.280]   that we would actually want to leave. And so if that happened, it would be better to have a plan
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:00.720]   in place beforehand rather than waiting for the last minute. We don't want to be on the last train
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:06.160]   out wondering if we have enough pieces of jewelry sewn into the lining of our coat to bribe the
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:11.360]   guards to let us out. Right. Better to be a little bit early and not be on that last train. So we're
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:17.760]   trying to do plan B planning. Okay. So let me break it into some components because the reason
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   this is overwhelming to you is simply that you don't, first of all, it needs to be broken down
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:29.520]   into small pieces and then you need some ideas that are available to you. So I think the most
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:36.640]   useful opportunity for you with regard to personal international planning, sorry, the most useful
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   model is simply the classic five flag theory. The classic theory that Harry Schultz invented back in
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:51.280]   the 80s of the PT theory, flat flag theory. And so what he would teach is that there are five basic
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.720]   flags that you can plant around the world. And so you have your citizenship flag, what country are
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:03.120]   you a citizen of? You have your residency flag, what country are you a resident of? You have your
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:09.760]   banking flag, where do you store your money? You have your business flag, where do you operate your
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:14.880]   business? And then you have, they would call it your playground flag, which I'm happy to use.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.960]   You can just simply call it your living flag. Your playground is what they would say. Where do
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:24.400]   you like to go and spend time? And so the challenge is when you do international planning is that
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.440]   right now all five of those things are related. So you have your citizenship in the United States,
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.200]   you have your residency in the United States and in California. You probably have most of your
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.600]   money in the United States, your business is in the United States and you spend most of your time
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.360]   in the United States. So you can start to decouple those one at a time. So with regard to citizenship,
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:49.040]   you probably don't have to have a second citizenship. But I do think it's very valuable
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.920]   if you could have it. If things got really bad, the most important thing for you would be to have
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.120]   a residency. And so you might want to just think about where would I actually want to go? Let's say
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.360]   that things got bad in California. Imagine a scenario in which it would be bad enough to make
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.240]   you want to leave California. I don't know what it is, I don't know what you're worried about,
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:12.400]   but just imagine a scenario where you say, "If they did this, I would leave. If they did this,
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.040]   I would leave." And then ask yourself, "Where would I want to go?" Now, if you don't have an
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:23.040]   answer for that, then just say, "I don't know where I would want to go." And start looking around.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:30.800]   Would I want to go from California to Nevada? Would I want to go to Utah? Would I go to Colorado,
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.680]   Montana? Would I go to Texas, Florida, South Dakota, North Dakota, et cetera? One thing you
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:41.440]   can do is you can just very easily diversify some of your life and your business inside the United
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:46.560]   States. So you might have most of your property in California, but maybe you could afford to buy
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.800]   a little bit more land. Maybe you buy a little piece of land in another state. That would be
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:57.520]   one option for you. If you don't know where else you would go, then think about more broadly. Do
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.800]   you like going to Mexico? Do you like going to Canada? Do you like going to Panama? Have you
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:06.720]   ever been there? If not, if you haven't ever been to any of those places, then the first thing to do
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.720]   is just book yourself a vacation and get on an airplane and go. And go spend a little time in
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.480]   Alberta and say, "Well, maybe I would like to buy a ranch here in Alberta. Maybe I'd like to buy some
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.440]   farmland in Mexico. Maybe I'd like Panama City, et cetera." And just think about some different
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.680]   places. And if you're going to get residency, try to get residency in a place you'd actually want
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:29.760]   to spend some time because you might actually wind up spending some time there. The easiest flag to
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:36.160]   move is your banking flag. It's very easy to go and open a bank account. It's not hard at all. You
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:40.640]   just simply choose a country that will allow you as a tourist to come in and open a bank account.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:45.760]   You go there, you open a bank account, then you fly home and you wire money into the bank account.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.640]   And so everybody should have at least one account outside of their country of residence.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:56.720]   If you have substantial reserves, you can think about moving more of those reserves.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:03.200]   Now, this gets complicated depending on how those reserves are held. If you have a million dollars
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.120]   in your bank account, you can move easily a million dollars from the United States to a
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.640]   million dollars in a foreign bank account in practically any high-quality banking jurisdiction
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.920]   in the world. If you have a million dollars in your 401(k), it doesn't work so well. And so you
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.640]   have to look at what assets you have, but you have to think about where you store your money.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.200]   With regard to your business, you want to analyze your business and say,
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:32.160]   "Is there an opportunity that I have to move my business or any part of my business?"
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:40.160]   So, do I want to have something going in Mexico? Do I want to have something going in Guatemala?
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.560]   Do I want to have something going in Brazil? Do I want to buy farmland? Is that the kind of guy I am?
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.880]   Or if not, let me just ignore it for now.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:56.240]   This is hard with farming because you're trying to use a productive piece of land, and usually
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.960]   farmer's shadow is the best fertilizer. So, it's not the kind of thing that's easily run from
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:05.520]   abroad. But there can be the kind of thing where you might set up operations in other places and
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:13.760]   move some component of your business. Residency, you could, if you were going to buy land, you can
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:19.040]   often use land to negotiate a residency for you. So, there are many places in the world that if
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.840]   you have money and you want to buy some farmland, you can come in and you can use that purchase to
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:27.600]   actually get yourself a legal residency. So, you can come and go back and forth. I don't know if
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.640]   that works with the style of farming or with your personal lifestyle interest, but that's something
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:37.120]   you can do. On the citizenship front, there's no downside to having a Belarusian citizenship.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.720]   Your wife is Belarusian?
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.560]   Yes. I've looked into it and it doesn't look like there's a way I could be without
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.400]   moving there for like a decade.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:51.840]   Right. Yeah, they're probably pretty tight given the culture of Belarus. So,
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:56.880]   can you get a residence permit in Belarus?
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:03.680]   I don't. I should look into that further. I think I'd have to be working there too.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:09.120]   Because I'm married to a citizen, under the current rules, I could go there on a tourist
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:15.600]   visa and then file paperwork once there to stay there and work. There's no way I've found to line
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.560]   it up in advance. Of course, no guarantee they won't change the rules, but those are the current
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.060]   rules.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:27.280]   Right. So, if possible, I would try to go ahead and negotiate a residence permit for you,
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.800]   simply being married to your wife, so that if you ever did need or want to go there,
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.400]   you have that as an option. And then I would look and see how worth it is to get at other places.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:42.560]   My answer is, if you're in California, you should get a Mexican residence permit. I think that's
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.760]   the obvious first step. You go to the Mexican consulate, you say, "Look, I have enough money
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.160]   in the bank. I can get a person of means visa." They give you a person of means visa. You go into
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:57.120]   Mexico, you do the conje, turn it into a temporary permit. You go and take your vacations in Mexico
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:00.560]   every year for five years, you become a permanent resident of Mexico. Now you can always go to
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:06.640]   Mexico. So, that would be, I think, the simplest thing to do. And then, as a farmer, there'd
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:13.120]   probably be a lot of options for you in terms of potentially moving things to Mexico. Where I would
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.600]   spend most of my time is I would just spend most of my time not on necessarily each of these details
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.880]   because they're so hard for you as a farmer, but I would spend time investigating and saying,
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:30.400]   "Is there more opportunity somewhere else?" Probably it's going to be hard for you to find.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.200]   Farming is a pretty good deal in the United States, especially in California, you've got
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.720]   great weather, you've got tremendous subsidies, tremendous support. You're probably not going to
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.960]   be the guy who's going to be out leading the front on international relocation. But what you might do
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.920]   is just simply look and keep your ears open for other opportunities. Maybe a year or two from now
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:59.280]   you buy some farmland in Venezuela. Maybe, I don't know, but if you don't have something better,
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.720]   there's no reason to leave where you are, work your way through those five flags and see,
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:10.080]   "Okay, can I get another citizenship somewhere? Do I qualify for something in my own family? If not,
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:15.440]   am I willing to pay for it to buy one? Is it worth it to me? Do I think that the concern is
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.600]   significant enough? What if I just get a residency permit?" I think for most people,
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.600]   having a residency permit in Mexico or in Panama or someplace simple like that,
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.880]   maybe you get yourself a little condo in Colombia, get a residence permit there that can lead to
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:35.840]   citizenship. I think that's sufficient for most people. But think about how you would get out of
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:43.920]   the farm at some point in time if you needed to. >> Yeah. Okay. Well, that's helpful. I've
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:51.280]   looked all over the world and done business in Chile and in Spain and haven't found anything
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:55.760]   better but then have concerns with where I'm at. So I've been trying those two.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:01.920]   >> It's really hard. And it's a lot easier for a guy like me with an internet business to just
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.400]   trot all around the world and to wax eloquent about how great internationalization is. I like
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.600]   it, right? But that's very different than if you're a farmer and you're tied to land.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.440]   The last thing I was going to say is you should consider disentangling yourself from the land.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.800]   So I don't know with your particular farm whether this would work. And this is also hard because of
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:27.360]   the taxes usually embedded in most farm property. But if you see that things, let's say that you're
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:33.520]   looking at it around and you're saying things are going badly, all right? What you do is start
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:38.640]   stripping your equity from the place where things are going badly and try to move it to a place
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:43.600]   where things are going better. And so here, the obvious example is can you go ahead and mortgage
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.360]   up your farm and then go ahead and move that money somewhere else? You don't want to endanger
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.920]   your business, but if you can mortgage up your farm and move that money somewhere else, then that
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:59.920]   could potentially be very helpful for you in the future. And that would help to protect your biggest
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.280]   asset. So I would look very carefully at mortgaging my farm and see what I could do to strip some of
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:13.200]   the equity there and if I have a better place to put it. Okay. For sure. All right. Well,
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:17.920]   that was my question. I've got some things to look on. If I remember right, Harry Schulte
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:22.720]   has wrote a couple of books on Flagsters. Is that correct? Yeah, it wasn't Schulte himself
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:29.760]   who wrote them. It was another author. I'll look up his name here for a moment. W.G. Hill was the
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.800]   name he wrote under. He wrote a number of books. He wrote a book called PT. He wrote a book under
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:42.080]   that label. He wrote a book called The Invisible Investor. He wrote a book on second passports, etc.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:50.800]   Later under another pen name, he wrote a book called something about escaping big brother.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:56.480]   But they're good. You can find them online. You can find them. I read them all and they're quite
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.240]   fun. They're just at the end of the day, your constraint is going to be your farming operation.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.040]   You're not a good candidate. You're not a good candidate for that kind of globe-trotting
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:13.120]   lifestyle if you are required to be there with the land. And so your options are more limited
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.400]   than they are for some other people. What do you do? Let me run through them again real fast.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.880]   Okay, number one, you can strip the equity off your farm, move the equity somewhere else if you
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:25.440]   have to be there. You can redesign your farming operations so that they can flourish without you
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:29.840]   physically being there and you can start another operation somewhere else. Maybe you can start a
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:35.280]   farming operation in Chile and then you spend 20% of your time in California, 80% of your time in
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:41.280]   Chile. Or you can just be prepared and watching for what those factors would be when things got
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:46.560]   bad enough that you would actually would want to sell your land and move. But I think the biggest
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:52.000]   challenge is you're tied to the land and so the threats would have to be pretty big for it to be
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.320]   worth it for you to pull the trigger, sell your land, move your equipment operations elsewhere.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:03.200]   They have to be pretty big. Okay, well thank you much. Wish I had better answers. And with that,
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.400]   appropriately enough, we move on to, well you said anonymous, we'll go with Kevin. It's easier.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:13.360]   I feel a little bit weird saying welcome to the show anonymous. So go ahead, Kevin.
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:15.920]   Kevin's good. Can you hear me?
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:21.280]   Yeah, I'm not so into, yeah, absolutely I can hear you. It makes me feel more normal talking
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:24.480]   to Kevin than it does talking to anonymous, like my screen says.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:26.160]   Perfect. Well, I'll be Kevin then.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:26.660]   Good.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:33.600]   So I guess two questions. I'll give you what might be the shorter one first. Going into
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:39.120]   a business with a family member, close family member, no concern that they will
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:49.120]   up and leave or rip me off or anything. They will be full time working toward this business
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:59.040]   before, well, coming up here pretty soon. And in terms of compensation, would it be beneficial
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:10.240]   for me to pay them out of, in another way, via a tax free gift or using other funds or to have
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:15.360]   them as a registered employee of the business? What would be the advantage of doing either?
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.000]   What is the relationship between you and the family member?
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.120]   It's a parent.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:27.520]   Okay. So let's stick to the letter of the law to start with.
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:29.140]   Okay.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:38.160]   When somebody works for you and they receive compensation, then that's compensation.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:44.080]   Compensation is compensation no matter how it is structured. And the way that they should be
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:51.760]   compensated is very carefully and legally defined. For example, if so and so is a contractor,
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:56.080]   there are a set of guidelines that you can look at and say, yep, this person is a contractor.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:59.200]   On the other hand, if someone is an employee, there are a set of guidelines that you can look
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:03.840]   at that are pretty clear. This is an employee. There's not a lot of gray zone between who is
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:11.040]   a contractor and who is an employee. And so it's fairly self-evident. If you read the criteria for
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:16.560]   a contractor versus an employee, it's fairly self-evident. Now, depending on someone's
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:21.360]   relationship with you in the business, then the way that they're compensated from the business
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.320]   will be fairly obvious. You can make them an employee of the business or you can make them
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:34.800]   an owner in the business. Either is fine. But the actual legal impact of each of those decisions is
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:39.440]   certainly self-evident and obvious. If they're an employee, they're going to receive wages.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.640]   If they're an owner, they're going to receive profits and dividends from the company. And so
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:50.160]   all of the tax characteristics of that transfer are going to be quite obvious.
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:58.320]   The only benefit for a family member working for another family member, I guess we should note that
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.760]   if you have a minor child who is working for you, then there are some tiny little benefits. For
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:08.640]   example, you can avoid paying employment taxes for a minor child that's working for you in a
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.760]   sole proprietorship and maybe in another structure too. I can't remember the rule on that right now.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.120]   But that's not going to apply with a parent. What you can, of course, do is you can
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:26.720]   have somebody who is working for you that's being paid a relatively high wage for a relatively easy
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:34.480]   go of it. Now, you can't abuse it. There's the old saying, "Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered."
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:40.080]   And I think the same thing applies here. If your father is working for your business and he shows
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:47.280]   up to the office one hour per month, but he receives a paycheck of $100,000 per month,
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:57.760]   then as wages, he's not earning $100,000 for his one hour of work. Now, if he's showing up to the
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.920]   office 20 hours a week and he's doing some stuff for you here and there, running some errands,
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.560]   and you're paying him $5,000 a month, no one's going to bark at that, even if it's better than
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.920]   he could make somewhere else. So it all comes down to, all right, what benefits am I getting
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:19.040]   for him versus someone else? Well, the first thing is, if the amount of compensation that
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:24.480]   you're paying him is the same with whether you have a college-aged child working for you or your
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:30.320]   father or your sister or whatever, you can pay him an amount of compensation that's relatively low
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:37.440]   from a tax perspective for him, but yet is significant in terms of its tax deduction for you.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.760]   So let's say you're paying him $30,000 per year. Well, he's not going to be incurring a lot of
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:54.000]   income taxes of $30,000 per year working for you, but you can lower your tax burden by $30,000 of
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.880]   money that otherwise you would gift him. And so in this scenario, it would actually be better for
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:04.800]   him to be working for your business, probably, than for you to be gifting him $30,000 per year.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:11.200]   Let's say that you're making $300,000 per year. So your top $30,000 of income is being taxed at a
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.280]   fairly high bracket. I don't remember the bracket off my head, so let's just say it's being taxed at
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:24.720]   30%. Okay, so that top $30,000 is being taxed at 30%. But if he gets $30,000 of wages, he's probably
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:30.720]   at an effective 10% bracket. So by paying him $30,000 from the business to show up to the office
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.560]   a couple times a week, run some errands for you, do some work from home, et cetera, be available to
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:42.880]   you when you need him, then you are moving $30,000 from a 30% bracket to a 10% bracket in my example.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:47.600]   Same thing you can do with a college student, right? You want your child to go to college,
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.280]   and you want to pay for it, but you'd like to be able to deduct it. Well, how do you deduct your
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:56.320]   child's college tuition? Well, your child works for you, you pay them wages, and then they use
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:01.440]   those wages to go and pay for the college tuition. And so again, you want to make sure that there's
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:06.640]   enough evidence that they're actually working for you. Otherwise, in theory, if you get audited,
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:10.400]   then this can certainly... And they just say, "Well, you're paying them $30,000, and they never
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:13.680]   showed up. They don't have a business phone. They don't do anything." What do they do for you?
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:20.080]   "Well, it's just tax fraud, buddy. We're going to tax you on this at the 30% rate. We're going to
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:25.440]   disallow this $30,000 deduction because they're not genuinely an employee." So it's probably better
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:31.200]   for you to have your dad as an employee versus giving gifts. Now, let's talk about gifts. So
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:35.760]   any person can give another person a gift. The question always just comes down to,
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:42.080]   is it actually a gift or is it not? So you can have your dad as an employee, and you can also
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:47.520]   give him a gift. You would just want to think about how and what is better to structure at it
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:52.480]   and make sure that there's enough... Make sure that you can look yourself in the mirror and say,
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:55.840]   "Yeah, this is actually genuinely structured the way that I want it to be structured,
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:00.000]   and that it's actually honest, so I don't have to worry about an auditor trying to undo something."
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:04.480]   But that's how I would approach it. Did I answer the question or did I muddy the waters?
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:11.760]   No, you answered the question. To be clear, they will be doing real full-time value-added work,
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:18.480]   but since it is in its infancy stages, this business, I wasn't sure if there was a better
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:22.960]   way to do it without incurring a lot of additional costs that I don't need just yet.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:27.680]   Yeah. So if they're actually doing work for you, then you just want to have them do the work for
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:34.080]   you. And it all comes down to how much the profit is, right? If you're thinking about this from a
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:38.400]   tax optimization, which I don't think you should always think about, I think that you should focus
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:43.520]   first on a lifestyle optimization. So having your dad work with you or your mom work with you could
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.200]   just be awesome because it's fun, you're able to work together. Sometimes you can deliver them from
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:56.640]   a really bad situation. They have a job they don't like, well, why don't they come and work with you
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:00.880]   and have a job that they like better, where they just is a better way to work with your parents.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:05.680]   I would much rather see my parents working with me versus working with someone else, as long as I
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:12.160]   could provide something that would be appropriate for them. But if the business is just getting
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:16.960]   started, I don't think you have much of a tax consideration. And then you have to... So
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:25.920]   there can be reasons to do it both ways. Look at your financial plan, your business plan,
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:33.600]   your tax plan. Look at your parents' situation and tax plan. And then it should probably be fairly
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:41.600]   obvious what the best move is. If your dad has a $100,000 a year pension income, and he's coming
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.760]   to work with you and you're building kind of a struggling little company, you don't have any
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:51.840]   taxes, well, then it would be silly for you to start paying him wage income in exchange for his
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.360]   work. He doesn't need any more income. He's in a high bracket because of his $100,000 a year pension.
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:02.320]   He just wants to help you. In which case, I think the better situation is you go ahead and put him
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:08.880]   on a nominal... Maybe he works for free, but you put him on a nominal salary. And then you take
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:13.440]   him on a nice family vacation every year, or you buy a boat and your dad gets to use the boat
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.000]   whenever you want to do it. On the other hand, if you're in the high tax bracket and he's in the low
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:25.040]   tax bracket, now it makes a whole lot more sense to go ahead and pay him wages and whatnot because
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:30.000]   of the tax arbitrage opportunity that I said. So it's the same with any family member. These are
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.640]   tax shifting strategies. Remember the classic tax planning shows I did way back in the beginning
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.800]   where you have shifting strategies, timing strategies, and conversion strategies. So here,
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:43.280]   you're simply trying to engage in a tax shifting strategy, and you're trying to move the tax
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.560]   liability to the lowest cost taxpayer. Very clear. Thank you.
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:57.520]   My pleasure. Anything else? Last one. I have scoured... Well, what I thought was scoured,
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.160]   the annals of radical personal finance for a show on universal life insurance.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:07.440]   And I've come up empty-handed. Is there one that you can point me to that explains why someone
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.080]   might choose that form of life insurance over another? Yeah, let me do it right now. So the
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.640]   answer is no. I started to do some life insurance stuff. Universal life insurance is one where a
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.800]   visual makes all the difference in the world. But I can answer the question for you right now
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:27.600]   in a way that'll make it simpler for you. Why would somebody choose universal life insurance
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:32.640]   instead of... Well, I guess let's go two directions. So first, why would somebody
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:38.320]   choose universal life insurance instead of term life insurance? Well, they would choose universal
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:42.640]   life insurance instead of term life insurance because they wanted the ability to keep the
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:47.520]   life insurance for a longer period of time, and they wanted the ability to have some kind of
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:55.280]   cash value inside of the life insurance policy. But yet they wanted some flexibility. So you can
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.200]   look at it... Let's say you look at a life insurance planning program and you say,
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:06.000]   "I think I'm going to need life insurance for 20 years, but I could buy term insurance,
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.720]   a flat 20-year term policy, or I could buy universal life insurance for 20 years. And
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.280]   I can fund the universal life insurance policy with these higher premiums. And then in 20 years,
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.960]   I'll just cancel the policy. I'll take whatever cash I have, and it'll be lower than the net cost
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:28.000]   of the policy that you had from a term perspective, lower than the premiums of the term
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.560]   perspective." In order for that plan to work, you need to get high enough returns on the universal
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.640]   life insurance policy where it makes sense. And you need to... The opportunity cost of the
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:43.120]   universal life insurance policy needs to be low enough that it makes sense. But you can do that,
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:47.520]   right? You can structure a universal life policy, keep it for 20, 30 years, cash it out,
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:52.720]   and then be on your way. Why would somebody buy a universal life insurance policy instead of a
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.520]   whole life policy? They would buy it for flexibility. Whole life insurance policies
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.880]   are not flexible, generally speaking. But a universal life insurance policy is. You can
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:08.080]   change the premium every year. You can frequently change the death benefit. They're designed to be
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:13.280]   flexible. They're designed to give people options. So with that flexibility comes, in my opinion,
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:19.040]   the major problem with the universal life insurance policy for most people. For most people,
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:23.600]   universal life insurance is the single most complex insurance product that exists.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:29.120]   And this is especially complex when you get into a world of an indexed universal life insurance
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:33.520]   policy. It makes people's eyes glaze over. Non-insurance agents simply don't understand
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:37.920]   how permanent life insurance policies work. They try. They don't get it. They don't understand.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:47.280]   And so it's hard for a lay person, a non-sophisticated person, to fund a universal
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:53.280]   life insurance policy high enough for it to really work out for the long term. And this is where,
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:58.160]   when I used to sell life insurance, I would generally try not to sell universal life
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:04.800]   insurance to an unsophisticated person. Because what happens in the sales scenario is that,
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:11.600]   generally speaking, the person, most people, if you sit down with the average person
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:16.160]   and a good insurance agent, if I sat down and I proved this time and again, I'd have the biggest
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:21.440]   Dave Ramsey fan sitting across from me. And they'd be like, I'm only going to buy term life insurance
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:24.560]   because Dave Ramsey says whole life insurance sucks. I'm only going to buy term life insurance.
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:28.240]   And my deal was always, listen, I think it's fine. I said, but let me just explain to you how it
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:32.320]   works. And I would go through about a 10-minute presentation. I would explain how term life
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:38.800]   insurance works. I would explain how whole life insurance policy works. I never had somebody,
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:44.480]   I guess maybe, I almost never had somebody come and not want to buy whole life insurance at the
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:48.960]   other side of it. Because a good whole life insurance presentation is really compelling
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:53.840]   when you actually understand it. So the vast majority of people want to buy whole life
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:57.840]   insurance when it's compared to term life insurance. Now, I had many people that didn't
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:02.720]   buy it because they shouldn't have, and I told them they shouldn't. But I would also just have
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:05.840]   people, well, I'm just going to buy term life insurance and invest the difference. Fine.
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:09.440]   But when you understand how, when you get a good whole life insurance presentation,
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:13.600]   you understand its options, it's very hard not to want to buy the product.
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.640]   So what's the problem with whole life insurance policies? Well, the premiums are just
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:24.240]   scandalously high. And I would always make them scandalously high, right? Here's a million dollars
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:27.360]   of term life insurance. Here's a million dollars of whole life insurance. A million dollars term
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:32.960]   life insurance, $600 a year. Whole life insurance, $11,000 a year. And so nobody can afford the
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.640]   $11,000 a year. So this is where universal life comes in. And there's a very slippery slope here,
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:44.160]   where for both the agent selling the policy and also the buyer buying the policy,
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:47.680]   they want the whole life, but they can't afford the $11,000 a year.
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:52.880]   So the agent says, well, what we could do is we could get this universal life policy.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:58.640]   We could start it with six, and then down the road, you could go ahead and put 15 once your
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:05.920]   income comes up. Now, can you do it? Absolutely. But what happens is the buyer is thinking about
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:11.200]   all those great benefits of the whole life policy with the $11,000 a year premium. Meanwhile,
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:15.760]   they're paying the $6,000 a year premium for the universal life insurance policy.
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:22.560]   And in the very beginning, the agent shows them, they say, look, this policy will blow up in 47
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:27.040]   years. There's not going to be enough money in it if you only put in $5,000. So you can put in
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:32.880]   five or $6,000 now, but you have to put in more money down the road. And the person says, yeah,
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.280]   yeah, yeah, that is going to be easy. I'm going to be making more money. It's just going to make
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:40.000]   all the sense in the world. And so then what happens? Well, there's a big incentive for the
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.760]   agent to sell the universal life insurance policy instead of the term policy because they make a lot
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:49.440]   more money on commission. $600 a year term policy, maybe the agent makes $450 of commission.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:55.120]   $6,000 a year universal life policy, $4,500 of commission. Feels a lot better to get that
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:03.200]   paycheck. There's also a big incentive for the individual to buy the universal life insurance
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:07.840]   because they're getting the feeling, the dopamine hit of, yeah, I'm saving for my future. I'm going
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:13.200]   to buy this and it's going to be great. But underneath in the policy, as the cost of providing
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:18.000]   the death benefit increases, it eats up the cash values. And then the policy starts to run out of
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.400]   money right when the individual often doesn't have any money. They get in their 70s, they're
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:27.920]   retired, they forgot all about it. When they were 55, they had $182,000 in the policy, but now they
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:33.920]   wake up at 75 and they're getting a bill from the insurance company saying, "You owe us $4,000 this
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:37.840]   year to keep this insurance in force." And now they're just angry across the board. "What do you
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.920]   mean? This was whole life insurance I was going to have." No, it was universal life insurance.
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.480]   And if you still want the coverage, you need to pay a payment of $6,000. So they come in and they
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:51.760]   say, "Why is this policy falling apart? Why is it that my cash value last year was $172,000 and I
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.800]   sent in my $5,000 premium and this year it's down to $164,000?" And then you tell them, "Well, you
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.440]   need to put in $20,000 this year to catch the thing up." And so this is the slippery slope with
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.680]   universal life insurance, why I don't personally recommend it for unsophisticated people.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:13.440]   Now, universal life insurance is the very best tool in a financial planner's arsenal for a
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:20.720]   sophisticated buyer, somebody who understands, somebody who's managing a business deal, and they
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:27.280]   want to put in $3,000 for the next six years, but then they want to put in $33,000 for the following
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:34.320]   20 years. Well, universal life insurance is your ticket. It's really good for a retirement program,
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:39.920]   right? If you're funding kind of a Coley, some kind of retirement benefit. Well, universal life
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.920]   insurance with the flexibility allows you to change the premiums every year based upon the overall
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:53.600]   structure of how much money is available, how much profit is available from the company.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:58.080]   Universal life insurance can be a very useful tool for estate planning because of its flexibility.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:03.360]   Again, "Okay, we're going to start this policy now. We're going to use our crummy limits to
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:09.040]   get money into the trust. We're going to fund the policy with these crummy donations. And then in
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:12.880]   the future, we're going to have these other assets come in." And then we go, "Well, universal life
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:18.960]   insurance is the ticket." So it's an incredible, flexible approach to life insurance, but it only
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.120]   works for somebody who is sophisticated enough to understand how to arrange the premiums.
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:31.280]   And so in general, I caution against it. If somebody walks in and says, "Should I buy a
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:40.080]   $500,000 universal life insurance policy or something else?" I would say, "Buy $400,000
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:45.200]   of term insurance and buy a $100,000 whole life policy," because then the whole life policy works
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:49.360]   as intended. It doesn't fall apart. It doesn't blow up. You always have the money there. You pay
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:56.000]   your flat premium until the premiums go away. It just works. It's 150 years old. It works every
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.040]   single time, whereas the universal life insurance policy only works if you get your predictions
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:04.400]   right, if you get your growth rate right, if you get your premiums right, and if the person
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.200]   understands. And very rarely do you find someone who's actually willing to come along and put a
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:17.200]   lot more money in in the future. The hell, or did I lose you?
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:24.000]   Impressively succinct. It's probably the best description of pros and cons I've heard.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:32.240]   Good. It didn't feel succinct, but I did my best. It's, yeah, I hope it helped.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:36.080]   What you're not seeing is my three hours and three hours plus of research into the topic.
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:36.400]   All right, good.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.680]   I'm coming up with those results.
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:37.920]   Good, good.
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:38.800]   Thank you for that.
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.600]   Yeah, my pleasure. It's one of those things that for the right, this is where, I mean,
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:49.040]   just talk to your insurance agent, right? Insurance planning is usually fairly obvious,
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.880]   just like all, I mean, really all financial planning is pretty obvious to an expert.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:58.400]   Now, I'm limited in what I can do for you here. I always try. But if you sit down with an insurance
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:05.440]   agent and you say, here's what I'm trying to do, right? I'm trying to use the insurance policy for
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:11.520]   these financial planning purposes. I need the insurance for this period of time. This is the
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:17.120]   money that I have available. This is, here's the situation. Here are my assets. Here's my plan.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:25.280]   Then the right policy is a fairly obvious choice in general. There may be a little tweaking here
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:32.640]   and there, but it's really fairly obvious. And so once you realize that, it should take it out.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:37.040]   And then I would just say is that don't do another three hours of internet research.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.320]   Go talk to an insurance agent. That's what they do. And you're clearly armed enough to
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:48.560]   make a good decision. Talk to a couple if you need to. But this is what, it's just simpler
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:58.640]   if you can find someone who could say, tell me your situation and then, yeah, tell me your
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:04.800]   situation and here's what fits. It'll save you the time to do it. So I'm not opposed to a universal
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:10.480]   life insurance policy, but it's got to have a whole lot of caveats and there's got to be a
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:19.600]   very clear understanding. And I'm personally very skeptical that most people can understand it
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:23.920]   enough to be, so that 20 years from now, where they haven't seen their agent retired 20 years
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.320]   ago, they haven't seen it, where they actually understand, oh, you know what? When I was 73
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:32.640]   years old, that was the time that I was going to go ahead and cash this policy in. And yeah,
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.120]   I don't have much money in it, but that's okay. It's just a refund and my other assets worked out.
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:41.680]   And so this, everything happened like it was supposed to. So that would be my recommendation
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:47.520]   for you. And I tell this to insurance agents, right? And here's things, every now and then I do
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:53.440]   training and talk to like financial advisors. And the comment that I make is simply this.
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:14:00.720]   I used to, when I got into the insurance business, I was excited and motivated to learn how to be a
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:06.480]   good salesman. I had read, I forget the name of the guy who wrote it, but he wrote the book called
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.880]   How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling. And I had read this book when I was in
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:15.360]   my late teens, early twenties, super excited. I'm going to go learn to sell and I'm going to
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.360]   learn to be a salesman. And I read all this stuff on sales and I was like, I'm going to learn how to
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:26.160]   do the closes and I'm going to learn how to do a one call close. I would take sales books and study
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.880]   sales techniques and what, cause I thought it was all about sales. And then I got into the business
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:36.160]   and I realized that it wasn't about that kind of selling. It is still selling, but it's much more
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:41.440]   of a consultative selling. And I realized that the insurance game, the insurance business is very
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:46.800]   simple. It's so simple is that when you're an insurance agent and you're talking to someone,
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:53.920]   you're simply asking yourself one question. You're simply asking yourself, is the sale
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:57.440]   presenting itself to exist? I know it sounds wordy, but that's how I think about it. Like,
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:03.520]   is the sale presenting itself to exist? And so when an insurance agent is out doing an interview
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:07.520]   with a prospective client, they're taking all the facts down. They're simply thinking like,
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:11.520]   where's the sale? Is it here or is it not? And sometimes it's there and sometimes it's not.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:18.320]   And so the first question is, is the sale presenting itself to exist or is it not? And
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:23.920]   if it's not, then they move on their way. I try to give some advice. I used to carry around Dave
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:27.920]   Ramsey books in my trunk. It's like, okay, I'm here with you. You're deeply in debt. You don't
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:31.920]   have any money. I can't help you, but here, take a free book and read this and do this and then come
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:35.760]   back in a couple of years and I can help you. Right. But there's nothing I can do. Then if the
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:44.960]   sale reveals itself to exist, then you're simply asking yourself the question, what is the sale?
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:50.240]   What is it that's going to fit this person's need? Is this a disability insurance sale?
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.280]   Is this a life insurance sale? If it's a life insurance sale, is it a term life insurance sale?
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.440]   Is it a whole life insurance sale? Is it a universal life insurance sale? Is it a second
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:06.240]   to die estate planning deal? Is it a buy-sell agreement deal? Is it a policy on my kid?
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:13.600]   What's presenting itself? And it's rather obvious to an insurance agent with a little bit of
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:19.760]   experience, what's there and what's not there. And so, it's funny, people still talk about the
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:24.080]   high pressure insurance stuff. Maybe it does still exist, but I think that's much more of
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:31.200]   an artifact of like the 1970s and the 60s that has somehow flowed over into 2021. I don't think
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:34.640]   it really exists anymore. And so, if you sit down with an insurance agent and you just say,
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.720]   here's what I'm trying to accomplish, can I do it? They'll tell you if you can do it and they'll tell
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:43.360]   you what the best way to do it is. Don't do any more internet research, talk to a couple insurance
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.000]   agents, this is what they get paid for. Great. Thank you, Joshua.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:56.800]   My pleasure. And with that, we wrap up our final call of the day. As we go, I guess I would just
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:03.040]   say that this is one of those things that does that I think you can do. I was just talking with
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:07.520]   someone earlier about kind of a sense of sometimes I get the sense of frustration working with
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:12.160]   professionals, right? I'm suspicious of a lot of professionals. But the older I get, the more I
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:17.760]   learn to be less suspicious of people and just to talk to them and ask for their opinion and get an
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:24.640]   expert's advice. And so, I think being armed with information and expertise is good, right? Doing
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:30.640]   internet research, reading books, these things are all good. I'm glad you're here listening to me.
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.920]   But at the end of the day, the older I get, the more I just want an answer and I want to pay
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:40.720]   someone for their answer and just simply get advice that goes straight to the point. And I think
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:47.600]   that's what professionals in many industries give you is they can summarize their years of learning
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:53.280]   and give you an answer that's clear and that's direct and that makes sense. And so, if you're
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:57.200]   the kind of person who's scared of financial professionals, financial advisors, financial
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:02.000]   insurance agents, et cetera, you're scared to be sold. I understand that. I used to feel that way
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.240]   before I got in the business. But then once I got into the business, I found that there were a lot
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.960]   fewer sharks in the water than I ever thought. Now, are there sharks in the water? I think there
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:16.000]   are. I think there really are, especially when you're money. Money is like blood in the water
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:22.800]   to a shark. I guess that was a myth. The MythBusters busted that one. But money does attract
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:31.120]   swindlers. It always has. But in today's world, I think that if you go out and you talk to a couple
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:35.440]   of financial professionals and you just tell them your problems and what you're working on,
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:39.680]   they'll probably be able to point you in a better direction than hours and hours of internet
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:45.600]   research. And I could and probably will make this into a whole show, but I'm in a lot of financial
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.680]   groups, a lot of retirement groups, money groups and whatnot on Facebook. And I often see people
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:55.440]   ask these questions and I think, why are you posting the question here in a Facebook group?
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:00.560]   Now, on the one hand, I love the opportunities that we have to get people's feedback. And you
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:08.240]   can get some good advice. The problem is this. Most people don't have the ability to discern
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:14.160]   good advice. And most people in the Facebook group are simply reflecting the general culture
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:20.800]   of that group. This is the buy term, invest the difference group. This is the whole life insurance
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:25.760]   group. This is the bank on yourself group. Well, you can take the same question and you can go and
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:32.320]   you can post it in the personal finance group and in the bank on yourself group and you get two
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:39.200]   opposite answers, just absolutely obvious opposite answers. It's not because everyone's well-meaning,
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.080]   it's just people coming at it from a very different perspective. And so what you need
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:46.800]   often is personalized advice. I don't know how you can get that other than from a professional,
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:51.280]   to find a professional, someone who's knowledgeable and who give you personalized advice.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:57.280]   Sometimes that professional can be someone you know who's well-read, great. But even there,
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:02.960]   I think there's often a lot of biases that are just simply unknown. And I really think more and
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:07.200]   more, there is a lot of value in professional advice. It's hard to tell you how to find it.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:10.800]   I'll do my best to point you in the right direction. Like you just heard, I did my best to
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:17.520]   give you an answer and say, heck, here's the pitfalls, here's what can happen. But at the end
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:21.920]   of the day, don't waste too much time on research. Do the amount of research that you need to do to
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:27.520]   get comfortable and then talk to the professional so that you can potentially save yourself some
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:34.080]   time because the ultimate limited resource that we all have is time. And with that, I will close
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:38.080]   it out at two hours and 20 minutes. I hope that this last two hours and 20 minutes has been a good
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:42.800]   use of your time. I thank you for listening. Have a great weekend and I will be back with you very
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:49.840]   soon.
