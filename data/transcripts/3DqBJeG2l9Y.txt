[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   I've been in this space for more than 20 years and I look at the stuff and I'm blown away.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.560]   And you had asked me a year ago, "Will we have made this progress?"
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.360]   And I would have guessed it. I thought that this task was higher.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   But the thing that happened is that the more you get closer to human-level intelligence,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.480]   the more you realize that the task is much harder.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.760]   And so some people are like, "Oh my god, we're going to lose our job as developers or as creators.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.880]   No way that's going to happen."
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.560]   I mean, we're still millions away because as soon as you make some progress, you realize that,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.480]   and it's something people have said, but it is that the goalpost actually looks further.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.840]   Because you realize that actual intelligence is a much wider space.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.800]   It's much more complicated.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.080]   So you realize that the system still makes very, very silly mistakes that humans wouldn't make.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.120]   But it does things that you didn't think would be possible.
