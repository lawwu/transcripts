[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   to have some people that are like completely caught up
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.760]   at internet culture, writing about internet culture
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.340]   as internet culture strangles and drowns them.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.620]   It's like actually like a kind of interesting
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.220]   from a performance art way of actually capturing the reality
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.800]   of this crazy whirlwind that is internet culture.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.560]   I'm Cal Newport here with Jamie Kilstein
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.840]   for Cal and Jamie Explain the Internet.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.400]   If you're new, the premise here is simple.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.960]   I don't use social media.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.120]   So I have no idea what's happening online.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.440]   Jamie is weaning off of social media.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.460]   He too has no idea about what's happening online
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.880]   which makes us the two worst people in the world
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.200]   to try to explain up to the moment internet trends.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.800]   So that of course is exactly what we're gonna do
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.640]   on this show.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.620]   We have five trends from the last week of internet culture
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.440]   that Jamie and I will struggle to understand
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.080]   and explain to you, our long suffering audience.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.360]   Jamie, this is our second episode.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.280]   So we're one episode in.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.220]   How do you think we're doing with this experiment so far?
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.320]   As people or as podcast hosts?
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.120]   Because as podcast hosts, I think we're killing it.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.120]   As people, I had to glance at Twitter a couple times
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.440]   to kind of see what was going on.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.320]   So I feel like while you don't know at all what's going on,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.480]   this show also brings about a certain type of PTSD
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.800]   for me who used to be engulfed in that culture.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.240]   I thought we were short a story this morning.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.380]   So I just went to see, I logged on to see
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.140]   what people were talking about
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.900]   and Fire James Gunn was trending.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.100]   And I kid you not, I had to scroll through
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.780]   a hundred angry comic book fans
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.420]   to even figure out what was happening,
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.380]   what was even happening.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.980]   And I still kind of don't know.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.380]   I think the Superman thing got fired
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.180]   and then James Gunn made a pedo joke like a decade ago.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.380]   I have no idea.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.140]   All I know is like, I like Groot.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.980]   And that's as far as my, that's where my alliance is,
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.300]   which with Groot.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.500]   - So you're basically saying the first sponsors
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.140]   of this video series needs to be our personal therapist
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.980]   and Groot.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.800]   - Yeah.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.220]   - Basically sponsored by our therapist
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.660]   who we're gonna have to see a lot more
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.500]   after doing this show.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.700]   And then also Groot.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.200]   Actually, ironically and coincidentally,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.260]   my therapist looks a lot like Groot.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.600]   So I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.320]   - I basically talked to a tree.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.280]   This is what I'm trying to say.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600]   Cal has been drugged is what's happening.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.560]   Is he was drugged by a family member.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.720]   He goes out into nature, talks to a tree.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.400]   He comes back and he goes, "I don't know, I feel better."
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.560]   And then his wife goes, "Great."
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.480]   And then that's it.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.840]   - His name is Solomon.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.480]   I've carved a face into it.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.200]   We have a good relationship.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Good relationship.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   - This show, look, not to hype us up,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.600]   but if you are new to the show, here's why it's great.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.140]   You get to hear about the garbage
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.640]   that is happening on Twitter,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   that people are consuming their lives with.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.920]   And then you get to go outside and hear birds chirping
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.280]   and realize the world's actually an okay place.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.600]   And I'm not saying this show
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.480]   is to make you feel better than them.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.920]   I would love to say the show
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.440]   is about bringing people together,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.740]   waging a war on tribalism.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.720]   But also it's like kind of reminding me
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.760]   what I used to do and why I'm off it
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.120]   and reminding you guys why it's probably better
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240]   to read books and stay off Twitter.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   But if you're at a Christmas party this week
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.640]   and someone's like, "Man, James Gunn, right?"
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.880]   You can at least be like, "You stupid idiot,"
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.440]   and know what they're talking about.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.040]   - Exactly.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.160]   It's the way I describe it on my podcast.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.360]   The episode is coming out around the same time as this one.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   I was explaining it to my listeners this show.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.680]   And the way I said it is,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.120]   I think there might be some benefit as well
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.880]   in othering internet culture.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   So when you hear two idiots
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.300]   that don't know anything about it trying to figure it out,
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.800]   it does kind of emphasize the absurdity of it all.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.240]   So if you're really stuck in the middle of that world,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.560]   maybe hearing me have no idea who,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   actually I know who James Gunn is,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.600]   but I don't really know what you're talking about,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.920]   just emphasizes a little bit,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.120]   this is not the center of world culture right now.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.920]   It's its own weird thing that feels like everything
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.180]   when you're on the phone,
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.520]   but you step away for about nine minutes,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.760]   you spend some time talking to your tree therapist
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.520]   and you're like, "Wait, there's more to life than this."
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.480]   At least that's, so we're hyping ourselves up so much now,
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   Jamie, like we're awesome.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.160]   - No, no, no, this is good.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.980]   This is good.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.040]   This is what my tree therapist told me to do.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.160]   Where isn't it, wouldn't you rather go to see
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.000]   the new Superman movie and just be like, "That was fun.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.420]   "I like Superman, he comes from Krypton."
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.160]   Instead of being the guy in your pack of friends
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.200]   that's like, "You know, when they were making this,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.680]   "James Gunn really said some problematic things
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.880]   "and I liked it better."
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.360]   You will never be invited to a movie again.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   Guys, two people I know died this week.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.720]   Two people I know died.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.800]   The idea of living a life where you are engulfed
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   in Twitter drama or just cursing about Glenn Greenwald,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.760]   like live a life where you don't know
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.080]   who Glenn Greenwald is.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.120]   Isn't that a better life?
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.320]   Again, no offense to Glenn,
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.960]   but isn't that a better life?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.720]   Just go out and do real things with real people
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.360]   and you realize that so much of this shit doesn't matter.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.480]   With that said, me and Cal are about to dedicate
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.160]   an entire episode of a podcast
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.560]   to the shit we're making fun of
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.880]   'cause we're hypocrites and it's fun.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.160]   - This is probably the wrong time
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.240]   to introduce our guest host, Glenn Greenwald.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.080]   Come on in. - Glenn Greenwald.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.520]   - Via satellite from Brazil
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.120]   with all of the dogs he's adopted.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.760]   - We're gonna have to start with explaining Glenn Greenwald,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.480]   but let's get into it.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.120]   We have, tell the audience, you can confirm,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120]   you and I have not pre-discussed
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.280]   any of these five trending internet topics
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.520]   that we're about to go through.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.480]   - No, the show's also affecting our friendship.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.400]   We can't talk to each other.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.240]   Correct.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.080]   - Yes, I ignore you.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.960]   Okay, here we go.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.040]   I am going to click my magic button here.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.720]   Item number one, it's a tweet.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   - Okay.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.040]   - For those who are listening,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.600]   it says, "This is ridiculous.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.000]   "Shame on FIFA for allowing him to touch, kiss,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.080]   "and hold the World Cup.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.040]   "Salt Bae, B-A-E, drops salt on meat.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.000]   "What is he doing here?"
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.440]   This is tweeted from someone named Terry Fleurs.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.240]   Jamie, I have no idea what's going on here.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.280]   What do we even? - Not a clue.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.120]   - Okay. - Don't know.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.400]   - But this is trending.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.160]   It was trending a couple days ago.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.480]   This was one of many.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.960]   I mean, the outrage, there were,
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.080]   I don't know who this guy is.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.880]   I sort of, this is where our age is gonna show,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.160]   I sort of know what Bae means.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.640]   I believe Bae, and you know,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.840]   our 16-year-old girl demographic,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.280]   which is huge and mighty,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.240]   they're gonna be very mad that I don't have this right.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.600]   I remember Bae first coming out.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.080]   I believe he was called Prison Bae,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.040]   where there was a picture of this dude in jail.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   I don't know what he was in jail for,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.840]   but he was, Cal, look at me, stunning.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   Like, he had these insane, like, turquoise eyes,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.280]   and so they were like Prison Bae.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.360]   So I think Bae is what you would call your partner,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.440]   kind of like Boo or Babe or whatever.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   So some point, people must have liked this guy.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.240]   I've put together he has some kind of maybe
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.880]   cooking show or whatever.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.920]   Hence, he originally got the name Salt Bae.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.880]   But now, dude, people were so outraged.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.720]   There were soccer players who refused
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.360]   to take pictures with him.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.120]   He was going around, like, taking selfies
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.840]   with every player, and every player kind of looked annoyed.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.000]   But I don't know how he got there.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   I don't know how he got famous.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.400]   I don't know who he is.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.960]   I do know what the World Cup is, and that's it.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.560]   - So here is, I've done a search for the name.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.640]   As I'm showing on the screen now,
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.360]   a Google search for Salt Bae.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.000]   This Washington Post article, I think,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.480]   maybe wins the award for, like,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.720]   all internet stuff put together.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.560]   It says, "From Jared Kushner to Salt Bae,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.280]   "here's who Elon Musk was seen with at the World Cup."
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.440]   So that wins the award.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.280]   But here's the thing.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.400]   Let's not figure out who this person is
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.520]   because there's the broader point here,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.160]   which is the World Cup was fun, right?
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.560]   I mean, it was like this final game,
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.240]   and it was a tie, and they went to penalty kicks,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.920]   and there's this Argentinian guy
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.640]   who's having some redemption story
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.120]   of leading up or living up to his promise
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.040]   as this super athlete.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.400]   You look at Twitter, you look at this.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.280]   This seems like this impulse of,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.160]   "I gotta have a negative take.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.480]   "If I don't have a negative take,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.800]   "no one was gonna pay attention to me,
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.040]   "no one's gonna think I'm smart."
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.920]   Why would you focus on this?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.120]   Some guy touching the cup,
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.520]   when you could say, "I just am happy this was fun.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.100]   "I watched it on Saturday.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.320]   "I had a good day."
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.200]   - I am in the trending topics right now.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.640]   This has 11,000 likes.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.920]   Salt Bae can kiss my ass, wanting all that attention,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.080]   and touching the cup.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.680]   Who the fuck are you, bro?
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.440]   Your two minutes of fame of up next.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.760]   Now, that is nothing compared to @billcorbett.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.600]   Someone please give me
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.920]   Salt Bae's current assassination coordinates.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.120]   Okay, so I believe me and Bill follow each other on Twitter.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.920]   So mad.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.740]   Now, it's like,
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.360]   I love your point, dude,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.900]   because I feel like even
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.920]   new trying to be off social media less,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.120]   definitely trying not to be,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.480]   or not being negative on social media, Jamie,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.120]   looked at that and still was kind of like,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.000]   "Oh, I wonder who this asshole is."
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.680]   Like, dude, I'm not part of outrage culture anymore,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.100]   and my brain still goes there.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.880]   And I'm also a really positive person.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.900]   I'm always a look on the bright side, whatever,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.280]   and I am still so much getting over
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.060]   what social media does to your brain
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.720]   that the idea of,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.060]   what you just said is advice I would give to anyone else
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.540]   on any other topic that is not on social media.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.800]   - Right. - And I didn't even
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.640]   think about that.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.460]   - I mean, this is-- - Like, how,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.960]   why does anyone even know
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.400]   that he was on the fucking field?
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.240]   - That's what I'm saying.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.720]   That tweet thread or topic
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.680]   is like the Lionel Messi of outrage culture.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.040]   It's like the,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.280]   like a peak,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.360]   this is an incredibly skilled application
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.540]   of professional outrage,
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.520]   to be able to find an angle.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.380]   Like, I can find an angle
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.080]   in this kind of feel good, fun thing.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.320]   I can find an angle to be upset with.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.560]   Yeah, it's a little esoteric,
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.240]   but I can get whatever, 10,000 likes.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.400]   I mean, look, it's possible
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.700]   that like in the day leading up to the World Cup finals,
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.880]   this guy, Salt Bae, had said,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.560]   look, to his local community,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   I am gonna pay to gather
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.600]   for all of the children in the town.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   I'm gonna pay for a bus.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.080]   We're gonna take them to the stadium.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.680]   We're gonna give them a World Cup experience.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   And everyone was happy,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.880]   and they gathered the children in a bus,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.460]   and they're like, thank you, Salt Bae.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.340]   Thank you, Padre Bae.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.220]   - Slowly locking the door to the bus.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.260]   - Yeah, slowly locking the door to the bus.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.060]   They're driving towards Qatar.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.040]   You know, they take the turn into the sea,
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.940]   drowning all the children.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.300]   Okay, if that had happened,
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.820]   he shouldn't be touching the World Cup.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.740]   - Let's say Salt Bae takes all the kids.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.940]   He goes, hey, we're gonna meet Messi.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.780]   Aren't you excited?
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.980]   And they're like, hooray, hooray.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.300]   Finally, something good in my life.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.220]   - Bless you, bless you, Father Bae.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.060]   Bless you.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.820]   - Bless Father Bae, Father Bae.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.360]   And then again, leaves the bus once again,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.100]   slowly locks the door,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.820]   calls over the government for Qatar,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.940]   and goes, I found a bunch of gay kids.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.260]   Go do what you do.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.900]   Go Qatar 'em.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.500]   And then he runs onto the field
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.780]   with his little autograph book,
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.380]   and he's like, it's me, Salt Bae.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.220]   - And grabs the cop.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.060]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.100]   Then I would be upset.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.540]   I would be upset.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.580]   - What if Salt Bae,
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.220]   you know, he is a person of color,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.500]   but what if he took that cop,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   and, you know, he drew,
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.060]   he just wrote white power on it.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.900]   Not good.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.720]   - I would get it.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.560]   I would get it, yeah.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.400]   (laughing)
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.460]   - Let's make that man trend on Twitter.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.180]   Let's make the man who just homophobically
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.620]   had a bus full of children killed
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.580]   who just wanted to meet a soccer player.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.660]   - Before, in an unrelated incident,
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.200]   writing white power on the World Cup.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.460]   Okay, I get it.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.300]   This is someone we should be upset about.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.580]   - That should be a trending story.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.200]   - That is appropriate outrage.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.740]   All right, story number two.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.060]   Let's see what we got here.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.380]   Chrome tabs.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.780]   Ooh, this is completely blind.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.740]   All it says on my screen share here is Twitter.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.100]   Tweet/Twitter.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.540]   - Oh yeah, all of mine, 'cause again,
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.700]   I don't have TikTok.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.280]   - All right, here we go.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.380]   For those who are listening,
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.340]   this is from Franklin Graham,
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.500]   blue check verified.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.340]   Here we go.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.380]   Franklin Graham is the president of Samaritan's Purse.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.220]   Okay.
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.780]   Amy Grant announced that she and her husband,
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.620]   Vince Gill, are going to host a same-sex wedding
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.380]   on their farm for her niece.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.340]   Amy is quoted as saying,
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.500]   "Jesus, you just narrowed it down to two things,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.380]   "love God and each other."
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.940]   All right, this is another trending tweet.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.780]   Is that right, Jamie?
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.620]   This was getting a lot of attention this week on Twitter.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.240]   - At least, here's the problem.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.380]   If I go to check trending things
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.300]   because of the algorithm,
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.060]   it's only pro wrestling and fighting,
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.260]   mixed martial arts.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   So I just have to go to what is overall trending.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.260]   And this was indeed trending a couple of days ago.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.140]   - And Vince Gill, is that the Breaking Bad?
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.980]   Am I thinking of the right person,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.780]   the creator of the show, Breaking Bad?
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.620]   - Definitely not.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.960]   That is Vince Gill again.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.620]   Vince Gill, I believe, judging by his name,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.300]   I think he's a country music star.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.340]   - That makes more sense, I suppose.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.900]   - Amy Grant, you may remember,
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.300]   because I assume, as my mom did,
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.180]   you took many car rides to your elementary school
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.060]   with her blaring Amy Grant.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.100]   My mom was very big into Amy Grant,
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.140]   very big into Celine Dion.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.500]   Those were her jams.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.820]   - All right, so let's look at some responses here.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.020]   This will help clarify what's going on.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.680]   - So the responses, I think,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.920]   I didn't read the rest of Franklin's thing,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.180]   but I'm looking at responses.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.620]   And the story itself is just a story.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.200]   And I think it's a good story.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.100]   - Oh, this is about Franklin.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.060]   Franklin is just the son of Billy Graham.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.140]   So this is an evangelical.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.260]   - Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.100]   - That was-
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.220]   - So that makes this even more interesting.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.340]   - Because look at his, it's a thread.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.340]   He posts a story,
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.940]   but then the next thing Franklin Graham says is,
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.380]   yes, we are to love God and love each other,
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.460]   but if we love God, we will seek to obey his word.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.360]   Jesus told us, if you love me, keep my commandments,
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.460]   John 14, 15.
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.940]   God defines what is sin, not us.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.780]   And his word is clear that homosexuality is a sin.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.900]   Also, what the hell is Salt Bae doing at your wedding?
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.220]   That's his follow-up.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.780]   That's his follow-up tweet right there.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.620]   - Okay, so this is like-
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.180]   - Hey kids, you want to go to a wedding?
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.340]   - It'll be fun.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.140]   There's definitely not boxes full of poisonous vipers
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.940]   that I will release in the bus once the doors are locked.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.540]   (laughing)
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.900]   So this is like old school.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.740]   This is what's his tweet.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.320]   Okay, so this is like old school,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.900]   like anti-gay marriage, homophobia stuff.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.740]   - Back in the 90s, baby.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.980]   - It's like retro.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.780]   I see, so there's sort of a,
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.220]   it's like a retro,
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.060]   what's the word?
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.060]   Like a retro hate type thing.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.060]   So there's sort of like a nostalgia to this going around.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.700]   Like this guy looks old.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.420]   I'm looking at a picture of Franklin Graham here.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.020]   - We all remember Amy Grant, the baby, baby, like, yep.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.660]   And then, yeah, we all remember Billy Graham.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.740]   And here's the thing.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.760]   Many people might not know this.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.420]   And in fact, this is going to sound sarcastic.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:36.420]   I'm Christian and I love that Amy Grant's doing this.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.100]   And I think that like, look, man,
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.500]   there's a lot of things in the Bible that are sins.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.580]   You know what the biggest one is?
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.340]   Pride.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.940]   Like we do this shit every day.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.060]   The whole point of, you know,
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.660]   Jesus dying for our sins and whatever is being like,
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.900]   hey, we all fuck up every day.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.460]   We're all sinners every day.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.660]   How many of you waited until marriage to have sex?
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.900]   I know I didn't.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.260]   Got me in a lot of trouble.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.000]   We all do it every day.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And the point is we are trying to be a good person.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.700]   The point is we are trying to be better people every day.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.540]   That's it.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.540]   And if you are, you know, this story,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.340]   and I'm gonna dunk on the left as well,
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.020]   is you'd also have people on the left who I'm seeing,
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.940]   they would repost this story and they'd be like,
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.700]   fuck you, you Christians.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.540]   Screw you, look what Amy Grant's doing.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.900]   Look at all these little bitch ass Christians
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.900]   like getting mad.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.900]   And it's like, hey man, Amy Grant's a bitch ass Christian
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.820]   and she's being awesome.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.600]   If you're mad that a couple is getting married,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.140]   you should reevaluate things.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.740]   And also if your first instinct isn't to be like,
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.540]   oh my God, how awesome that this gay Christian couple
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.160]   isn't gonna feel alone or not gonna feel like they belong.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.600]   And like you have this like person with a good voice
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.360]   and platform officiating her family members,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.320]   by the way, family members wedding,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.740]   like that's a beautiful thing.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.420]   If on either side, your first instinct is like
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.940]   trash someone, I think that's rough.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.860]   - That's Twitter, that's Twitter.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.700]   What's the angle?
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.520]   What's the angle?
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.380]   Either we can use this to push it in someone's face
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.340]   or attack.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.700]   I mean, but let me say, here's the, you know,
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.700]   there's progress in society.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   I think it's progress that you and I look at
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.580]   just the description of this story
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.660]   and we can't figure out why the hell this is trending.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.800]   I think that's a good sign.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.300]   I mean, I'm thinking like, so is this farm haunted?
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.940]   Like where is this going?
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.000]   Is this like a murder farm?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.940]   Like did it actually took some digging to be like,
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.940]   oh, it's Franklin Graham.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.060]   And it's a kind of like a retro like Christian thing.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.980]   That's, you know, the fact that that wasn't obvious
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.940]   that this would be, yeah.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.900]   I'm trying to find some positive.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.960]   - I haven't heard an Amy Grant song in a while.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.660]   If it was Amy Grant came back from the dead
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.180]   to officiate a wedding at her haunted farm.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.020]   - Let's trim that.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.300]   - Let's trim that.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.180]   - Zombie Amy Grant.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.020]   - Yeah.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.840]   (laughing)
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.820]   - Host wedding at haunted farm.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.840]   - Attempts to perform ceremony
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.360]   with zombie limbs falling to ground
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.640]   and being sucked in by other zombies.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   Yeah, man.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.320]   - Amen.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.140]   - It's a trending story.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.500]   And Hey, I want to talk, you know,
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.180]   this story actually came up on my podcast,
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.380]   Advice Not Taken.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.220]   And I used it as an opportunity to promote this
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.140]   because, you know, I have been talking about
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.860]   religion, but in a sort of like feed the poor,
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.100]   help people kind of way.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.780]   And when this came up, I was sort of reminded
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.620]   that a lot of people will use religion to discriminate
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.860]   or whatever, which is a real bummer.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.980]   And, you know, I think to me,
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.500]   to me, one of the things I said is, look, man,
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.460]   if you're a kid raised in a household and you're gay
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.220]   and you're being told that you're going to hell,
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.380]   you're being told that you're broken,
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.900]   you're being told that you can't be a Christian,
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.660]   worst case scenario, this kid is going to act out,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.100]   self-harm, drink drugs, sleep with people
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.780]   you don't want them sleeping with, blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.020]   But best case, if you really care about Jesus
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.260]   and religion and God,
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.300]   they're certainly going to turn away from that.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.140]   You know, I mean, I'm not gay.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.940]   And despite what many of you have told me on the internet
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.980]   and I'm, Twitter's so bad.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.020]   - Sorry, next story.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.860]   Okay, go on.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.900]   (laughing)
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.900]   - Is co-host of Cal and JB explain the internet gay.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:37.980]   And the reason I turned away from God was religion.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.540]   I just saw shit like this and I'm like,
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.820]   oh, is this the priority?
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.100]   I don't want to be a part of that.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.860]   When your religion is so bad, it makes people be like,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.020]   I don't want to get to know God,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.980]   the maybe creator of the universe.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.700]   It's like, you're fucking up, man.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.100]   You should be prioritizing, whether it's on social media,
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.300]   whether it's religion, whether it's in your community,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.260]   how do you prioritize lifting people up
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.780]   instead of just cutting people down?
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.460]   Which is what social media is.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.300]   - Which is, I think a very good point,
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   very fair critique of Franklin Graham.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.740]   If he's the son of the most famous Christian evangelist
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.180]   of the 20th century, he's an evangelical Christian.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.180]   So that is a Christian with an imperative to save souls.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.260]   - Yes.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.020]   - How is there any sort of evangelism in that tweet?
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.700]   Like that is entirely just dunking for the benefit
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.940]   of your existing audience.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.460]   That's like, clap for me, I want more followers from people.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.340]   I mean, what about that tweet would ever make you think
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.620]   this is definitely going to bring more people in?
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.020]   So I think your point's very well taken,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.060]   that if you grow up and think religion
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.660]   is the key to salvation in life,
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.500]   you would say, what I really don't want to do
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.180]   is find a way to ensure my kid will not be religious.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.460]   To pick out one thing and harp on it in such a way
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.100]   that I've definitely driven that kid away from religion.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.660]   I'm not an expert on Jesus,
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.100]   but it doesn't seem very Jesus-like.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.940]   - Geez.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.780]   - All right.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.620]   - People, if you're watching the video,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.820]   my computer is about to die and I'm just scrambling
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.220]   to plug it in really quick.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.540]   - Next article here.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.860]   Co-host of "Cal and Jamie Explains the Internet,"
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:15.900]   computer almost dies, worse than Salt Bay.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.580]   - Gay co-host.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.660]   - Gay co-host of "Cal and Jamie Explains the Internet"
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.560]   has never seen a computer before.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.120]   (laughing)
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.360]   - Well, what's funny is to shout out to producer Jesse.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.160]   Cal and I actually worked very hard
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.800]   to make it look better this time.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.320]   Every show, by the way, you guys are just the hipsters
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.120]   who are gonna remember when this show is huge.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.040]   We really did work hard to fix it,
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.560]   and now I've completely screwed it up.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   - I think it looks good.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.240]   Actually, this one looks good.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.120]   I think we got a good position here.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.960]   All right, well, in the meantime,
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.040]   I'm gonna load up the next story.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.680]   This one I'm gonna hope, I'm just gonna,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.600]   I'm gonna assume this next story is gonna be more uplifting
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.960]   and make us feel, this for sure will make us feel better
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.400]   about ourselves and the internet.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.480]   Here we go.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.400]   - Let's do it.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.800]   - All right, Megan McCain.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.480]   On the first night of Hanukkah,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.560]   the anti-Israel New York Times issues a crossword puzzle
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.800]   that looks like a swastika.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.640]   - There we go.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.760]   Wait, keep reading the tweet
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.160]   because you have the Twitter sass coming.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.040]   - Oh, yeah, can't make this shit up.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.200]   We see you, New York Times.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.480]   We see you.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.520]   Yeah, very, very haunted.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.360]   We see you, New York Times.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.200]   We see you.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.600]   It sounds like something you would hear
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.520]   at Amy Grant's haunted farm.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.240]   - Yeah, we see you, devourer of souls.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.480]   We see you as you emerge from the haunted halo.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.440]   What, okay, first of all, sound of loud sighing.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.600]   I think we all just kind of agree with that.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.680]   Is the idea here that the New York Times,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.520]   there's people at the New York Times,
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.360]   they got together, like in a conference room.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.200]   - Yes.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.640]   - Okay, we all agree.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.880]   We all agree that we hate Israel.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.800]   Okay.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.680]   What we need to do is get the vague shape
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.080]   of a swastika in the paper.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.840]   - Ooh, and can I chime in here?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.680]   - Sure.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.000]   - What would be the most hilarious day to do it on?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.520]   - Yeah, and we need to wait till--
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.160]   - Isn't one of their weird holidays coming up?
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.920]   - And we also, one of their weird holidays coming up.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.960]   So we're gonna put a swastika in the paper
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   in the hopes of encouraging Nazis.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.920]   I mean, what's the, let's just like,
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.600]   let's pull this thread.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.000]   - You know what, fellas, we've talked about it a long time.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.120]   The Washington Post, they're still really well-known
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.600]   for Woodward and Bernstein breaking a lot of stories
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.280]   and people are still kind of upset with us
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.120]   for the weapons of mass destruction thing.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.640]   How do we make ourself relevant again?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.440]   Nazism?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.160]   - We're gonna be pro-Nazi.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.400]   - I mean, look, I am looking at this thing.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.120]   You know, I see the, what would you call it?
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.440]   The arms.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.160]   It has like two out of the three pieces
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.280]   of the swastika arms, but it kind of falls apart
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.480]   when you would have the final piece.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.120]   I'm giving this a lot of attention, Meghan McCain,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.640]   and I see you have, it's swastika-esque,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.480]   but I think it's missing the key component.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   - How as a, look, as an art contesseur,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.880]   is saying he doesn't see it.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.040]   Also, I feel like this is a bit of a Rorschach test
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.320]   kind of situation, which is like,
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.920]   if you see a swastika there,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.760]   why are you thinking about swastikas so much?
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.680]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.040]   Like, who, I would have never been like,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.760]   there it is, there's my boy, there's a swastika.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.920]   Like, I'm just, I'm not looking for that.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.760]   And also, look, even if the New York Times
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.640]   was indeed anti-Semitic or whatever,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.480]   which, pick a choice, guys.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.360]   Do the Jews run the media or are they anti-Semitic?
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.960]   Which one is it?
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.880]   - And also, it's Will Shorts.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.680]   It's not even like the New York Times writ large.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.360]   It's like the nicest man in the world.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.960]   Have you seen Will Shorts?
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.320]   I have watched a documentary.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.440]   I have watched a documentary on Will Shorts
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.760]   and how they make these crossword puzzles.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   I know a lot about Will Shorts.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   He looks like Calvin's father from "Calvin and Hops."
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.280]   He has a mustache.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.520]   He's like a short, cappy-looking Midwestern guy
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.360]   who does his entire life-
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.920]   - All of his answers to questions
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.480]   are about building character.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.720]   - Yeah, and I guess he is the last person
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   I guess you would assume is like,
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.280]   he's decided late in his career
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   to secretly move Nazism into-
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.400]   - And also, like, (laughs)
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.240]   you know how people, when they realize
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.720]   that maybe they've been chasing superficial things
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.920]   for the first half of their life,
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.880]   they really dedicate the second half of their life
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.640]   to doing something altruistic?
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.120]   That's what Will Shorts did with Nazism.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.920]   - Exactly, that's his second act.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.760]   Here, I'm gonna put a photo up.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.600]   - His second mountain.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.840]   Yeah, as David Brooks, also New York Times writer, would say.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.280]   Yeah, man, why?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.120]   - Here we go.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.000]   - Also, if we're just, can we just like be-
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.840]   - That's it.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.680]   (laughs)
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.520]   - That's it.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.440]   - The 2022's face of Nazism.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.840]   - Yeah, he's like a guy with a mustache.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.600]   - Yeah, yeah, well.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.800]   - No one with a mustache has ever been associated
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.200]   with any sort of anti-Semitic behavior, so we're good.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.600]   - Come on, guys, come on, guys, get it together.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.640]   Can I just say one more thing, though?
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.480]   - Yeah, please.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.320]   - If we're just talking pragmatically,
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.480]   also, like, I don't wanna get political,
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.160]   but like APAC, like the biggest Israeli lobby,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.600]   they have bought ads,
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.760]   they have had full-page ads in the New York Times,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.240]   but also, like, pragmatically,
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.640]   even if they were a bunch of people
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.640]   who didn't like fucking Netanyahu
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   or didn't like Israel or whatever,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.160]   there are so many checks that you have to go through,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.640]   you know this, as a writer, right?
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.240]   That if anyone, besides,
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.360]   I don't know if Meghan McCain was the one
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.280]   who started the outrage, but if anyone,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.880]   and I saw a lot of, like, blue-check,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.680]   respectable, respected people talking about,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.600]   if anyone at the New York Times caught this,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.080]   if an intern, if you're about to post anything
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.800]   that resembles a fucking swastika,
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.280]   I feel like someone's gonna flag it
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.400]   and be like, "Hey, guys, let's add a couple more black dots,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.000]   "this is looking very Hitler-esque."
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.920]   - Right, there's a checkbox on the copyedit form.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.760]   - Yeah, dude.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.600]   - Does it look like a swastika?
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.440]   So now I'm looking at the responses,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.560]   so there's a lot of, like, that's disgusting, hateful,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.200]   but look at this right here.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   It's a Hawking cruise, the ancient Hindu symbol.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.840]   So isn't there, yeah, there's an ancient Hindu symbol
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.400]   that the swastika is a perversion of,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.680]   but it's like faces the other way or something like that.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.120]   - And if you were a bored kid,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.560]   you'd try to make, like, a square out of those.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.320]   - I definitely would, that's a great doodle.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.480]   - Yeah.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.320]   - Man, people are just,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.520]   here's what I'm getting from these reactions.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.080]   - Just cancel my subscription.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.920]   (laughs)
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.120]   So that's why you cancel your subscription, guys.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.960]   - I will give you--
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.280]   - No weapons of mass destruction.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.720]   - An over-decade war, countless of soldiers' lives lost,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.080]   and you're canceling your subscription
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.280]   because this kind of looks like, my God.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.520]   - I will give you $10,000 if that gentleman
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.920]   was subscribed and canceled because of this.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   I will give you $10,000.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   Oh my God, this is starting to get, all right.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.440]   Oh, and then we get January 6th references.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.080]   Man, look at this, this is just terrible.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.440]   All right, for people who are listening and not watching,
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.080]   I'm just scrolling through the comments.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.520]   And again, I go back to my same point from last week.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.360]   - That these are people that follow Meghan McCain.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.800]   - Yeah, I mean, okay, if you're Meghan McCain,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.040]   okay, maybe you're like, I wanna build a following.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.800]   There's a commercial or political value to that.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.280]   This type of content attracts followers, right?
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.480]   It might be a little slimy, but you get it.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.840]   I just cannot for the life of me
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.920]   understand why you would be,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.360]   I'm looking at like, this is the 15th responder.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.160]   Like why are you this deadly spell saying,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.880]   I'm ready to believe it wasn't intentional,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.600]   but I'm not prepared to believe it's obvious.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.840]   Then Ethel Faust talking about the rotational symmetry.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.680]   And then-
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.520]   - Wait, is that real?
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.960]   The New York Times Games one?
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.560]   - Ooh.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.600]   - Hold on.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.080]   - No, no, look at the, yeah, but look at the date.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.840]   Look at the date, 2017.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.200]   Look at this nonsense.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.600]   Yeah, so they went back and found something.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.400]   It is funny though.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.280]   So in 2017, New York Times Games tweeted,
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.520]   yes, hi, it's not a swastika, honest to God.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.240]   No one sits down to make a crossword puzzle and says,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.160]   hey, you know what would look cool.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.000]   That's funny.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.600]   That's legitimately funny, but that's from 2017.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.880]   So they've had this issue, which goes to show
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.720]   crossword puzzles have to be,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.400]   I learned this from the Will Shorts documentary.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.320]   They have to be,
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.400]   there's some sort of symmetry that the designers like to do.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.040]   And so this is a common form of symmetry.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.520]   I think like this shape,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.360]   that rough shape probably comes up a lot.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.160]   It's just an artifact of the constraints
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.640]   of making a crossword puzzle.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.880]   - So funny.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.720]   - All right, this is-
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.600]   - And even like when I saw like,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.720]   there are people on the left trying to dunk on Meghan McCain
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.600]   and like, they'd be like, for the record,
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.320]   I am very pro-Israel.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.680]   And then they would have to make their,
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.240]   like you would have to preface it.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.560]   You have to, you know, on Twitter,
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.960]   when I was super political,
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.400]   you'd have to give all your like bona fides
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.520]   before you make a dunk, just on the left.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.040]   So if I'm gonna dunk on someone on the right,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.880]   I'd have to be like,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.040]   while I am aware of my white straight cis privilege,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.520]   also, Ted Cruz, you're a fuck face.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.440]   Like I would always have to like, whatever.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.080]   I used to call it like progressive disclaimers.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.960]   - Well, because you have,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.440]   you get dunk splashback is what you're trying to avoid.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.600]   Like you're coming in the dunk,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.840]   but then you get the splashback dunk of like,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.680]   okay, I get it.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.240]   Dunk splashback is something you have to avoid.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.080]   I get it.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.040]   And it always, and I'm sure it always works.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.000]   You have to carefully do all your disclaimers.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.840]   Okay.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.000]   - Yeah, everything was fine for me.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.520]   - Yeah, and you were happy.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.880]   So moral of the story.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.560]   Oh man, I feel like the internet's like extra,
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.280]   extra slimy this week.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.440]   - Yeah.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.920]   - All right, let's see here.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.960]   This one's not gonna help us.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.920]   - Something good, roll the dice.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.720]   - Here's an article that was trending in the New York Post.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.560]   I'm sure it'll be fine.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.520]   All right, here we go.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.520]   Elon Musk briefly suspends Taylor Lorenz's Twitter account
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.760]   for doxing, doxing in quotation marks.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.480]   Oh my God, there's so much internet culture again,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.040]   injected in one headline.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.160]   - I always assumed if there was a headline
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.440]   that somehow found a way to combine Elon Musk
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.120]   and Taylor Lorenz, just like the pits of hell
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.560]   would actually open, like that was the code in the lock
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   where you had to put all those letters together.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.920]   And then suddenly you just heard like a cackle
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.800]   in the distance, bells start to ring.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.840]   And you're like, this is it.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.000]   - Birds fly by overhead and Amy Grant emerges
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.840]   from the ground.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.520]   - Yeah.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.400]   - Salt Bay ascends to his throne.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.800]   (laughing)
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.000]   He's sort of an anti-crash type figure.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.960]   So they've done it.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.040]   You've done it New York Post.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.280]   You got doxing, Musk and Taylor Lorenz all in the same.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.120]   Can I just say before-
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.840]   - Good work you pack of assholes.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.240]   - Before we get into this, let me just say
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.960]   this page also features why I think the internet
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.640]   is an urgent necessity.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.720]   Look to the trending now second article.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.920]   I'm gonna read this headline.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.760]   - Okay.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.360]   - Man with World War I explosive lodged in his rectum
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.520]   sparks a bomb scare, hospital evacuated,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.840]   including a picture of a glove doctor's hand
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.560]   holding a very large piece of ordinance.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.280]   I'm just, that's what we need the internet for.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.400]   That's what we need the internet for.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.240]   - We're doing it.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.080]   - There it is.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.800]   - Cal can you, it's weird.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.480]   I know I've been outraged by Taylor Lorenz stories before,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.600]   but I feel like they've all just become
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.880]   this sort of like gobbledy goop amalgamation
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.280]   like in my head of this just like internet monster lady
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.600]   that when someone goes, who's Taylor Lorenz?
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.000]   I just go, ah, she's that, you know, the awful,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.480]   the reason I'm not liberal anymore.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.840]   She's like one of those.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.800]   But I don't remember, I remember like,
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.760]   I think one of the most recent ones wasn't even political,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.720]   but she like posted a tweet about how like
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.120]   she keeps her thermostat up to like 90 degrees every day
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.240]   or some shit and everyone was like, you're a lizard.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.200]   And then that was like two days of the internet.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   I think she tried to get someone at her work fired
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.160]   for being problematic.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.720]   I don't know, but I think she's just been like
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.040]   a problem for years.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.240]   And, but I, can you define for people who don't know?
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.200]   Taylor Lorenz, by the way,
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.440]   that's a better example than Glenn Greenwald.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.800]   That's the example of like,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.240]   if you are on social media too much,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.080]   you know who Taylor Lorenz is.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.920]   - Right.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.760]   - She's just a writer.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.600]   - Right, so it's a name that either,
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.520]   like for some people, basically the right,
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.720]   and also some, I think of the like,
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.840]   whatever you call it,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.400]   like the alt middle sort of new centrist,
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.080]   intellectual dark web crowd as well.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.600]   The sort of like slightly left or slightly right of center,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.560]   but are annoyed at elite culture.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.280]   For them, yeah, she is a lizard person.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.520]   All right, so I can kind of explain it
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.240]   because technically we have sort of the same job.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.480]   Like we're, Taylor and I both exist
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.440]   within the larger world of journalists
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.560]   who write about technology.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.080]   So she writes about it.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   - Oh, I didn't even know she was a tech reporter.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.240]   - She's a tech reporter, yeah.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.880]   So she writes about it for the Washington Post.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.720]   I think I have that right.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.320]   Sort of like I write about it for the New Yorker.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.160]   There's like a-
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.520]   - I've never heard one story about her involving that.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.360]   - That is interesting.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.200]   So you didn't even know that.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.960]   So you know, like she's a hated figure from some people.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.200]   - I've seen every story.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.840]   I'm pretty sure like Tim Pool took out like a billboard,
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.160]   making fun of her like a couple of years ago.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.120]   - And you have no idea what she actually did
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:38.960]   for a living.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.080]   - Never seen her and the word tech in the same room.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.920]   - Interesting.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.760]   - Fascinating. - Interesting.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.320]   Okay, so here's the deal with Taylor Laurent.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.520]   So in the world of tech reporting,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.160]   she is of this, there's a group of reporters
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.640]   who sort of emerged in the last five years
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.560]   that focus a lot on internet culture, right?
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.640]   And the, it's a, the school of thought from these writers
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.800]   is it's so of the moment and complicated
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.680]   that you have to yourself be immersed in internet culture.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.960]   Like you are a figure of internet culture.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.840]   You're in it, you're up to your eyeballs in it,
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.200]   and then you report on it.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.120]   And so the reporting has more of a like timely,
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.320]   but also more of a subjective type bent to it,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.800]   more of a conversational type into it.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.040]   So it's very different than, you know,
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.440]   like an old Walt Mossberg, Wall Street Journal article
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.160]   on the Apple II, where it's, you know,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.600]   let's talk about this new company
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.140]   and it's grown to this size and here's the new features.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.680]   It's like, I'm in this world.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.280]   And the idea is, and there's a couple other reporters
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.760]   in the same vein, all of them have become,
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.280]   it's all, it's very, it's a controversial way to do it.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.000]   You attract controversy because you throw yourself
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.400]   into internet culture so that you can better report on it.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.720]   So I think that's part of what's going on.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.280]   So she's a reporter and so she's really involved
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.560]   in internet culture and has built up her own brand.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.580]   - Is she like an agent provocateur, essentially?
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.840]   Like throws herself into it, does some dumb shit,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.160]   internet attacks her, and then she gets to go
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.680]   as someone who's immersed in this, you know what I mean?
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.440]   - Yeah, I think, and I don't know her reporting super well,
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.600]   though I am a post subscriber.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.880]   I mean, I think the issue is she's involved.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.560]   So like the whole way this particular sub niche
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.760]   of tech reporting works is you get involved in it.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.640]   Like you're like talking to people online,
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.820]   you're on Twitter, you're on these different platforms,
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.660]   you're going back and forth.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.100]   So she's kind of involved in internet memes and causes
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.440]   and things that are happening and writing about it.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.160]   And I think it's the collision of the two
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.540]   that creates all of the controversial heat around her.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.700]   So it's not someone just saying from a distance,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.220]   for example, you know, this is going on,
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.500]   she'll sort of get involved in the fight.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.840]   So I think that the right, and then the sort of centrist,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.200]   right of center crowd doesn't like her
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.240]   because I think she has like a standard sort of East Coast,
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.420]   you know, educated coastal city sort of perspective
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.340]   on these types of issues.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.160]   Like her perspective, standard-
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.120]   - Yeah, she's trying to get people fired.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.240]   She's like, well, she'll like post pictures of people,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.480]   like not wearing masks, like still on the airplane.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.880]   And she's like, I'm the only one with a mask.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.680]   Like just like that type of thing.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.560]   - Yeah, so I think it's this collision of like, okay,
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.240]   we all have, we all, this is like every like 38 year old
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.680]   we know who lives in Manhattan,
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.120]   but she also writes for these big papers.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.720]   And so it's like this kind of melding,
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.280]   those two worlds kind of meld together.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.720]   It's more personalized.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.920]   It comes across sort of like more subjective.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.720]   And so I think that, so it's like someone on Twitter
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.940]   who also has a column.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.120]   So I think that's kind of going on,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.680]   but also I think it's just the case that if you,
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.840]   once you become like a fully 3D person online
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.160]   and some sort of figure, some sort of figure of power,
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.440]   like you're a writer or something,
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.480]   it really brings in like a lot more hate.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.080]   Also like, you know, not to go left wing on it,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   but people don't like women online.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.760]   Like it's, if you're, there's a lot of that going on.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   So it's a whole messy thing.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.480]   So that, but yeah, so basically I think she's
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.660]   on the standard left-wing side, a lot of issues.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.640]   She's involved in an online, she's tweeting about it.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.120]   She gets involved in controversies.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.400]   I don't know this story well.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.000]   I am assuming that Doxine is referring to the fact
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.360]   that she went hard against libs of TikTok
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.160]   and supposedly, I think she put not on Twitter.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.000]   - She named it.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.520]   - The address, yeah, she named the name
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.560]   and gave the address of the founder.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.000]   I've also, I was trying to look at this a little more.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.500]   I think there's something about like, she does a lot of,
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.400]   she'll really push hard to cancel people.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.360]   And then when people push back, we'll say like,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.400]   why is everyone being mean to me?
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.960]   And like, this is harassment.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.840]   - She's complained so much about harassment.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.440]   I remember the libs of TikTok one.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.540]   She complained so much about harassment.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.440]   And then yeah, straight up was just like,
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.600]   here's who this person is.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.520]   And it's like trying to reach members of, you know,
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.880]   libs of TikToks like family to like, you know, whatever.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.560]   And then, but she says, you know,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.440]   that's part of being a journalist and blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.480]   And it's just,
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.720]   it's just at the center of all the wrong things, man.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.920]   - First of all, I think it's the most stressful,
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.680]   like the most stressful job you could have in the world
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.800]   would be like Taylor Lawrence
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.760]   or to be like Matt Walsh or Ben Shapiro.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.200]   Like if you constantly have to be like litigating
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.640]   online cultural battles with tweets and this and that,
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.020]   like how stressful, but your career depends on you
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.600]   constantly being visible.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.200]   A, I just have empathy for all of them
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.640]   because that sounds incredibly stressful.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.760]   B, I think as an outside observer,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.200]   it's actually kind of an interesting thing to have a few,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.060]   it's a train wreck for them and it's messy,
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.480]   but to have some people that are like completely
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.800]   caught up in internet culture,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.240]   writing about internet culture as internet culture
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.520]   strangles and drowns them.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.800]   It's like actually like a kind of interesting
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   from a performance art way of actually capturing
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.840]   the reality of this crazy whirlwind that is internet culture.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.460]   - Dude, I meet a lot of celebrities who are just like,
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.980]   they're like, I love it.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.580]   I love going at people and like, I don't give a shit.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.060]   And like, I just think me and you don't have that
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.940]   because even when I was doing it,
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.780]   I was who you're talking about.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.820]   I was miserable.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.140]   I was having panic attack on panic attack.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.320]   I was like, couldn't put my phone down,
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.300]   but like there are some people,
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.440]   and I don't know if it's just,
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.100]   they have this fucking American psycho part of their brain
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.140]   where they can turn it off
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.940]   or maybe they're just more mature than me,
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.540]   but they can just go to war all day,
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.920]   like playing fucking Call of Duty, but it's real life.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.800]   And then be like, all right, peace and go.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.900]   But I remember dude, I got into a fight.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.500]   I got into a fight once with Josh Marshall
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.900]   from Talking Points Memo.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.380]   And I even took a screenshot
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.980]   'cause he said the exact quote he said to me,
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.380]   I forget what bullshit I said was,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.620]   "Fuck you freedom fighter."
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.020]   And I was like, ha ha ha.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.900]   But like later he tweeted,
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.000]   I'm like, I was ignoring my partner, right?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.340]   While fighting with this guy.
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.780]   And then later he tweeted like,
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.540]   all right, I'm going back to the beach with my kids.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.140]   And I'm like, were you fighting with me
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.780]   while you were at the beach with your children?
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.420]   And I think that's where me and him, right?
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.820]   Like I was in a fucking failing relationship.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.700]   That's where you have to kind of check yourself
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.740]   and be like, all right, now it is pathological, it is bad.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.400]   You have to get your affairs in order.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.540]   - Well, that's where I have,
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.980]   see my issue is I have a very hard time
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.340]   sustaining madness at people.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.680]   I like people, maybe it's 'cause I don't use the internet.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.420]   I knew that would change, but I like people.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.500]   I can see, I have a very easy time imagining
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.780]   the sort of goodwill, just lurking behind people,
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.220]   getting past what they say.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.060]   I have-
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.260]   - A more frat boy way to put that is like,
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.380]   I'm rooting for a good time.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.100]   - Yeah, and I like people, like people are interesting.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.540]   I don't know, people are interesting.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.380]   I think most people are interesting.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.300]   I think, you know, yeah, I like people.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   I've heard I'm getting mad.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.620]   I look at Taylor Renz and I'm thinking,
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.940]   it might've been bad for their career,
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.800]   but man, if Elon had done a permanent ban
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.440]   of her from Twitter, from a mental,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.200]   like she would probably look back at that 10 years from now
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.400]   from a mental health perspective
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.960]   and been like, "This is the best thing that ever happened."
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.200]   Like she was free.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.040]   - I give it-
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.880]   - She was free, it must be a terror for someone like that.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.040]   - I would give it three days before Taylor Renz
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.800]   was like doing ayahuasca in Peru and like finds God.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.200]   - Universe's love, yeah.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.480]   - Sets her thermostat to a normal person temperature,
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.240]   and which is like, "What have I been doing with my life?"
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.980]   Like literally like you come out of a fucking coma.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.860]   The days that I, and by the way,
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.660]   I wanna ask you advice at some point or now.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.260]   I take Instagram off my,
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.700]   Twitter just doesn't exist on my phone,
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.260]   only on my desktop, like you said.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.420]   Instagram I have to post,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.980]   so I've been doing what you told me,
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.760]   and I take it off my phone on the weekends.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.520]   But when I was with Tim Kennedy at the range
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.660]   doing all these courses,
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.100]   and this weekend was the first time
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.280]   I actually had my phone completely off, much different.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.680]   Because even when my phone is on,
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.960]   I catch myself going down, "I" for Instagram,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.240]   and then being like, "Oh, it's not there."
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.560]   Or even suddenly if a giant weight comes up,
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.040]   if I suddenly have to go to the mechanic or something,
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.520]   I'm like, "Oh, I can just re-download the app,
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.280]   and then it sends me a code, and then I can get back on it."
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.040]   Whereas when my phone was just completely off or away,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.840]   that's when you have that ayahuasca in Peru,
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.980]   and I'm free.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.860]   - Yeah, like all the time.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.580]   Look, I'm a big fan of that.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.420]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.340]   - Yeah.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.380]   Don't bring it to the range,
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.540]   don't bring it to the mechanic,
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.980]   or have the burner phone.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.780]   - Don't bring it on a date.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.980]   - Don't bring it on a date, yeah.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.820]   Yeah, for God's sakes, don't.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.340]   Yeah, don't. - Yeah, or with your kid.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.180]   - Let me ask you a quick follow-up question on that though.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.700]   - Yeah.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.300]   - Is Instagram like Twitter, or is it different?
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.380]   - It's so different.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.180]   There's different negative aspects to it.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.360]   So for me, I like it more because for the most part,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.440]   it's people sharing positive things,
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.800]   and it doesn't move as fast as TikTok.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.240]   Like TikTok, I was on for two minutes,
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.600]   and it was like the first time someone,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.040]   maybe the only time someone offered me cocaine
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.020]   in like a shady bathroom, and he was a shady guy,
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.040]   and you just immediately go,
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.320]   "I don't wanna be a part of this,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.280]   and I'm just not gonna, my life is not gonna involve cocaine."
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.840]   That's how I felt with TikTok.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.160]   It was my friend, Kendall Rusing,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.000]   who's this awesome jujitsu world champion,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.060]   she just did my podcast, I just did her podcast,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.780]   and she was like, "Look," and it was just like,
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.300]   "New video, new video, new video, new video,"
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.180]   and I was just like, "How do you do this?"
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.500]   And she's such an emotionally intelligent, rad person,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.540]   and it was her and her sister,
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.060]   and they were trying to explain TikTok to me,
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.980]   and it was that cocaine thing,
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.580]   where I was like, "It will ruin me.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.740]   You will find me in a gutter with my phone on top of me,
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.740]   and some fucking Asian-Korean dance team, whatever."
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:44.300]   But Instagram, at first, I'll say when I go on podcasts,
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.280]   you know, I'm more popular on Twitter,
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.080]   but follow me on Instagram, it's where I'm happier,
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.000]   'cause it is, it's a lot of self-help memes,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.420]   and a video of a puppy doing a dance, or whatever.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.000]   I only follow fighters, spiritual people,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.440]   people who I can learn from,
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.620]   you can get instructionals and tutorials.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.900]   Where it does get bad is just all social media,
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.120]   except maybe not Twitter.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.300]   Actually, this might just be Instagram-specific.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.040]   People are posting their highlight reel, right?
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.580]   It's like me going on a date,
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.940]   and just being like, "Oh, I played the Sydney Opera House,
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.340]   I did this, I did that."
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.180]   And she's like, "Aren't you divorced, though?"
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.800]   And I'm like, "We don't need to talk about that.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.460]   Here's a picture of me at the opera house."
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.180]   So it's just your hits, so it will make other people,
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.060]   and I'm saying this as a 40-year-old dude,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.980]   let alone if you're a kid, you look at other people.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.140]   That's why I post mostly mental health stuff,
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.900]   like, "Hey, man, today was really hard for me.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.200]   I was really depressed.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.100]   I'm going through this.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.840]   You're not alone, blah, blah, blah."
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.960]   Because for the most part,
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.040]   remember, I don't follow any negative accounts.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.540]   There are still, there are angry political accounts on there.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.420]   There are still whatever.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.660]   But even with that, following just positive people,
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.720]   I'll look at my pastor posting a Christmas picture
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.860]   with his kids and his wife, and be like,
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.780]   "I'll never have that."
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.660]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.520]   You still have that forced comparison,
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.860]   which you have to be very careful about.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.740]   - So it's different poison.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.820]   So like Twitter, you spend all day on Twitter.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.560]   You're convinced that we're like 12 hours away
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.740]   from Nazis forcing your kids to gay marry drag queens.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.380]   - Right. (laughs)
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.100]   - And you go on Instagram,
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.180]   and you're convinced that like everyone got in
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.540]   one last workout at the gym before their Caribbean vacation.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.700]   - And you're so alone,
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.560]   you're gonna be forced to marry a Nazi drag queen
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.860]   because no one else wants you,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.580]   and you'll never have the beautiful family
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.420]   that all your friends have.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.940]   Like, I guess it's okay the Nazis
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.820]   are gonna force me to do this
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.580]   because I'm alone in the world.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.460]   And yeah, and look at how happy.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.300]   Interesting.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.120]   Okay, so different.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.340]   And then you're saying TikTok is just-
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.300]   - And you also do get addicted to scrolling
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.460]   because there's also like, all of my fighters,
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.420]   yeah, man, they're posting like Musashi quotes,
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.320]   and they're posting get to the gym or whatever.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.040]   But if you're just scrolling and half reading them,
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.500]   as opposed to you're reading "The Book of Five Rings"
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.020]   by Musashi, or you're watching a documentary,
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.300]   or you're immersing yourself in something,
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.420]   you're kind of just getting, you know,
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.980]   half digested, repurposed,
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.260]   - Yeah. - Brown quote.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.100]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.460]   - Yeah.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.880]   - And so, yeah, so that's hard too,
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.660]   because you feel like you're doing positive things,
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.520]   but you're not retaining any of it.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.060]   So you're under the illusion like, well, I just,
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.900]   before you know it,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.740]   you spend an hour scrolling through self-help memes,
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.140]   when what you should have done was take a walk
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.780]   or go to the gym or call a friend.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.940]   - Yeah, you know, I once, a Brene Brown story,
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:40.940]   I once spent some time in the green room
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.380]   at Lincoln Center backstage, just me and Brene Brown,
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.100]   we were both speaking at the same event,
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.260]   and we spent some time together.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.500]   That's my Brene Brown story.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.340]   - I would have gotten jealous
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.180]   if you posted that picture on Instagram.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.860]   - Brene Brown story number, oh, and this event, by the way,
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.460]   this was back when they used to have all these conferences
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.100]   that were sort of vaguely based on blogs.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.700]   And so I just remember the surly teensters
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.580]   who were back in the backstage
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.060]   that were just like bemused and confused,
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.660]   like what the hell is going on?
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.020]   Like, who are these kids?
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.700]   - Not interested about Brene Brown
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.540]   telling them to like discover their shame.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.540]   - This is my other, and this is gonna make me seem
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.700]   like a completely out of touch, you know,
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.420]   patriarchal whatever.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.100]   But then we used to run in a lot of the same circles
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.300]   'cause I used to give a lot more talks
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.140]   at these conferences.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.300]   First time I saw Brene Brown,
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.220]   this would have been like, I don't know when this was,
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.140]   11, 2011, 2012.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.340]   We're again, speaking at the same event.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.780]   And I was there with a couple of friends.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.860]   I won't say their names, they're well-known.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.420]   And she came up and gave her talk
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.860]   and the crowd was literally dancing.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.940]   Like she had them up there dancing.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.580]   And just the energy was off the charts.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.260]   Like, clearly this is a star, right?
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.220]   Like she was gonna be a star.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.540]   And I remember turning to my friend, another guy,
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.100]   and saying, "I literally don't understand
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.380]   "a single thing she just said."
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.540]   Like, I cannot tell you what this talk was just about.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.620]   And she had the entire audience down.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.820]   I guess it just shows, right?
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.220]   Everyone has their own love language.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.100]   So that was my first experience with Brene Brown
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.540]   was she was clearly on her way to being a superstar.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.460]   And as a like 27 year old dude,
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.740]   I did not understand what she was talking about.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.980]   - I've had so many moments like that
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.180]   where I'd be watching some new comic
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.460]   and I'm like, this is terrible.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.260]   Pause, they're gonna be a star.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.100]   - Oh, you could just tell.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.940]   I could just tell.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.740]   I was like, she's gonna be huge.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.860]   I mean, yeah.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.700]   Okay.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.060]   All right, we got one more story here.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.900]   Let's see here.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.740]   - Let's put it on a high note.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.980]   - Yeah, before we bring in our other guest host,
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.580]   Brene Brown, come on.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.900]   Come on in.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.740]   Here we go.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.100]   All right, from Kiss the band.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.540]   A tweet.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.020]   Happy 77th birthday, Peter Chris.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.380]   We hope your special day rocks.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.220]   Enjoy.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.020]   It's good news, happy Twitter.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.860]   - It's good news.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:53.980]   Happy Twitter.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.420]   You have to dig so hard
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.420]   that it has to be just the corporate intern of the band.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.300]   Unproblematically, there's no take.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.420]   It's just this man is 77.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.260]   - Yeah, looks great.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.460]   - Remember him from the band Kiss.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.500]   I hope you have a special day.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.100]   And that's it.
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.020]   Did I click it?
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.100]   Because I thought Peter Chris
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.100]   was killed in like a murder suicide.
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.140]   Of course I did.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.300]   Of course I did.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.780]   But it made me, you know, when I see,
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.020]   I don't know the last time I've listened to Kiss,
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:33.020]   but Cal and I grew up listening to guitar rock.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.260]   There was a kid named Ben.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.300]   There was a kid named Ben in our class.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.260]   Kind of bigger.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.580]   Do you remember who that was?
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.420]   - Ben.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.260]   All right, keep going.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.100]   Let's see if I remember.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.740]   - Well, I just never hung out with him ever.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.100]   And just one day he goes,
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.620]   "I have an extra ticket to see Kiss.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.820]   Do you want to go?"
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.740]   Ben like Goldsmith or something.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.180]   - Yes, that sounds familiar.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.140]   - Yeah.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.420]   Someone that Will Shorts would not have liked.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.620]   - Not sufficiently, yeah, exactly.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.460]   I get you.
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.300]   Oh, there we go.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.140]   I get you.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:03.980]   I get you.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.860]   - And we went to see Kiss, I think with Ben's dad.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.380]   'Cause again, in high school,
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.420]   you were going to see,
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.940]   I saw Dave Matthews Band with John Evans' dad.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.180]   I saw Santana with my dad.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.340]   - Nice John Evans poll.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.740]   That's a good Pennington poll.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.900]   My first friend,
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.460]   my first friend moving to Pennington, New Jersey.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.300]   - Stop it.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.140]   - Jonathan Evans.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.180]   Jonathan Evans lived behind me.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.460]   - But before he moved,
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.140]   he lived down the street,
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.380]   two houses down from where we,
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.220]   there we go.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.060]   So first of all,
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.740]   fascinating for our audience.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.060]   I think everyone is loving this.
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.140]   - He was the manager of our high school band,
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.020]   which just meant,
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.620]   guys, if you were ever in a high school band
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.460]   and you had a manager,
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.420]   it was just the kid who you couldn't tell not to come
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.700]   and he doesn't play an instrument.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.340]   And so he would just sit there
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.300]   and like one day have dreams of,
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.140]   you know,
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.460]   making money from us in a Paul Giamatti,
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.100]   NWA type fashion.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.740]   - Well, and not to go on a tangent here,
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.700]   but we've talked about this before you and I,
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.780]   I don't know if we've talked on the air before,
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.860]   but this is the key with high school rock bands.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.340]   It's the aura,
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.620]   the aura you put off.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.780]   So the fact that he wanted to be a manager for your band
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.340]   is because your band was cool.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.180]   - Yep.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.020]   - Right?
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:15.860]   What was it?
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.540]   What's it called?
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.380]   Progressions or something?
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.220]   Am I thinking about the right band?
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.060]   - Oh, you are not.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.940]   It was a Simpsons reference,
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.020]   which will make you very happy.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.420]   Pray for Mojo.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.260]   - Okay.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.100]   It was Pray for Mojo.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.380]   Okay.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.580]   - Homer gets a helper monkey
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.820]   and Homer starts getting the helper monkey drunk and stuff.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.900]   And the helper monkey's handler finally comes back
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.260]   to get Mojo and Mojo could only type into a thing.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.100]   And he just wrote,
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.460]   "Pray for Mojo."
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.380]   And that was it.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.560]   - Whereas my band in high school,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.900]   we were technically proficient.
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.740]   - Yes.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.620]   - We wrote our own songs.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.340]   We were good at our instruments.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.780]   Right?
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.260]   But I went to Dartmouth.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.220]   Our lead singer went to Stanford.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.380]   Our drummer went to NYU.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.220]   Right?
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.940]   - We were the Brene Brown of the high school bands.
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:02.780]   - Yes.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.460]   And I was the, yeah,
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.140]   the Cal Newport of high school bands
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.700]   giving a speech about whatever.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.900]   And so we couldn't,
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:11.980]   and so we just did not have the right aura.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.820]   So we actually wrote,
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.820]   "I gotta find this tape."
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.020]   So it was down at the beach.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.960]   This was a high school student with our drummer
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.780]   and our lead singer, Chris and Mike.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.460]   And we had our four track recorder with us.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.380]   And we recorded this.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.220]   I've told you about this,
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.060]   it's an awesome song.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.620]   It was a song called "Our Bands Unpopular."
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.140]   - I'm so nervous.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.620]   - No, it was a great song.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.020]   We wrote a song about our band
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.660]   called "Our Bands Unpopular."
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.500]   We were good.
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.320]   And by evidence is,
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.740]   every time we would play at our school
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:36.580]   at a battle of the bands,
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.180]   we would lose no matter what.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.180]   We, as soon as we left
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.540]   and went to the Princeton FET,
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.900]   like an open to all bands,
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.100]   battle of the bands, we won.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.560]   It's like we had the chops,
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.380]   but if you knew who we were,
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.660]   if you knew who we were,
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.500]   there you go.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.860]   - That's so sad and funny.
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.820]   - It's sad, it's funny.
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.900]   It's of great interest to the audience.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.420]   But I'm looking at these replies to the tweets
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.780]   and it's all nice.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:58.940]   - It's all happy birthday.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.780]   - Yeah.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:00.620]   - There's no,
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.020]   "Hey, happy birthday, Peter, Chris.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.580]   Gene Simmons is a rapist."
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.100]   It's like, I mean, probably,
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.780]   but like, that's not what we're talking about.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.180]   - That's not what we're talking about here.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.020]   Here we go,
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.300]   "Master, the only cat mat ever.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.060]   Congratulations."
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.900]   - Looking good.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.860]   - "The guy looks fantastic.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.140]   Playing the drums is the best workout you can get."
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.340]   - Hell yeah, dude.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.180]   - Yeah.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.300]   - The best workout you can get,
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.140]   well, it's kind of weird,
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:20.980]   but that's fine.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:21.820]   - It's weird.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.580]   - That was a drummer who just got dumped
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.340]   because he spends too much time at practice
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.180]   and he's just like,
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.540]   "Ugh, she saw this.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.060]   She knows I'm jacking again."
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.420]   - Yeah, man, I was gonna get my biceps,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.260]   my trapezoids.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.100]   My trapezoids.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:35.940]   All right, this makes me feel good.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.620]   - I've seen a lot of potbelly drummers, you guys.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.260]   - So now I'm kind of really scrolling here.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:41.980]   Now I'm kind of curious if there's a-
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.180]   - Are you digging for the first bad one?
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.940]   - I kind of am digging for the...
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.860]   Here's, okay.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.700]   - By the way-
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.540]   - Is this a secret bad one?
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.460]   Happy birthday, Peter.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.460]   Mine is January 6th, soon to be 58.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.180]   See, maybe that's a little bit of a subtle-
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.580]   - January 6th was like a code.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.420]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:02.300]   I also feel like if you're looking to say something bad
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.860]   or cancel a band from that era, it's not hard.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.380]   Like they all probably did terrible things
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.460]   to underage people.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.140]   - Yeah.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.260]   - And so the fact that it wasn't in the first like 50
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.020]   that you scrolled, looking good.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.580]   - Yeah, so that's happy Twitter.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.180]   That's like 2006 Twitter.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.860]   It's like, I'm not really sure what we're doing on here.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.700]   It's kind of a party.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.460]   Like not that many people are here yet.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.660]   Kiss is fun.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.940]   Yeah, this guy is fun.
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:27.780]   Hey, happy birthday.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.620]   Look, here's what I ate today.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.460]   That's great.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.140]   You know, this is, yeah, this is good, right?
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:31.980]   You know?
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.780]   It's like, look, I made my crossword puzzle
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.020]   look like a swastika.
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:35.860]   That wasn't easy.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.460]   I had to align it and be like, it's great.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.300]   You know, you're like good.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.700]   That's difficult, you know?
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.500]   - A lot of alignment involved.
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.820]   So guys, I hope you know, when you listen to this show,
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.700]   we will always try to bring you at least one or two,
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.940]   also happy ones.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.260]   You're gonna hear the happy one.
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.180]   And at first you're gonna be very suspect,
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.460]   a little bit of Stockholm syndrome,
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.700]   not really know what's going on,
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.340]   wondering if you're walking into a trap.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.260]   Sometimes it's just the guy from Kiss's fucking birthday.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   - Yeah, or a guy has a piece of ordinance in his record.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.820]   - I mean, we still made it about simple stuff,
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.620]   simple house ad band, but you know.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.500]   - Yeah.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.060]   All right, well, we should wrap it up then.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.660]   So Jamie, tell us about the podcast or where we,
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.260]   your podcast or where people can find you.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.380]   - You guys, I host a mental health comedy podcast
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.940]   called Advice Not Taken.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.380]   We're actually doing video now.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.860]   So since you guys are on YouTube,
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:26.100]   it would be sweet if you went over to youtube.com/jamiekilstein
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:26.940]   hit subscribe.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.900]   You can fucking mute that shit.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.740]   I don't know.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.300]   Just give me enough subscribers where I'm getting money.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.580]   And then Advice Not Taken is on Spotify and iTunes.
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.300]   I'm really proud of it, especially around the holidays.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.420]   We've been talking a lot about depression
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.340]   and mental health shit and being alone for the holidays,
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.820]   but in a way that's funny.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.100]   And I talk about what a fucking disaster I am.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.340]   Once again, you can follow me
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.940]   if you guys are on Instagram @thejamiekilstein.
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.780]   And that's it, Cal hit it.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.940]   - Yeah, you can, my podcast is called Deep Questions
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.860]   with Cal Newport.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.860]   I also play in a band called Amy Grant's Haunted Barn.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.460]   - That's such a good name for a band.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.740]   - Isn't that a great band name?
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:06.580]   That'd be awesome.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.420]   So there we go.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.740]   All right, everyone, we'll try to be back next week
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.580]   or the week after.
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.420]   I guess it's the holidays.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.260]   We'll have to figure that out.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.100]   - Holidays next week.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.060]   But guys, I gotta tell you,
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.620]   Cal and I talk off the air about,
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.580]   I mean, to be honest with you,
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.300]   this show will probably go on
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.900]   even if it doesn't get popular because it's so fun.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.780]   But I really do believe in the show
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.100]   and I think it could be something cool.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.860]   And it's a way for me and Cal just to decompress
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.100]   and make jokes with you guys.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.100]   And we wanna get to the point
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.620]   where you start sending us in articles.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.980]   Leave things in the comment section
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:40.060]   that you want our producer to get to us and talk about.
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.740]   It's a way that we can talk about politics
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.420]   without it taking over our lives.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.260]   We can still kinda know what's going on.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.300]   We can laugh from afar
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:51.100]   as we're trying to lead happy, healthier, deeper lives.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.500]   So please spread the word about the show.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.780]   Like, review, leave comments,
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.140]   all of that shit you hear on other podcasts.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.220]   - All right, so enjoy your holiday.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:59.060]   Put down your phone.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:57:59.900]   We'll see you soon.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.740]   (upbeat music)
