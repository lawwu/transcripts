[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast. We hope you had a wonderful Christmas weekend
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.160]   to reflect on the Savior and His birth and His sacrifice for us.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.680]   Jesus is beautiful, and we talk about His beauty a lot as a way of fleshing out
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.080]   what it means to have faith and to treasure Christ for all that He is for us.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.600]   But He is fundamentally beautiful. That's common language for us here at DG,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   but that language leads to a problem too and to a question from a podcast listener named Adam.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.160]   "Pastor John, how does a masculine Christian, a man's man, see Jesus as beautiful? It's odd
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.160]   and uncomfortable for me, a man, to look upon another man, even the God-man, and say, 'Beautiful.'
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.840]   Yet I believe that expectation of men, indeed all people, is not only taught in Scripture,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.200]   but a necessary ingredient to saving faith. This is troublesome and quite unnerving to me.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.320]   Can you help me come to terms with the awkwardness I feel here?"
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.400]   So should we feel awkward as men, or Christians in general, women or men,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.560]   should we feel awkward, but especially men,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.520]   seeing Jesus as beautiful? That was the first thing he said. And then
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   should we feel awkward to look upon the God-man and say, "Beautiful"?
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.360]   Well, the answer is yes and no. Yes and no. If the term "beautiful" carries with it
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   connotations of any sensuality at all, there should be an awkwardness in calling Jesus beautiful.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.520]   Indeed, I would say, if the preponderance of what we mean when we say "beautiful"
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.760]   in reference to Jesus refers to His physical appearance, we should feel awkward.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   And here's a couple reasons. First, because when the Bible does talk about the physical
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.120]   appearance of the Son of Man on earth, it describes Him as the opposite of beautiful.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.640]   Isaiah 53, 2, "He grew up before Him like a young plant, like a root out of dry ground. He had no
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   form or majesty that we should look upon Him, and no beauty, no beauty that we should desire Him."
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.480]   52, 14, "As many were astonished at You, His appearance was so marred beyond human semblance,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.920]   and His form beyond that of the children of mankind." So we should get out of our minds
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.720]   all notions that calling Jesus beautiful says anything about His physical appearance
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.880]   while He was on the earth. He was not physically beautiful as far as we know,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   and certainly not at the end of His life during His sufferings.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.160]   In His exalted state, His resurrection glorified body,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   the way He's described in Revelation 1, for example, it would be completely appropriate
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:28.800]   to attach the word "beautiful" in a very exalted way. Here's what it says, "I saw one like a Son
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.080]   of Man clothed in a long robe and with a golden sash around His chest. The hairs of His head were
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:44.800]   white like wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.440]   refined in a furnace. His voice was like the roar of many waters. In His right hand He held seven
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:03.360]   stars, and from His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and His face was like the sun shining
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.120]   in full strength." That man is beautiful the way Niagara Falls is beautiful, the way the
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.840]   northern lights are beautiful, the way the Hubble telescope's pictures of the galaxies are beautiful.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:30.640]   Nevertheless, I still stand by my statement if the preponderance of what we mean when we say
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   "beautiful" in reference to Jesus refers to His physical appearance, even His glorified appearance,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:48.640]   we should feel awkward, because—and this is the main answer to Adam's question—because
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.720]   the reason that calling Jesus beautiful is never, neither in His incarnate state
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:05.440]   or His glorified state, the reason is He's never called beautiful fully appropriately because of
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.640]   His physical appearance, no matter how glorious, but rather because of the excellence of His
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:21.280]   character and the greatness of His deeds. When four jets, the blue angels, roar overhead with
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.600]   deafening thunder, aiming at each other from the four points of the compass, they're going 400
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.800]   miles an hour, and as they approach each other ready to collide, suddenly they simultaneously,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.880]   all four, do a 90 degrees in a vertical ascent, and up they go, belly to belly,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:47.040]   straight up in the air, nobody misunderstands when you say "beautiful." Or when an Olympic gymnast
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:56.240]   on the rings swings himself in a double back somersault and suddenly nails a motionless
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:05.200]   iron cross without the slightest swing in the ropes, and you drop your jaw and say "beautiful,"
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:13.840]   nobody misunderstands. Or when a small boat with a family in it is about to be swept away in a
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:22.000]   horrible flood tide rushing through a town, and you get one chance to throw a rope as it comes
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.120]   by, this little boat comes by, and you throw it, and the rope happens to land perfectly in the
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.280]   hands of the one person who could catch it, and the people with tears in their eyes say "beautiful,"
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:43.200]   nobody misunderstands. Or when a father sees his child snatched away by a wild animal, and he
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.520]   throws himself against the animal at the loss of his own life to save his child,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:56.960]   everybody knows what we mean when we say "that was beautiful." Now, when all of that
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:05.680]   beautiful virtue and all of that beautiful achievement are summed up in one person,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.440]   which it is in Jesus, that person is so identified with all of his virtuous capacities and all of his
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:22.560]   magnificent achievements that it is natural—natural, not awkward—natural to call the person himself
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:32.640]   "beautiful" for all those reasons. When Paul said, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   the good news," he meant the utter devotion, the self-sacrifice, the unflinching resolution,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:50.000]   the overflowing love that motivated the feet to move toward the lost made the feet beautiful.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.760]   The feet aren't beautiful. Feet aren't beautiful. They're gross, especially bare feet in primitive
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:05.520]   cultures. Feet on the way to die for others are beautiful feet, no matter what they look like.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:14.320]   And the beauty of Christ that the devil does not want us to see or talk about or celebrate
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:22.000]   is not his physical appearance, but the peculiar glory, the peculiar brightness
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.560]   of all the excellencies that shines most brightly in the sacrifice of Christ on the cross and in
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.000]   the power of the resurrection. That's precisely what Paul meant when he said in 2 Corinthians 4.4,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.400]   "The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:55.440]   of the gospel of the glory or the beauty of Christ." That glory, that beauty, is the beauty
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:04.960]   of his moral perfections expressed in the gospel. So I think Adam is justified in feeling awkward
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.320]   if we carelessly refer to the beauty of Jesus so that it sounds like
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:18.720]   we're adoring his physical appearance. Let's find language. So Adam, join me,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:30.800]   join me in groping for language for men and for women, for language that enables us to revel in
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:40.960]   the unsurpassed moral and spiritual beauty of one who was so marred that we would not have been able
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.280]   to look at him. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Adam, for this really good question.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.160]   And thanks for listening to the podcast. You can find our audio feeds in our episode archive,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.960]   and you can reach us via email like Adam did, all through our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:05.360]   We are going to return on Wednesday, and we have another really good question on the docket. A
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.320]   listener, Amy, wants to know, "Why are women more eager for missions work than men seem to be?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.520]   The statistics seem to bear this point out, and I will ask John Piper on Wednesday
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.040]   why he thinks that's the case." I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.240]   John podcast.
