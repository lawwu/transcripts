[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - The thing that I first learned about Charity Water
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.320]   that made me realize you guys were different
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.680]   is that you have two separate sources for money.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.400]   One covers all the overhead,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.500]   all the way down to the credit card processing fees,
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.600]   and then the other is just directly to go towards causes.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.740]   - The model for Charity Water really came out
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.120]   of just listening to everyday people.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   I said, well, what would make you compelled to give?
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.280]   And the 100% model just came out of that.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.720]   Well, people said, if I knew that 100% of what I gave
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.220]   would actually help people,
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.600]   I'd be more likely to give.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.160]   I said, all right, well, this just needs to look like
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.600]   two separately audited bank accounts,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.160]   and in one bank account,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.440]   I'm gonna raise my hand and go try to find
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.880]   business leaders and entrepreneurs who are not skeptical,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.040]   and actually who wouldn't mind paying
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120]   those unsexy overhead costs.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.280]   And then I can go out to the public and say,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.040]   great, not your problem.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.360]   If you give a dollar or a million dollars,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.240]   every single penny, every dollar will go directly
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.360]   to build these water projects,
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.940]   which get people clean water.
