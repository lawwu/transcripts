[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   How long before Stripe was founded, do you think a product like Stripe could have been invented?
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.720]   Depending on what exactly you define Stripe as being, I think conceivably decades earlier,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.760]   in that, I mean, on some level PayPal is a kind of Stripe.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.800]   And there were many payments companies before PayPal.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.240]   Mostly my story of Stripe is one of market inefficiency.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.640]   And I do wonder, yeah, why much of this didn't happen sooner?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.200]   I always find it really interesting when there's these cases where it wasn't even the case that,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.440]   like, well, it could have been started sooner, but there was nobody in the market.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.520]   There were like many people in the market and they weren't just like random people.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.560]   There were technology companies headquartered in San Francisco who were in the market.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.080]   Do you have some explanation for why it didn't occur to them?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.720]   I'm hesitant to generalize too much because, well, I only have maybe, you know,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.640]   n equals one experience. And so I think it's dangerous to over-extrapolate from that.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.840]   I guess my general view is most products and most businesses,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.560]   things can just be done much better.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.960]   And I think moats are typically kind of overrated.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.120]   And I mean, the payments are a great example of a domain where on a logical basis,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.120]   you would say that there are so many sources of defensibility where there's
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.920]   the network effect of the account holders, and there's the data network effect slash
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.760]   economy of scale, you know, for fraud and so forth. And there are regulatory moats and barriers,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.840]   you know, and, and, and, and yet, you know, not only does Stripe exist,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.040]   but there are lots of other, I mean, there's a whole fintech ecosystem today, right?
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   It's just not that useful to build financial ecosystems that are self-contained, right?
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.520]   A financial island is not that helpful. And this has been Stripe's strategy very
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.800]   deliberately from the beginning where, you know, there were lots of companies when Stripe started
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.080]   out that were trying to sort of do their own thing and go their own way. Whereas our belief was
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.000]   you got these, I mean, it's classic, I guess, Metcalfe law stuff of, you know,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   by enhancing the capabilities of an existing ecosystem, you create quite a bit more value.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.520]   When Stripe started out, Stripe seemed like it definitely wasn't cool. It was, it was sort of
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   the opposite for just a couple of us. And we thought that we could make this the superior
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   payments API. And for the vast majority of its history, Stripe has, I think, attracted people who
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   are drawn to unglamorous infrastructure challenges and problems. We have a very good understanding
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.960]   of our domain and a set of people who actually care about solving the problems and who are,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.280]   I don't know, continually paranoid at the prospect that we might be forgetting something important
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.440]   and sort of trying to figure out what the thing that could supplant Stripe's approaches is and
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   making sure that we build those first. In our discussions internally, a lot of it, and
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   probably the significant majority of it, is still about, okay, where are there actual practical
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.280]   shortcomings and limitations in even our core bread and butter? The adoption of these practices
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.320]   in like really kind of tenacious, like multi-year form is, yeah, just yields really high returns.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.160]   And there may be other organizations that like both ship at that rate and kind of maintain that
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.240]   sort of developer velocity at this kind of combination of scale and reliability and security.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.760]   But I don't think there were that many. And I think it's a real testament to,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.040]   yeah, the remarkable folks at Stripe who made it happen. The best people, you know, consider
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.280]   themselves craftspeople in their domain, and they really, above almost all else, want to work with
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.840]   the best other people. And so I think it's very hard to assemble groups of the best people if you
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.240]   don't take the practice of the work super seriously. I mean, maybe kind of a theme through
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.840]   everything we've talked about is actually taking the goal seriously. And I feel like a lot of what
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.000]   we do at Stripe is, again, I disdain any sort of genius in it. I think it's just the very earnest,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.440]   repeated, serious, and long-term application of taking the goal seriously.
