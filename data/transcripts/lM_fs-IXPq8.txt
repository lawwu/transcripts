[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.480]   All right.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.980]   This next presentation we're going to do is another interview.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.420]   But I have not -- I've decided not to ambush Wade with any questions.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.020]   So I gave him my list of questions before we started.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.160]   He had a week to think about it.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.700]   I even said, "If you want to throw a few slides together
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.360]   to help answer some of these, you can."
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   And so he has a few slides we'll use.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.500]   Our clicker is not working perfectly.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.560]   So we'll be doing the next slide thing.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.700]   But it's going to work out okay.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.840]   For those who don't know Wade, Wade has a PhD and a CFA.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.740]   He is the founder of Retirement Researcher, which is an educational resource
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.780]   for individuals and financial advisors on topics related to retirement income planning.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.220]   He's published a gazillion papers.
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.120]   He's published four books.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.560]   And he's been all over all the journals
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.520]   and publications you would expect somebody of a stature to be in,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.100]   like the Wall Street Journal, Time, Kiplinger's Money, et cetera.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.200]   So very accomplished in his career so far.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.300]   His focus has been on retirement, planning for retirement, helping retirees get
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.900]   through retirement, different types of withdrawals, and things like that.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.340]   So what I like the most about Wade, though, is Wade is not afraid to take another look
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.840]   at something in an unconventional way and say, how can that be useful to retirees?
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.540]   And so we're going to talk about some of those topics today.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.820]   But before we get into it, the first thing I want to talk
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.880]   about is something we run into all the time in medicine.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.520]   I'm a practicing doc, and we have something called the Sunshine Act in medicine,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.800]   where if somebody buys me lunch, like a drug rep buys me lunch, a $15 lunch,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.340]   that goes in a database, a publicly searchable database.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.960]   Medicine's very big on conflicts of interest.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.240]   The financial services industry, not as much.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.980]   But we're going to start talking about that.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.320]   And anyone who wants to make a living today doing anything
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.880]   in financial services has conflicts of interest.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.320]   And, Wade, can you talk a little bit about your conflicts of interest and then more generally
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.420]   about what you think an investor ought to do about conflicts when reading or listening
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.340]   to the words of somebody like you that has conflicts?
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.900]   You know, is disclosure enough, or should the presence of conflicts keep them from,
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.940]   you know, taking your advice and that sort of thing?
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.080]   Can you talk about your conflicts and how people ought to look at them?
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.980]   >> Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.420]   And thank you for having the session before lunch
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.780]   so that people couldn't get tomatoes from their salads to throw at me.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.220]   Oh, it's not working yet.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.780]   Can you hear okay?
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.460]   Okay. So, yeah, so let me -- oh, not quite loud enough.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.140]   All right, so with conflicts, I think in the context of bogleheads looking
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500]   at the forums, the big issue is insurance.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.580]   So I want to talk about the insurance conflicts a little bit.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.940]   First, as presented, it's a little bit of a chicken and an egg problem,
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.500]   but then gets specifically into the conflict issue itself.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.300]   So I was a professor in Japan.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.020]   I was teaching students mainly from emerging market countries.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.780]   I was doing research on pension funds in emerging market countries.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.220]   I wanted to move back to the United States.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.820]   I realized emerging market pension fund research is not going to be
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.260]   of interest to U.S.-based employers.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.700]   So I started looking for, like, what could I do?
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.340]   I studied -- that's when I studied for the CFA exam.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.500]   That's when I came across the 4% rule.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.460]   Now, as part of living in Japan, I had access to the -- it's now owned by Morningstar.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.900]   It was a Dim Sum Stanton March global returns data set.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.500]   And I was just curious, did the idea of the 4% rule in retirement income that was based
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.420]   on U.S. historical data, did that work in other countries?
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.340]   And so this article was published in 2010 when I was still just simply a professor in Japan
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.420]   with no connection to anything in the United States in terms of financial services.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.580]   And the answer is, no, it's really an artifact of U.S. data.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.780]   Now, Canada, too, and this is the original research
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.980]   where I gave the best possible asset allocation rather than looking
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.420]   at just, well, maybe a 50/50 portfolio.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.340]   But generally, the 4% rule didn't work around the world.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.500]   So then I started to read more about retirement income planning.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.820]   I quickly realized that there's very conflicting viewpoints about this.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.980]   So there's -- for a long time, I talked about this idea that there's two schools
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.860]   of thought, probability-based and safety-first.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.540]   And there's just these huge disagreements.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.780]   And you can see a lot of that at the boba heads.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.180]   Questions like, is the 4% rule any good?
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.660]   Is there any role for annuities?
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.500]   All these kinds of questions where you can have people answer them
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.420]   in the exact opposite manner.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.340]   And I just started exploring this more.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.500]   I'm still living in Japan.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.620]   I'm still not at this point -- well, by this point, I was maybe starting
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.260]   to actually look for a job in the U.S. But I'm still pretty much isolated
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.220]   from U.S. financial services.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.100]   I wrote an article on this idea of the efficient frontier for retirement income,
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.660]   which really -- it doesn't say that annuities are a replacement for stocks.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.580]   It's -- the conversation's always around bonds.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.820]   And the idea of the efficient frontier for retirement income,
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.180]   instead of looking at stock bond allocations, you look at allocations
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.900]   of stocks in lifetime income annuities.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.780]   And that's still pretty like chicken and egg here, pure research.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.020]   Now, this is where the conflicts come in.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.540]   As I move back to the United States, insurance companies want
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.220]   to promote this research.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.060]   And so if you see an industry white paper out there that's --
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.260]   this paper is presented by insurance company A, I'm the author.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.900]   Yes, I was probably paid something to do that.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.180]   Now, there are exceptions because I do occasionally see my name being used
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.820]   in ways I didn't even know about.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.180]   But probably, probably I was paid something to do that white paper.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.020]   So that does create a conflict.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.220]   Yes, you should be skeptical about it.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.580]   Now, one aspect of this research that's different from a lot
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.900]   of research, it's possible to make up data.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900]   And that's less possible with this.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.100]   Like, if you disagree with the conclusions of the paper,
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.740]   what I'm basically doing is math calculations.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.380]   I'm explaining the methodology.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.220]   I'm explaining all the assumptions.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.660]   So the only possibilities are there's a mistake in the calculations,
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.340]   which I always worry about.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.940]   I guess the conspiracy theorist would be there's intentional mistakes.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.060]   There could also be unintentional mistakes.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.180]   But I try very carefully to make sure that doesn't happen.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.780]   And then the other possibility is just a disagreement about assumptions.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.860]   And so I couldn't say to the average person on the street, well,
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.140]   it's okay because you can just recreate the analysis on your own.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.300]   I think I can say that to the boogleheads community.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.140]   There's a lot of members of boogleheads who are much more technically sound
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.540]   than I am.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.260]   I'm pretty much self-taught at computer programming.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.340]   That wasn't my specific background.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.220]   And you have, like, the variable withdrawal percentage method
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.820]   at boogleheads.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.900]   It goes really deep into the weeds.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.260]   So there are boogleheads that could take my research, recreate it on their own,
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.020]   and if they find a problem with it, report that to the wider community.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.980]   So that's generally how I would suggest dealing with the potential conflicts
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.660]   of interest because, yes, it exists.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.260]   Now, I do turn down things.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.380]   Whenever, multiple times in my life, I've turned down the opportunity
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.660]   to write white paper because I didn't think I could write something
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.580]   that the company would be able to use.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.940]   But if it's something that aligns with this general concept that, yes,
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.860]   I really do believe annuities can work better than bonds
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.300]   in a retirement portfolio, then I feel comfortable doing that.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.780]   And that's how I try to manage it.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.860]   And that's where, with this research, I do think it's a little bit different
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.660]   because you can't just simply make up the data.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.260]   There's the ability to look at the analysis,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.060]   recreate it, and see if I've made a mistake.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.820]   I have worked with Alan Roth on two occasions
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.340]   where he's had me a different set of assumptions.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.780]   I've run it for him.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.660]   He's written an article for it.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.540]   I do try to use unbiased assumptions.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.460]   But he wants to say, well, what if you're truly a booglehead
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.340]   where there's no investment fees or anything else like that?
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.740]   And then we get to conclusions.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.540]   I think we have a little bit different interpretation of them.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.860]   He tends to think that, okay,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.540]   this completely overturned anything I'd done.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.060]   I tend to think that, no, if you really stack the deck in favor
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.900]   of investments as much as possible, it kind of comes out more even.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.620]   But nonetheless, that's kind of where we're at
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.300]   with how to think about the conflicts.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.580]   >> Okay. Nothing about conflicts.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.380]   Let's talk about retirement.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.340]   Let's talk just broadly, decumulation and accumulation.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.060]   After this session, the decumulators are going to be in here after lunch,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.100]   and the accumulators are going to be in the next room.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.660]   But can you explain broadly how the decumulation phase
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.620]   differs from the accumulation phase?
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.660]   >> Yes. So the accumulation phase,
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.100]   it of course could get a lot more complicated.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.460]   But the idea is like, it's what modern portfolio theory is all about.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.100]   You try to build a diversified portfolio
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.660]   that seeks the highest risk-adjusted return.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.940]   And then based on your risk tolerance
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.700]   or your ability to stomach short-term market volatility,
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.300]   you're trying to find that right mix of stocks and bonds
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.860]   and other potential asset classes on the efficient frontier.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.140]   Now, modern portfolio theory, that's an assets-only concept.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.180]   It's just, how do you choose a portfolio seeking risk-adjusted return?
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.380]   And it's a single time period model.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.260]   It can be used as an approximation
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.780]   of the household's investing problem pre-retirement.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.220]   But post-retirement, what makes retirement different?
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.380]   You can't really treat it as an assets-only accumulation problem anymore.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.740]   You have to treat it as an asset liability matching problem.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.020]   I have to fund expenditures from my assets.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.380]   That's going to change how things work.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.420]   This is where the sequence of returns risk idea becomes more important.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.740]   This is where then in the context of households,
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.700]   longevity becomes important.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.660]   We don't know how long we're going to live.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.660]   And so this is how I basically explain how retirement's different.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.340]   Longevity risk becomes this overarching risk of retirement.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.700]   Because we don't know how long we have to make the plan last for.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.900]   In an investments-only world, you can't pool the longevity risk on your own.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.500]   You have to assume some sort of long time horizon.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.300]   That's the logic of the 4% rule.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.740]   Originally, the idea was, if you had a 65-year-old couple,
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.500]   it's unlikely that either person would live past 95.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.060]   That was meant to be a conservative planning age.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.060]   Let's make sure the plan works for at least 30 years.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.140]   That's how you can approach it in an investments-only world.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.740]   Or you can bring actuarial risk pooling into that as well,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.100]   where you have the ability to-- the aggregated pool.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.580]   We don't know who's going to live the longest in that pool, who's not
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.740]   going to live very long in that pool.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.540]   But we can start to use the idea that there's a distribution of longevity.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.700]   And so we can plan to have a payout link closer to someone's life expectancy,
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.700]   rather than having to worry that they may live an extremely long time.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.420]   But that longevity risk becomes an overarching risk of retirement.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.300]   Because the longer somebody lives, the more expensive
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.740]   their retirement becomes.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.740]   Every year of retirement is another year of expenditures
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.800]   that they need to fund.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.540]   And then with a longer retirement, there's
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.140]   the other risks, the macroeconomic and market volatility,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.100]   the sequence of returns, which Dana talked about very well yesterday.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.300]   And I'm sure it may come up in other contexts.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.100]   So I need to give the full story about it.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.540]   But it's the idea that, if the market's down
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.100]   and you have to sell assets to fund an expenditure need,
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.980]   even if the market recovers, your portfolio
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.180]   doesn't get to enjoy the full recovery.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.060]   So you're more exposed to market volatility
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.860]   when you're taking distributions from the portfolio.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.060]   And you have to manage inflation.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.700]   To the extent that our liability grows with inflation,
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.740]   we do have to be concerned about inflation.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.100]   That's another difference from modern portfolio theory,
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.340]   where the risk-free asset is treated as a short-term treasury bill.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.940]   That's not a risk-free asset when you're trying to fund a liability that
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.180]   may or may not--
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.060]   especially that may grow with inflation in retirement.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.900]   And then you have personal spending shocks.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.700]   So we've thought about, well, what's our budget for retirement?
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.520]   But then there's all these potential additional expenses
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.300]   that we haven't necessarily built into the budget--
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.140]   long-term care, major health bills, and so forth.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.860]   And so we also have to think about, well,
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.180]   how are we going to manage reserves to not only meet our baseline spending
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.460]   needs, but also anticipate the possibility--
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.780]   and not the absolute certainty, but the possibility
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.660]   that we may have other large expenditures to face as well.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.060]   Thank you for that broad overview of how
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.580]   investing and managing your money in retirement
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.460]   is different once you're living off the assets.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.460]   You've talked before about retirement income styles.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.540]   What are the various retirement income styles?
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.060]   Yeah, and this-- so this is really an evolution of--
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.300]   I don't know if you can see those are the colors I chose.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.940]   But an evolution of the idea of there's these two schools of thought
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.540]   for retirement income.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.380]   So let's take a tour of what these styles are.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.100]   And then we can talk a little bit more about how we can think about them
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.380]   and what characteristics do they have.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.500]   So in the upper right is total returns.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.100]   Now, these styles do have other names.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.220]   This is also called systematic withdrawals or SWIPS.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.180]   This is the world of the 4% rule as a starting point.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.140]   It's the idea of you build a diversified portfolio
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.820]   and take distributions from that portfolio in a systematic manner
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.060]   throughout retirement.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.060]   And that's all you need to worry about is, well,
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.260]   let's just manage this portfolio and take distributions.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.380]   So that's one of the core strategies, total returns,
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.140]   systematic withdrawals.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.100]   The lower left will be the other core strategy.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.300]   This I call income protection.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.540]   It has other names as well.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.260]   It can be called the flooring approach.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.220]   It can be called essential versus discretionary.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.940]   The idea with income protection is before you start investing,
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.060]   you want to make sure you have your basics covered.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.580]   Now, that includes Social Security.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.100]   That includes pensions.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.660]   But if there's still a gap where you feel like you'd really
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.020]   like to have more reliable income to cover some basic expenditures,
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.100]   you might look to lifetime income annuities
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.100]   to provide that lifetime income protection to cover the basics.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.300]   Then you can invest on top of that for more discretionary types of goals.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.060]   So total return, income protection are going
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.100]   to be the two core strategies.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.380]   And then we have two behavioral strategies.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.340]   And I just call them that because their motivation was more behavioral.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.820]   Starting in the upper left, this is time segmentation or also bucketing.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.340]   Dana talked about it in a really effective manner yesterday.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.220]   I think of asset dedication that she was talking about
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.180]   as the best real world implementation of theory behind time segmentation.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.740]   Because if you ask 100 different people what time segmentation means,
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   you will get 100 different answers.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.100]   And a lot of those answers don't really have any true systematic
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.420]   underlying ability to test when do you extend the ladder and so forth.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.220]   But the idea of time segmentation is we don't just invest for total returns.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.140]   We invest differently based on the time horizon.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.780]   Bonds are fixed income.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:54.380]   So we use them to cover our fixed income expenses over the short term.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.540]   Stocks are meant to provide growth.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.180]   So we build this long term growth portfolio or growth bucket.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.180]   And we allow those stocks to grow.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.220]   And then we don't necessarily have to touch them for however many years
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.580]   with the idea that if there's a market downturn,
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.780]   the stocks will recover before we're forced to sell from the stock portfolio.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.740]   So it's really a different way to frame the portfolio.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.220]   If I have a 60/40 asset allocation stocks and bonds in a total return
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:25.100]   environment, I'm 60% stocks, 40% constant duration bond funds.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.180]   In the time segmentation environment, maybe I'm 40% bonds
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.660]   because it took 40% of my assets to build a 10-year front end bond ladder.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.100]   And then the rest of my money can just go in stocks at that point.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.500]   And so the 60% stocks is what I'm using earmarked to cover expenses
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.700]   beyond that 10-year bond ladder that I created.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.900]   And then finally, in the lower right, this is risk graph.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.540]   And the idea here, this one will make a little more sense
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.100]   after talking about the factors that lead to these styles.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.220]   But there's a sense of being comfortable with the market here,
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.380]   but also wanting some sort of guardrail behind that market risk
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.700]   that you're taking.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.420]   And in terms of behavioral solutions, this
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.300]   would be the whole motivation behind a variable annuity
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.580]   with a lifetime income benefit.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.980]   Behaviorally, you can still invest for upside,
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.980]   but you have a put option on the stock market.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.860]   If the market goes down, there is a downside level
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.260]   of spending that that asset base will cover for your lifetime,
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.420]   no matter what happens in the financial markets.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.540]   So I can still invest for upside.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.140]   Now, I don't get the full upside because there's going to be fees,
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.540]   but I can still invest for upside and have a downside protection.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.300]   And I think that's the most practical way
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.460]   to describe the philosophy behind risk graph,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.660]   that it's seeking market growth, but in one sort of financial
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.900]   product, because that's where it's behavioral.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.380]   You could do the same thing with stocks and SPIAs,
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.180]   but behaviorally, with one financial product,
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.700]   seeking upside growth, but still having some sort of floor
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.500]   downside spending protection at the same time.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.740]   So let's pause right there.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.260]   You'll see Rick Ferry walking around collecting questions.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.700]   Depending on how loquacious Wade happens
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.420]   to be during this discussion, we'll
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.620]   see how many of those questions we get to at the end.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.460]   But Rick will be collecting those.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.500]   If it's like most sessions, we won't get to most of them.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.900]   But Wade will be around for the rest of the conference
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.140]   to take those questions on a personal matter.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.060]   You alluded to factors that--
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.740]   and really, what we're talking about is,
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.940]   how does someone decide which of these models they should use?
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.380]   So like I was saying before, most of the research I do
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.140]   is writing computer programs to simulate strategies,
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.060]   and then it's just calculations based on assumptions.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.780]   This is different.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.980]   I worked with a PhD in psychology
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.660]   to do this research, creating a questionnaire,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.220]   looking for-- reading everything we could on retirement income,
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.860]   written for consumers, written for advisors,
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.180]   looking for trade-offs.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.740]   Where do people have to make some sort of decision,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.380]   writing questions around that, and then
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.820]   providing these questions to people
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.480]   who were willing to participate in answering?
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.980]   Initially, we had 900 questions.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.300]   No one was asked to answer 900 questions.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.580]   But we whittled it down to, at the end of the day,
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.300]   what I'm about to talk about is really 12 questions can tease
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.460]   that out.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.580]   But at one point, we had nine different factors.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.660]   And then we use exploratory factor analysis,
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.500]   which is a statistical technique that sort of clumps questions
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.780]   together to see what sort of questions
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.940]   seem to work together to provide some sort
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.340]   of distinct explanation about how
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.140]   people think about retirement.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.700]   From that, we came down to two primary factors.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.820]   And that's what I'll explain now.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.820]   There's four secondary factors that I
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.540]   won't go through in detail.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.620]   They help to further tell the story.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.080]   And I think bogo heads, in general,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.340]   may be more interested.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.580]   But if you're just giving this to the average person,
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.340]   the two primary factors is really all you need.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.860]   And again, these two primary factors
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.460]   came out of this sort of statistical work
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.020]   of seeing how do the answers to different questions
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.180]   relate to each other in a way that
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.640]   builds some sort of distinct factor for how people are
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.740]   thinking about retirement income.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.820]   Now, the first of these is we call it probability-based
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.820]   versus safety-first.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.740]   That's the old name of what I called schools
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.460]   of thought for retirement income.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.980]   So it lives on.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.700]   And there's no right answer to this.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.580]   This is where it's your preferences.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.880]   Financial markets are uncertain.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.340]   How do you feel about this?
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.820]   There's no true correct answer here.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.340]   If you're probability-based, you're
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.700]   comfortable relying on the idea that stocks
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.260]   will outperform bonds in a manner
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.100]   that you can rely upon in your retirement
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.560]   so that with a diversified portfolio,
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.300]   you can fund your expenditure needs in retirement.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.740]   And fundamentally, you're OK with the idea of a 50% to 75%
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.140]   stock allocation in retirement because you
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.020]   feel like you can rely on that.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.820]   Now, we did do a study recently with BlackRock,
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.860]   which I just mentioned the name only because they
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.580]   are a financial institution, not an insurance company.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.380]   But one of the questions we asked them there was,
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.500]   what is your financial-- what is your forecast of the stock
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.220]   market over the next 10 years?
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.460]   It could be anywhere from less than 0%
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.500]   for the next 10 years per year, annualized, to more than 12%.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   Now, you might think probability-based
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.620]   is going to be more optimistic about the stock market.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.660]   That's not the case.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.640]   There's no relationship between what
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.660]   you think the stock market will do
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.260]   and whether you're probability-based or safety-first.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.820]   If you're probability-based, you may
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.980]   believe the stock market's going to only average 2% a year.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.780]   But you're still fundamentally comfortable
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.340]   relying on the market.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.260]   If you're safety-first, you might
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.620]   think the stock market's going to average 12% a year.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.180]   It doesn't make a difference.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.580]   But when it comes to funding your core spending
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.160]   need in retirement, you're not really comfortable relying
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.740]   on the stock market for that.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.380]   You'd rather have some sort of contractually protected income
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.900]   that, though it may not be truly 100% safe--
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.180]   that's got to be a caveat.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.340]   There's nothing that's 100% safe--
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.060]   it at least has a high degree of safety
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.720]   relative to uncertain financial market outcomes.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.780]   Now, that can mean holding individual bonds to maturity,
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.900]   or that can mean using risk pooling through insurance
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.660]   as an additional source of spending beyond bonds.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.940]   That actually can be competitive with the stock market.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.420]   And that's where either of these answers,
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.820]   they lead to viable strategies.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.980]   So it's really what somebody's most comfortable with.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.620]   Are you probability-based or safety-first?
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.860]   The other factor is optionality versus commitment.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.660]   How much optionality do you want for your asset base?
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.020]   If you're optionality-oriented, you really value flexibility
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.300]   above all else.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.180]   You want to be able to respond to new changes,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.340]   take advantage of new opportunities,
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.740]   just be flexible with your assets,
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.620]   keep all the liquidity you can for your assets.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.100]   You value that optionality.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.740]   Other people might answer more with a commitment orientation.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.420]   With a commitment orientation, you're
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.260]   saying that if you can find something that will solve
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.060]   for a lifetime need, you'd rather just lock it in
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.820]   and take it off your to-do list and not
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.420]   have to worry about that.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.220]   There's also nuances here with, this
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.980]   will help me manage cognitive decline potentially.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.800]   If I'm the person that manages the household finances,
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.300]   if I could commit to something that
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.720]   will protect other family members,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.140]   if I'm no longer capable of making
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.540]   the financial decisions, this is the idea
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.620]   of a commitment orientation.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.060]   So we've got these two factors.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.860]   And this was the big aha moment for me.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.980]   And the reason I had those displayed
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.180]   the way they were before is, what we do
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.700]   is make a matrix out of this.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.320]   Probability based on the right, safety first on the left,
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.740]   optionality on top, commitment on the bottom.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.620]   And again, this was the big aha for me.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.340]   This explains these retirement strategies
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.580]   that we've been talking about for years.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.860]   If your total returns, your probability-based,
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.980]   you're comfortable relying on the market
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.580]   and you're optionality-oriented, you
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.180]   want to maintain flexibility for your asset base.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.960]   And that's fine.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.780]   If you're income protection, you're safety first.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.620]   You want contractual protections to cover your basics.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.340]   And you have a commitment orientation.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.260]   You're comfortable committing to something that
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.040]   will solve your lifetime need.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.220]   Now, those are going to be the two core strategies,
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.540]   because there are correlations.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.700]   People who are probability-based are also
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.820]   likely to be more optionality-oriented.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.580]   People who are safety first also tend
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.340]   to be more commitment-oriented.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.020]   But then you get the two kind of hybrid or behavioral strategies
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.780]   too.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.360]   So time segmentation, you're safety first.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.300]   You want contractual protections,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.380]   but you also want optionality.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.840]   I think that evolved in the financial services world
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.500]   as you get the contractual protections
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.460]   through your short-term buckets, you
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.260]   get the optionality through your long-term buckets.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.140]   And then risk graph is you're probability-based.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.900]   You're comfortable relying on the market.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.460]   But you're also-- you like committing
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.780]   to something that can solve for the lifetime need.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.300]   Now, with the secondary factors that I didn't explain,
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.740]   when you're in the bottom half, you
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.980]   tend to also be more worried about outliving your money.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.420]   When you're in the top half, you're
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.220]   not as worried about outliving your money.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.460]   So there's a sense that even though with risk graph,
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.540]   you're comfortable with the markets,
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.340]   you still want guardrails or some sort
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.780]   of backstop or protections.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.980]   And you're comfortable committing to something
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.700]   that will help to solve for that problem.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.380]   So the big issue that everybody worries about,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.020]   sequence of returns risk.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.620]   Even though your returns are OK on average
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.780]   throughout retirement, if the crummy returns come first,
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.820]   it can sink your retirement ship.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.340]   What are the four broad ways to manage sequence of returns
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.640]   risk?
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.780]   Yes, so here's a comprehensive list
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.700]   of how to manage sequence risk.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.460]   Now, there's going to be subcategories.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.460]   But I think anything someone can name, I'm pretty sure,
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.460]   fits into one of these four.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.420]   So sequence risk is really, it's kind of like,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.620]   how do we manage volatility and then also
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.060]   longevity at the same time?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.520]   How do we build a plan that's going
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.500]   to be sustainable in retirement?
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.740]   The four broad options, one, spend conservatively.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.020]   That's the logic of the 4% rule.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.540]   It's build an aggressive portfolio.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.540]   But let's just figure out how low our spending
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.780]   has to go so that we don't have to worry
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.320]   about outliving our money.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.060]   It's not the most satisfying way to approach retirement.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.900]   It's also really a research simplification,
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.660]   because it assumes you don't have
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.980]   any sort of discretionary power to change your spending.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.140]   You always just adjust it for inflation.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.760]   But it's seeking to answer the question,
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.340]   how low does spending need to go to not run out of money?
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.860]   Now, sequence risk is triggered by selling assets at a loss.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.900]   So the other approaches are all about,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.660]   how can we better try to avoid selling assets at a loss?
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.420]   Spending flexibly is, if I can cut my spending when
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.280]   the markets are down however we define that--
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.240]   we can talk about that.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.940]   And Dana talked about some of the methods
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.020]   yesterday as well with time segmentation
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.860]   that apply to spending flexibility strategies
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.020]   in the same manner.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.180]   But when markets are somehow down,
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.980]   how can we adjust our spending downward
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.360]   to help avoid selling assets at the loss
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.500]   and to give our portfolio more opportunity to recover?
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.740]   So that's the core concept behind variable spending.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.380]   Then the third category, reduce volatility.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.700]   That doesn't mean simply using bonds in retirement,
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.260]   though now that the TIPS yield curve is at 2.4%,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.920]   maybe that is high enough to just fund your retirement
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.340]   with a 30-year bond letter.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.060]   But what we're talking about more with reduced volatility,
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.140]   it could be--
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.300]   well, this is a bucketing.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.800]   The bucketing idea is you reduce volatility in the short run
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.260]   for at least volatility that you're
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.260]   exposed to in the short run.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.220]   You could talk about annuities in this context.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.140]   In the total return context, Michael Kitsies and I
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.820]   wrote about the idea of a rising equity glide path in retirement
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.540]   where you have the lowest stock allocation at retirement
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.020]   when you're the most vulnerable to a market downturn,
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.380]   and then you gradually increase without retirement.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.960]   So different ideas around how you
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.240]   might reduce volatility at important moments
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.700]   in retirement.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.480]   And then the fourth approach is buffer assets.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.540]   So buffer assets are something outside your portfolio
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.640]   that you don't think of them as part of your portfolio,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.480]   and they're not correlated with their portfolio, which
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.680]   more generally just means buffer assets shouldn't
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.560]   be able to lose value.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.760]   And then you think of them as a temporary resource
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.520]   that you can spend from when you're-- again,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.900]   back to this idea that when your portfolio is in trouble
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.100]   or when the markets are down, however defined,
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.020]   I can draw from the buffer asset as a temporary spending
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.260]   resource so that I don't have to suffer my portfolio at a loss,
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.340]   and that will allow my portfolio an opportunity to recover.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.300]   And as a little teaser of what's coming up here.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.020]   So I'm only comfortable identifying three things
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.260]   as buffer assets.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.580]   The original buffer asset is cash.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.500]   You have a big pile of cash.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.360]   And you could think, well, is cash my short-term bucket?
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.260]   It could be cash as time segmentation if you've--
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.620]   it's really-- it's part of your spending strategy.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.080]   But if you're thinking of cash more
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.580]   as I've got a pile of cash, I don't
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.340]   think of it as part of my portfolio,
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.140]   I'll use it as a temporary spending resource
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.420]   when I need to.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.560]   That would be a cash reserve as a buffer asset.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.180]   The other two buffer assets out there
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.140]   that then don't require as big of cash holding
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.180]   are, where the tomatoes can begin,
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.940]   the growing line of credit on a reverse mortgage home equity
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.480]   conversion mortgage.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.540]   And that's something you can set up a requirement.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.620]   And then going even further back in time,
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.180]   if you had this, a whole life insurance policy,
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.220]   the cash value of whole life insurance
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.260]   can play a similar role where you take proceeds
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.600]   as a loan from either the cash value or the reverse mortgage.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.300]   And that becomes a temporary spending resource
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.180]   to get you through a market downturn.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.900]   And we'll talk more about that.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.060]   Oh, yes, we will.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.900]   So that's the teaser.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.500]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.060]   The 4% rule came out in the '90s from a handful of studies
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.820]   and was revolutionary in this space.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.900]   And yet, almost everybody in this space now agrees,
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.100]   that's a terrible way to fund your retirement.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.520]   And that almost everybody should be
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.180]   using some sort of a variable withdrawal strategy.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.900]   So why is that?
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.620]   And what's the 4% rule good for anyway?
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:49.340]   OK, so the 4% rule provided a really valuable contribution.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.620]   It introduced the idea of sequence risk
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.660]   to the financial planning world.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.140]   Because before the 4% rule, as I understand it,
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.660]   the article was published in 1994.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.940]   So I wasn't around doing research at that time.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.940]   But people were just using spreadsheets.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.260]   And they were saying things like, well, the stock market
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.020]   should average 7% after inflation.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.220]   I'll plug 7% in my spreadsheet.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.980]   7% is a safe withdrawal rate with 100% stock portfolio.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.780]   Because every year I get 7% returns.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.380]   I spend it.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.880]   I'm never going to even tip it in my principal.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.620]   I could even maybe spend 8% and slowly spend on my principal.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.580]   Bill Bingen recognized that was ridiculous.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.300]   And so he looked at the historical data
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.740]   to try to figure out, well, given that markets are
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.660]   volatile, even if the stock market averages 7%,
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.540]   that's approximately the S&P 500's real return compounded.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.380]   What do you do about the market volatility?
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.900]   And so he explored that with US historical data
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.860]   and figured out if you retired in 1966 with a 50/50 portfolio,
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.980]   4% was as much as you could have spent in the first year
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.660]   that if you then increased that for inflation growth,
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.460]   your money would have run out precisely 30 years later.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.940]   And so that was his safe max.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.860]   That was a maximum spending rate you
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.020]   could have safely used in the worst case 30 year
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.740]   period from US history.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.820]   So that's a helpful guideline.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.100]   But it's not really a real-world spending strategy
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.420]   because it has so many assumptions baked into it.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.300]   It ignores taxes.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.020]   It ignores the idea of investment fees,
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.740]   though I guess if you're VTI, you
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.660]   don't have to worry about that angle.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.980]   But it's really a simplified investment strategy.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.540]   S&P 500, intermediate-term government bonds,
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.740]   which might be a reason you could go higher than 4%
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.740]   with a more diversified portfolio,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.260]   said it ignores taxes.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:33.820]   What else?
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.820]   I mean, 30 years is a retirement horizon, 50% to 75% stocks.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.820]   You're always rebalancing to the asset allocation
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.420]   that you've targeted.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.420]   And well, there you go.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.940]   That's the idea behind the 4% rule.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.460]   And you never deviate from the idea
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.660]   that you just increase your spending for inflation.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.260]   Now, I mentioned this idea that if you
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.740]   can be flexible with your spending,
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.900]   you can potentially start with something much higher than 4%.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.780]   But 4% kind of worked itself into the zeitgeist
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.940]   is here is the basic rule of thumb
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.340]   about how much you can spend in retirement.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:12.420]   There's a lot of information on that slide.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.460]   Yeah, this has a lot of--
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.460]   How much time are we going to spend on this slide?
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.380]   So this is about the variable spending strategies.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.740]   And so what we're looking at here is--
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.940]   and it all depends on capital market assumptions.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.940]   This one was run at the beginning of the year
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.380]   when the TIPS yield was about 1.75%.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.900]   If I reran this today, the 4% rule is going to work now.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.860]   We've got real yields that are well--
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.460]   now, there is a--
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.180]   some Boglehead forum members have this idea
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.220]   that if the TIPS yield curve can support 4%,
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.220]   that's a guarantee that the 4% rule is safe.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.660]   I disagree with that because the 4% rule does not
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.900]   assume a 30-year TIPS ladder.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.180]   It assumes a portfolio of 50% to 75% stocks.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.940]   However, there is a correlation.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.660]   As interest rates come up, I would
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.620]   agree that the probability that the 4% rule will work
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.300]   comes up accordingly.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.900]   So if I did rerun this today, 4% would be there.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.740]   Now, what this is looking at is inflation-adjusted amounts
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.620]   at the top.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.140]   That's the 4% rule concept.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.220]   That's every year you're spending growths for inflation.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.300]   And then with the capital market assumptions in the article,
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.540]   we're just looking at, well, what's the highest spending
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.060]   rate you could use?
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.100]   And we're calibrating downside risk.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.340]   As soon as you start talking about variable strategies,
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.820]   you can't use a failure rate idea
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.580]   that the 4% rule usually uses because some variable spending
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.620]   strategies, you can never run out of money.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.260]   So it doesn't make any sense to talk about that.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.180]   So I use something I call the pay rule, which
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.460]   is my downside risk calibration.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.140]   What probability do you accept that your remaining wealth
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.180]   will drop below a particular threshold
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.020]   by a certain year of retirement?
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.500]   So here, I accept a 10% probability.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.900]   And this is all just scaled on $100 at retirement.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.820]   So that my remaining real wealth,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.180]   inflation-adjusted wealth, 10% probability
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.900]   that my real wealth drops below $10 by year 30--
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.900]   I think year 30 of retirement.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.020]   With the inflation-adjusted spending strategy,
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.340]   it's a 3.62% withdrawal rate.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.900]   Now, one time, when the Boca heads were talking about this,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.740]   they were, oh, I always have all these conflicts.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.460]   I changed the failure rate measure.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.060]   So I'm just showing, if you use a traditional failure rate
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.260]   measure, this would actually be 3.83%.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.820]   You just can't use that when you're
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.900]   comparing variable spending strategies.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.480]   But then we just have different variable spending strategies.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.620]   If you use a fixed percent of what's left every year,
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.660]   8 and 1/2% is the withdrawal rate.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.940]   And that's what you get that calibrates so that there's
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.980]   a 10% chance that you only have $10 left after 30 years.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.380]   Again, that's 10% of what you started with after 30 years.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.060]   There is the Bengen dollar floor and ceiling rule,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.060]   where you could start with a 4.14%.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.180]   And you spend a percentage of what's left every year,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.500]   4.14% of what's left every year.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.300]   But if your wealth is growing, that number
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.700]   is going to start giving you more spending power.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.900]   You apply a dollar ceiling that you're not
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.820]   going to spend more than that ceiling.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.140]   And also, if your portfolio is declining,
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.380]   4.14% of what's left is going to decrease your spending.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.780]   You apply a dollar floor, you won't let your spending drop
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.620]   below a particular dollar threshold.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.700]   And so you have variable spending within a range,
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.180]   but there's a ceiling and a floor on that.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.840]   Gets you a higher spending rate.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.380]   You've got the ratcheting rule, which
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.780]   is based on something Michael Kitsie has talked about.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.540]   And these are all inspired by whatever
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.380]   Michael Kitsie's blog post was.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.660]   He had a different way to explain the ratcheting rule.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.980]   I just apply it as 3.59% is your floor.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.180]   If your wealth drops so that when you take 3.59% of what's
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.980]   left, it would be less than the $3.59 real
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.380]   that you start with, then it's constant inflation
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.160]   adjusted spending at that amount.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.580]   If the portfolio is growing so that 3.59% of what's left
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.620]   is more, you get to spend more.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.460]   So it's basically unlimited upside on spending,
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.700]   but you're still putting in that floor.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.140]   The spending guardrail rule, that's
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.820]   kind of like what Jonathan Guyton talks
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.100]   about with his decision rules.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.860]   You've got the prosperity rule.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.260]   You've got the capital preservation rule.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.340]   How the spending guardrail rule works
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.300]   is you could take 4.53% of your initial balance,
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.340]   increase that for inflation.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:25.240]   But the prosperity rule says that if your portfolio is
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.140]   growing, that spending amount is going
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.700]   to be a smaller percentage of what's left.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.300]   The prosperity rule says you're never
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.600]   going to spend less than a certain percentage of what's
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.900]   left so that your spending can grow more than inflation
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.900]   adjusted.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.980]   If your portfolio is doing well, the capital preservation rule
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.420]   goes in the other direction.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.080]   You're spending that amount every year,
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.540]   but if your portfolio is declining,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.140]   eventually your withdrawal rate based on what's left
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.580]   is getting too high, so you apply this rule.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.940]   I'm not going to spend more than this percent of what's
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.980]   left in my portfolio.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.720]   The inflation rule is, it's like that glide path idea
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.260]   that Dana was talking about yesterday,
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.260]   but if you have more wealth than the glide path,
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.140]   you take the inflation adjustment.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.300]   If your wealth has fallen below the glide path,
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.220]   you don't take the inflation adjustment.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.540]   And so that allows for a dramatically higher initial
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.540]   spending rate, but with this built-in ability
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.660]   that your spending may decline over time.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.620]   And then the modified R&D rule is, take the R&D tables,
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.620]   multiply them by the factor that will calibrate that downside
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:30.700]   risk measure, which leads to at age 65, or I think age 65--
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.260]   this is not the R&D factor that you get from that age,
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.060]   but when you multiply it by, in this case, 1.56,
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.260]   you could start with a 4.25% withdrawal rate,
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.220]   and then it's calibrated to the R&D. So as you age,
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.220]   you can spend an increasing percentage of what's left.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.620]   And in terms of just what do we get with that,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.000]   I think that table, when you start looking at the numbers,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.460]   it's going to become pretty apparent
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.780]   that you have a lot of flexibility about which way
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.600]   to go, but you probably don't want
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.180]   to use the inflation-adjusted spending amount strategy.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.040]   It starts at a much lower level of spending,
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.200]   and it really doesn't have a whole lot going for it,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.580]   other than because you usually underspend with it,
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.900]   you might leave a lot of legacy.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.260]   So if you really value legacy, inflation-adjusted amounts
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.100]   might be an option.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.740]   The fixed-percentage rule, start with a much higher
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.740]   initial spending, but you can really
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.000]   expect your spending to decrease over time.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.200]   And it's really efficient at spending on your assets,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.300]   so you're not going to be leaving as much legacy.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.100]   The dollar-floor-ceiling rule is one
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.900]   of my personal favorites of these.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.780]   It's a nice compromise about get a higher initial spending
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.500]   rate, and your spending stays in a more steady range.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.620]   The ratcheting rule, it's just pretty much--
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.040]   the ratcheting rule, although the initial withdrawal rate
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.140]   was slightly less than constant inflation-adjusted amounts,
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.580]   I'd almost say that it stochastically
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.360]   dominates constant inflation-adjusted spending.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.340]   You're pretty much the same or better off
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.400]   with the ratcheting rule.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.900]   So if anything, use the ratcheting rule instead
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.220]   of inflation-adjusted spending.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.340]   The ceiling doesn't matter.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.540]   It's the floor that matters.
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.300]   And that's having that floor, but then
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.820]   being able to go above the floor.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.820]   It's just, why not do that?
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.140]   Compared to the 4% rule concept of always increasing
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.780]   spending for inflation.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.100]   Spending guardrails is harder to implement in practice,
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.020]   and I don't think that's fully appreciated.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.720]   The Jonathan Geichen spending guardrail rules
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.660]   are probably the hardest of any of these rules to actually use.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.420]   They do allow for higher initial spending,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.220]   and if you like building spreadsheets,
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.060]   could be the right one for you.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.100]   The inflation rule does provide guidance.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.060]   A lot of times, you have the question,
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.580]   when should I cut my spending?
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.660]   What has to happen to make a cut?
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.740]   Well, here, it's a nice kind of rule
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   around when I should not increase for inflation.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.940]   And then the modified R&D rules, though it's not
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.060]   the true academically optimal, because you really
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.340]   need to go a little bit deeper.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.020]   But it's closer to the idea that as you age,
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.020]   you should spend an increasing percentage of what's left.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.380]   And so if you don't have big legacy concerns,
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.300]   something like a modified R&D rule,
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.220]   it's going to give you more variable spending,
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.940]   but it's closer to the, quote unquote,
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.820]   most efficient way to spend on your assets and retirement.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.060]   So if your mom comes to you and asks you, which of these
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.220]   should I use, what's your answer?
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.940]   Well, and then in the real world,
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.900]   is you just spend what you need to spend,
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.220]   and it's not going to match any of these rules precisely.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.540]   That sounds like the Taylor-Laramore adjust
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.060]   as you go rule.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.560]   Right.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.060]   All right.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.980]   In the interest of time, I want to skip ahead
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.860]   to one of the controversial topics.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.460]   Let's talk for a minute about annuities.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.900]   And I want to talk a little bit about what annuities maybe
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.900]   people should consider, but also a question from the audience
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.300]   about SPIAs, which I'm sure you'll mention,
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.480]   a single premium immediate annuity,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.220]   that for a very long-term retirement,
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.580]   how do you best mitigate the impact of inflation
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.420]   on the SPIA, if you can cover that as well.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.860]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.500]   OK, yeah, let's go ahead and get to it.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.060]   So who might consider an annuity?
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.940]   And then we'll talk about inflation, too.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.100]   So who might consider an annuity?
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.820]   If your retirement income style is either income protection
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.860]   or risk-wrap, that's going to be something that's
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.220]   on the plate at that point.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.220]   If you're total returns, you're not even
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.260]   thinking about annuities.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.820]   That's where a lot of the opposition to annuities--
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.180]   I think some of the most vocal members at the forums,
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.180]   I would call total returns absolutists.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.720]   And they don't need an annuity.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.540]   It's not for them.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.980]   It's not part of their style.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.020]   It's not part of their preferences.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.300]   But if your style is income protection or risk-wrap,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.340]   it might be something to consider.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.300]   Also, do you have an income gap?
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.060]   So step one is always delay Social Security.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.180]   The delay credits on Social Security
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.940]   are much better than any sort of commercial annuity.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.060]   So delay Social Security to age 70.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.020]   Get your inflation-adjusted lifetime spending
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.440]   from Social Security with a survivor benefit.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.900]   If you have other pensions, other reliable income--
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.940]   and then it's only if there's a gap where you really
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.460]   would like to have more reliable income than is already
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.540]   available to you, you might be thinking
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.260]   about filling that gap with an income annuity.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.140]   Then you can feel more comfortable investing
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.660]   on top of that for discretionary goals.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.300]   If you have a low risk tolerance--
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.460]   and this becomes a big issue.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.060]   I never talk about annuities as a stock replacement.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.900]   They're a bond replacement.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.860]   So to the extent that you're not going to have stocks anyway,
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.380]   if you're very risk-averse, the case
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.340]   becomes stronger and stronger for the annuity
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.180]   because bonds aren't doing anything for you.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.540]   It's really the challenges you want
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.460]   risk pulling through the annuity or the risk premium
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.460]   through the stock market.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.920]   Well, if you're not going for the risk premium
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.660]   through the stock market, then you've
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.540]   got a stronger case for annuities.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.220]   If you're more worried about outliving your money, what
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.780]   that means in this context, in an investments-only world,
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.900]   it means you're going to be worried about spending.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.620]   So you're going to spend less and less.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.660]   This gets into the idea of the annuity provides you
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.780]   permission to spend because you're not worried
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.460]   about outliving that asset.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.140]   So to the extent that you're more
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.740]   worried about outliving your money,
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.980]   the case becomes stronger for the annuity.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.100]   Again, emphasize this important point.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.540]   If you're willing to view annuities
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.500]   as a bond replacement, which means
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.100]   for your remaining investments, you'll
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.580]   then have a higher stock allocation.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.340]   That's an important aspect of at least getting the math
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.660]   to work out that this is a good way to approach things.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.900]   If you like that idea of the commitment and the dementia
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.860]   insurance aspect of this is going
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.100]   to protect me from making mistakes later in life,
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.940]   this is going to be more helpful in preventing
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.300]   against financial fraud or elderly abuse
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.780]   because I don't have this big lump sum there that somebody
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.460]   can go after.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.540]   I've got a monthly income coming in.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.260]   Of course, you can still have fraud on a monthly paycheck,
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.340]   but it's harder to do that on a systematic basis
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.140]   than to go after one big lump sum.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.420]   And then also, you do need to make sure to take the time
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.380]   to understand how annuities work.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.180]   OK, now the inflation question is an important one.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.020]   So you do get inflation-adjusted income
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.820]   through Social Security.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.300]   You're not going to look to the annuity for inflation
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.420]   protection.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.620]   That's not what it does.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.900]   Your inflation protection can be through the TIPS.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.000]   It can be through stocks.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.740]   You mentioned real estate, which I usually
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.740]   didn't think to mention.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.020]   But maybe real estate is another option.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.220]   It's not the annuity.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:17.180]   But what the annuity does as a bond replacement is--
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.500]   so TIPS is another option.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.100]   But if we're just setting TIPS aside for the moment
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.220]   because it's like, do I want traditional treasuries
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.820]   or annuities, what annuities do relative
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.300]   to traditional treasuries is, over time, as you live longer,
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.900]   they meet more and more of your spending need
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.260]   so that you can take less distributions
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.520]   from your other assets.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.460]   And a big way to manage sequence risk
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.500]   is to reduce the spending.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.060]   Now, what you're doing there is you're
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.820]   reducing the spending from the investments
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.180]   because your annuity is covering more of that income over time.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.100]   That makes it easier for your stocks
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.540]   to grow if you're taking less distributions from the stocks.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.340]   So the annuity itself does not provide inflation protection.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.780]   But it makes it easier for your other investments
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.780]   to not be as burdened by distributions
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.340]   to allow them to be the source of inflation protection.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.960]   Now, they do have the responsibility.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.340]   If you need the inflation growth,
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.100]   that's coming from the investment side.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.220]   So your investments will be more burdened over time.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.220]   But this is back to when I do simulations around this,
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.980]   usually by having a lower distribution
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.260]   need from the investments.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.020]   You're building the framework for them
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.380]   to grow so that they can be that source of inflation
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.420]   more effectively in the future.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.660]   So it's not that the annuity by itself
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.260]   provides any sort of inflation protection.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.700]   What it does is it makes it easier for your investment
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.820]   portfolio to not be as burdened by distributions
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.860]   and therefore make it easier for them to provide
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.540]   the inflation protection.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.380]   Let's talk about the controversial buffer assets.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.220]   The first one, few people dislike
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.420]   how whole life insurance is sold more than I do,
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.140]   although I recognize there are times when it can be useful.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.220]   Do you think a typical investor, maybe even a typical Vogel
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.660]   head in this room, should consider purchasing a policy
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.820]   to help pay for their retirement?
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.060]   Yeah, the answer to that is probably not.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.860]   And I somehow have been labeled as this life insurance guy,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.860]   which I did a couple of studies about it in the past.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.740]   I'm not living my life thinking about life insurance every day.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.940]   But I did.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.180]   I became convinced enough--
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.560]   I'm still a little bit young to be purchasing annuities,
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.620]   but I did get a whole life policy
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.300]   after doing that research.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.860]   Because my bonds are--
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.260]   I don't have a lot of bonds.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.460]   I don't really want a high bond allocation right now.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.140]   I've got some high bonds, and then I
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.780]   have my whole life policy.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:41.980]   I don't have any other bonds.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.300]   I'm comfortable thinking of that as my bond allocation.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.540]   Now, after the tax deferral, I don't
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.940]   spend a lot of time thinking about bonds more generally.
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.380]   So I don't know if it's the best way to invest in bonds or not.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.860]   I think the case is there that I can be comfortable,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.980]   assuming I'm not being ripped off by treating it
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.460]   as my bond allocation.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.460]   But that's not going to be for everyone.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.380]   And in particular, it requires a very strong commitment
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.020]   orientation.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.580]   You're really making a lifetime commitment
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.260]   to a whole life insurance policy.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.380]   You don't want to necessarily lapse on that in the future.
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.140]   I feel like I could make that lifetime commitment to it.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.900]   So I feel like it's OK for me in that context.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.540]   And then, as part of retirement income, well,
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.300]   then how do you use it?
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.260]   Of course, the idea behind buy term and invest a difference,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.300]   you don't need life insurance in retirement.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.620]   You only need it to protect your family while you're working.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.060]   So if you're not working, you don't
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.480]   have any human capital to protect.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.260]   You don't need life insurance anymore.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:43.300]   Well, if you have a legacy goal in mind,
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.620]   rather than trying to spend less from your investments,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.180]   because you want to make sure you preserve that legacy goal,
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.260]   it can work to just earmark some of your potential investments
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.940]   to that life insurance policy instead to earmark,
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:54.820]   here's the legacy.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.660]   And the cost of that legacy was the premiums
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.700]   on the life insurance, not I just
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.060]   have to manage my investments more carefully
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.700]   to preserve the legacy.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.700]   Or this idea of, if you're income protection,
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.700]   it can be hard to purchase an income annuity.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.420]   And in particular, if you're in a couple,
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.500]   you get a joint life or a single life that would pay more.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.160]   Well, the idea behind the life insurance
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.140]   there is, if I have a life insurance policy,
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.500]   I could buy a life only income annuity, which
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.300]   is the highest paying possible income annuity,
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.260]   up to the amount of the death benefit on the life insurance.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.000]   Because I know that when I pass away,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.220]   the life insurance death benefit replaces
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.860]   that asset for the household.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.700]   And then if there is a surviving spouse at that point,
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.460]   they could use the death benefit to buy an annuity
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.340]   or whatever they want to do at that point.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.940]   But that's one way to think about it.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.580]   The other is this buffer asset idea
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.580]   that it's worth getting into a little deeper.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   Because this is also the--
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.100]   when I was learning about this stuff,
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.940]   there's a parallel conversation that
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.900]   was happening in the life insurance world
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.540]   and the reverse mortgage world.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.740]   This idea of this thing, this loan
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.260]   from something that doesn't decline in value
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.420]   is a buffer asset.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.060]   So it's worth talking about that a little bit more detail
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.740]   with another slide.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.340]   Another important aspect of this, like I was saying,
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.740]   this is not a replacement for your stock investments.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.780]   And I think a lot of the opposition to whole life
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.940]   is, you'd be better off in the stock market.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.540]   I'm really thinking of this as a bond replacement, not
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.060]   a stock replacement.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.780]   And also, if you're going to face higher tax
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.100]   rates in retirement, when the policy is structured properly,
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.260]   this can be a way to have, just like a Roth IRA,
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.780]   a source of spending power that does not
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.900]   add to your adjusted gross income
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.900]   and does not cause all the other problems.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.700]   So if you were at the session yesterday,
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.980]   it's worth just reviewing this idea real quick.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.580]   Are you going to be in a high tax bracket in retirement?
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.120]   Well, that question doesn't just mean the federal income tax
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.620]   bracket.
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.820]   It means all these other non-linear aspects
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.300]   of the tax code.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.020]   So there's no state income tax on this.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.580]   This is purely federal considerations.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.540]   If you're married, filing jointly in 2023,
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.260]   and at this point, the couple has $52,200 in Social Security,
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.340]   seems like a weird number.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.660]   It's basically a $2,500 primary insurance amount linked
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.940]   to a worker claiming at 70, and then also their spouse
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.820]   getting 50% of their full retirement amount.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.420]   And then preferential income of $20,000,
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.340]   that's qualified dividends, long-term capital gains
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.260]   that they're taking out of the portfolio.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.100]   Then we're going to look at the relationship
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.180]   between ordinary income, whether that's wages,
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.460]   whether that's an IRA distribution needed
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.020]   for spending, whether that's a Roth conversion.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.980]   But what happens to my taxes as I
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.540]   generate more ordinary income?
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.940]   Oh, are we at time?
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.100]   We're getting pretty close.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.600]   OK.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.820]   Sorry.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.140]   I was really wordy.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.820]   So it's basically then--
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.060]   what you're seeing here-- let me just explain this map,
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.360]   and then we can pretty much wrap up.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.940]   So it's jumping to 18 and 1/2% because you're
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.980]   in the 10% bracket at a point where you're then--
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.900]   each dollar is causing $0.85 of Social Security to be taxed.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.820]   Then you jump to 22.2% because you're in the 12% bracket.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.700]   Each dollar is causing $0.85 of Social Security to be taxed.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:15.060]   Then once you get the full 85% of your Social Security is taxed,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.420]   you drop back down to 12% for a while.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.060]   Then you jump up to 27% because that's
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.500]   where you're now pushing income from the long-term gains
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.620]   from 0% to 15%.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.100]   So you're riding along 27%.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.300]   Then for $200, you drop back down to the 22% bracket--
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.840]   no, I'm sorry, 12% bracket.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.740]   Then you're going to 22%.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.220]   Then you start getting hit by the IRMA thresholds.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.740]   And then also the 3.8% net investment income tax
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:48.300]   as you get closer to that $250,000 of taxable income.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.380]   That's close enough.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.780]   And so that's what you're needing
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.140]   to manage in retirement, not just federal income tax
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   brackets.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:58.820]   All right, let's take maybe one minute
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.340]   and just talk about that other controversial buffer
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.060]   asset of reverse mortgages.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.660]   I mean, I've got some neighbors who ran out of assets.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.140]   And the family decided, OK, the way
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.420]   we're going to pay for your last day
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.800]   is because they really want to stay in their home
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.300]   is a reverse mortgage.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.780]   Who should consider a reverse mortgage?
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.940]   So the idea here is this is the story for the intuition
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.940]   about why a buffer asset can work.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.260]   It's another way to manage sequence risk.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.540]   If you don't take a distribution from the portfolio,
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.860]   it allows your portfolio an easier chance to recover.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.020]   So if you took 34 distributions from the portfolio,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.340]   you end up at zero.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.220]   If you skipped one, you still have close to $1 million left.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.380]   If you skipped all three, and these are years after a big
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.780]   market downturn, you still have $2.25 million left.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.140]   So the idea with a buffer asset is
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.740]   if it costs less than $2.25 million
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.340]   to cover three years of spending from loans from my buffer
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:56.340]   asset, I can pay off the loan and still have a net windfall.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.220]   And that's where the story of reverse mortgage fits in.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.460]   It's another way-- it creates liquidity for the home
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.540]   without selling it.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.420]   And so just like if you spend from your IRA,
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.780]   that money's gone, well, this provides a way
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.940]   to spend from your home in a similar manner.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.100]   That's how I like to frame it.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.980]   Who should consider it?
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.540]   Someone who's not going to have the temptation
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.340]   to just spend it frivolously.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.900]   But if you're going to incorporate it
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.460]   into a responsible retirement income plan,
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.620]   and there's a lot of ways it can be done,
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.620]   it could have a potential role in the plan.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.660]   Well, I know lunch is waiting.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.700]   So I don't dare carry this on any longer.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.460]   There's a lot more interesting stuff about retirement income
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.360]   we can talk about.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.780]   But I think we better stop there,
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.580]   because I'm hearing some stomachs growling out there.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.140]   Just by way of information, lunch will be in the hallway.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.660]   You can take it into the other room.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.780]   There are lots of tables in there you can eat at.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.700]   I'm guessing this entire group is not going to fit in there.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.140]   So if a few of you need to come back to the tables in here,
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.100]   that's OK as well.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.780]   But thank you, Wade, for your expertise
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.620]   and sharing your thoughts on retirement.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.980]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.740]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
