[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Well, good morning, men, and Bob, thank you so much for leading us in those songs of praise
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.840]   to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.980]   I want to begin this morning just by expressing my gratitude to the Lord for all of you men.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.560]   It is an incredible encouragement to spend this week surrounded by such like-minded brothers,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.080]   surrounded by men who share a commitment to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, the authority
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.020]   of His Word, a commitment to the advancement of His gospel and the edification of His church.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.480]   And so, I just want to begin by saying thank you for your faithfulness.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.100]   It is a joy and a delight to open the Word of God for us this morning, and our text this
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:08.600]   morning is found in Mark chapter 2, Mark chapter 2, verses 1 to 17.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   In his commentary on this passage, John MacArthur begins with this probing question, "What is
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.900]   mankind's greatest problem?"
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.480]   What is mankind's greatest problem?
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.320]   And the obvious answer to that question, of course, is sin.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.360]   It is sin that has separated man from God, and it is on account of sin that man stands
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.720]   guilty before the law of God, condemned and rightly consigned to death, both in this life
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.260]   and in the next.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.120]   And yet, as Pastor John points out in his comments, mankind's greatest problem is not
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.880]   merely sin.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.720]   After all, those in heaven and those in hell, both heaven and hell, consist of people who
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.960]   were sinners in this life.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   The difference between those in heaven and those in hell is not that one group were sinners
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.240]   and the other group was not.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.420]   It is instead that those who are in heaven have had their sins forgiven, and those in
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.400]   hell have not.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:40.100]   And so, mankind's greatest problem is not merely sin, it is unforgiven sin.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.420]   And if mankind's greatest problem is unforgiven sin, then mankind's greatest need is for forgiveness.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.280]   It's for forgiveness.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.880]   Our theme of the conference this week is that truth triumphs, and my specific topic this
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.980]   morning is the triumph of divine pardon.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.380]   What I hope to show you from this text here in Mark chapter 2 is the reality that in the
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.420]   gospel through the person and work of Jesus Christ, that divine pardon triumphs over our
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.040]   desperate condition and our deserved condemnation.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.380]   That divine pardon triumphs over deserved punishment.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:39.820]   That the truth or the reality of our sinful depravity is overcome by the reality and truth
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:47.180]   of divine grace, the reality and truth of the gospel.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.660]   The power and necessity of forgiveness is such that where forgiveness is absent, no
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.540]   sinner, no matter how noble or seemingly moral, can ever earn the righteousness necessary
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.100]   to enter into heaven.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.300]   And yet, where divine forgiveness is bestowed by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, any
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.820]   sinner, no matter how wretched or worthless, can be pardoned, justified, given the hope
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.760]   of eternal life, and welcomed into the presence of God.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.900]   This is the triumph of divine pardon.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:44.300]   A couple months ago, I came across the story of a man named Henry Garricky.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.940]   You've probably never heard about him before, but he was a chaplain in the U.S. Army in
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.180]   World War II.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.780]   He was an evangelical Lutheran pastor, and he was in his mid-to-late forties when he
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.200]   was serving in the U.S. Army during that conflict.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.000]   And when the war ended, in part because he had experience working with prisoners of war,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.960]   and in part because he had studied German and spoke it fluently, he was asked by his
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.780]   commanding officers if he would be willing to serve as the chaplain for the Nazi war
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.520]   criminals who were to be tried at Nuremberg.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.420]   He was given time to consider whether or not he would take that assignment.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:44.280]   And as you might imagine, it was a prayerful and difficult process as he considered whether
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.320]   or not he would take on that ministry.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.000]   He had political reasons to be reluctant.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.880]   After all, the Nazis had been the enemies of the allied forces throughout all of World
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.640]   War II, and he was being asked to minister to the enemy.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.840]   More than that, he had personal and family reasons to hesitate.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.220]   Two of his adult sons fighting for the U.S. Army had been severely injured in their conflicts
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.920]   with the Germans.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.860]   And of course, he had the moral revulsion and aversion that we would all feel.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.620]   He had been to the Dachau concentration camp, and he had seen the aftermath of the horrors
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.020]   that took place there.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.600]   According to his biographer, he had leaned his hand against the blood-soaked walls at
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Dachau and felt viscerally the horror of that evil.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:56.360]   And yet he was being asked if he would serve as the pastor, the minister, the chaplain
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.680]   to the men who had been the closest associates and confidants and colleagues of Adolf Hitler
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.280]   himself.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:15.580]   You can understand why it was a tough decision.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:23.200]   Well Gehrig, he accepted that assignment, but it was not because of any affection for
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.600]   the Nazi Party or what the Third Reich represented.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:35.240]   It was instead because he believed in the power of the gospel.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.840]   And he knew that if there was any hope for any sinner, including the leadership of the
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:51.560]   Nazi Party, Nazi war criminals, if there was any hope for them, it could only be found
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   in the forgiveness that is offered through Jesus Christ.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:06.640]   Well, in our text this morning, Mark chapter 2, verses 1 to 17, there are no Nazis.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:16.360]   But there are two men, two accounts, one of a paralytic in verses 1 through 12, and one
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.720]   of a tax collector in verses 13 through 17.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:29.760]   Two men who lived very different lives, though they were both from the same town of Capernaum.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:40.480]   One a paralytic who was completely incapacitated, likely quadriplegic, unable to move, entirely
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:49.840]   dependent on others to do anything, hopeless, helpless, and completely desperate.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   The other, a tax collector, a publican, one who had betrayed his own countrymen, was willing
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:06.080]   to exploit them and extort them in order to pad his own pockets, considered the worst
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:14.840]   of the worst, hated by his own people, he was deeply despised.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.760]   And in the minds of the first-century Jewish religious system, the first man, because of
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.820]   his physical infirmity, would have been considered under some form of divine judgment.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:33.160]   And the second man, because of choices he had made, would have been regarded as outside
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:40.800]   the scope of God's forgiveness and pardon.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.920]   Yet these two men, though their lives were very different, shared one essential need
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:53.440]   because they had one great problem, the same problem that every sinner has, the problem
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.400]   of unforgiven sin and the need for forgiveness.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.520]   And this morning, I want to highlight the glory of divine forgiveness from this passage.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.320]   We're going to look at these two accounts, we're actually going to consider them in parallel
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.200]   fashion, going back and forth between the two.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   Both accounts are found together in all three of the Synoptic Gospels, in Matthew chapter
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.200]   9, in Luke chapter 5, and here in Mark 2.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.620]   And I believe they're placed together because they took place in chronological sequence,
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:39.780]   one right after the other, and yet in God's providence, that chronological sequence also
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.800]   serves to make a powerful theological point.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.140]   And I hope to demonstrate that point to you this morning from this text.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:59.600]   Now I've chosen Mark's gospel of the three Synoptic Gospels to convey these accounts
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:10.320]   to you, and I've done that in part because, as you know, Mark records the memoirs of Peter.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.040]   And I just think it's interesting to consider these accounts from Peter's perspective.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:23.280]   The gospel of Mark really is the gospel according to Peter as written down by Mark.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.720]   And the first account took place at Peter's house, and the second account took place near
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.840]   the seashore where Peter often fished.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:41.340]   Now as we consider the context of these two accounts, here in the book of Mark, Mark of
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.840]   course begins his gospel with the public ministry of John the Baptist and then the public ministry
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.920]   of Jesus.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:56.240]   And in Mark chapter 1, what we see highlighted repeatedly is Jesus' authority, His divine
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:03.780]   authority to cast out demons and to heal disease.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:09.680]   In Mark chapter 1 verse 22, we see that Jesus had authority to teach, that He taught, unlike
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.120]   the scribes and Pharisees, as one having authority.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:24.680]   And then in verses 22 or 23 to 28, we see His authority over demons expressed as He
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.920]   casts out the demon from the man in the synagogue.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:37.200]   Verses 29 to 31, His authority over disease as He heals Peter's mother-in-law.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.560]   In the verses that follow, we see His authority to cast out many demons and to heal many diseases.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.320]   And the climax of chapter 1 ends with the poignant passage of the leper who comes to
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:57.520]   Him in an incredibly moving scene, the leper pleads, "Lord, if You are willing, You can
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:07.960]   make me clean," and our Savior responds to him by saying, "I am willing, be cleansed."
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   And so in Mark chapter 1, you see the authority, the divine authority of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:24.640]   but it is expressed in ways that alleviate the temporal suffering of those who receive
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.440]   the benefit of those healing miracles.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.080]   Christ has the authority to alleviate temporary suffering by bringing physical healing and
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:44.240]   by casting out demons, and even by making one who was ceremonially unclean clean.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.720]   The question still remains as we come into Mark 2, does He have the authority to accomplish
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:56.280]   that same kind of salvation, not in a temporal and physical sense, but in an eternal and
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:02.480]   everlasting spiritual sense?
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:09.360]   Does He have the authority not only over sickness and not only over the spiritual forces of
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.040]   the demonic world, but does He have authority over sin itself such that He can pardon and
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.120]   forgive?
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.240]   The immediate context of the first scene is found in verses 1 and 2.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.780]   We see that Jesus has returned to Capernaum.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:33.720]   He has returned to what is the home base of His Galilean ministry, and specifically He's
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.800]   returned to Peter's house, and He's teaching in the house, and the crowds are flocking
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.480]   to Him.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.960]   No doubt some are convicted by the authoritative weight of His teaching, others are simply
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.420]   curious because they've heard about the miracles.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:58.440]   So whether drawn by conviction or curiosity, the reality is that He is pressed in by the
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.160]   crowds.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:08.040]   It is literally standing room only in that small space.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.520]   And then if you were to look down at verse 13, you see a very similar immediate context
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.800]   for the second scene.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.840]   Here Jesus has left the house and has gone down to the seashore, and yet He is still
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.500]   pressed in by the crowds.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:32.360]   And in both contexts, He is teaching them, specifically verse 2, He is teaching them
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.620]   the Word of God.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:46.600]   And the lesson that He will impart to them on this occasion is a lesson that I am confident
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:54.980]   none who were there ever forgot, and one that has direct import for us today, a lesson about
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.140]   the power of forgiveness.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.500]   Now as we work our way through these two accounts, and again we're going to go through them in
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.620]   parallel fashion, going from one account to the other and back and forth, we're going
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:18.900]   to organize our thoughts around five elements in these accounts that help us work through
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:25.780]   the unfolding drama, but the point of all of it is to magnify the glory and wonder of
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.260]   divine forgiveness.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:42.100]   The first of these five elements I have simply called "the sinners," "the sinners."
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:50.140]   We meet two different sinners in these two accounts, the first in verses 3 and 4, the
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:57.940]   second in verse 14, and the first is the paralytic.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:06.580]   Mark says this in chapter 2 verses 3 and 4, "And they came bringing to Jesus a paralytic,
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:13.700]   carried by four men, and being unable to get to him because of the crowd, they removed
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.940]   the roof above him.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:23.780]   And when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.780]   lying."
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:32.460]   A couple of observations jump out from these verses.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.660]   First of all, we see the inability of the paralytic himself.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:45.300]   Verse 3, he is completely unable to do anything for himself, unable to move, unable to help
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.740]   himself to anything, and yet he has heard, no doubt, about the healing ministry of Jesus,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:18:00.700]   the reputation of our Lord is spreading throughout Capernaum and the surrounding regions of Galilee,
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:08.540]   and so desperate for healing, desperate to meet the Savior.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:15.460]   This man has no way to get to Jesus unless someone else helps him.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:25.120]   And the theme of inability is again emphasized in verse 4 because even after this man finds
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:35.420]   four friends to carry him to Jesus, the friends are still unable to get to Jesus.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:43.780]   They encounter a wall of people, impenetrable.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:54.440]   The other synoptic accounts indicate that the door was completely blocked, desperate.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:04.200]   These men make their way to the roof, and they begin to dig.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:12.920]   Typical first-century Galilean house was built with crisscrossing timbers to create the roof.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.040]   Large timbers that functioned as beams, smaller timbers that functioned as rafters, and then
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.360]   thatch that was put over those rafters, and then finally a mud and clay mixture that was
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.280]   laid on top to create a solid and waterproof surface.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.200]   It was strong enough that you could stand on the roof, and because the roofs were flat,
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.800]   oftentimes staircases were put on the outside so that you could access that space like an
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.440]   outdoor deck or patio.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:56.540]   And these men, in their desperation, in their desire to get to Jesus, they climb those stairs.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.960]   And I'm sure it must have been a remarkable moment for everyone in the house below when
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:12.840]   all of a sudden they started to hear digging above, as debris began to fall down, and dust
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:22.480]   and straw and hardened mud and clay is hitting the ground and getting in people's hair.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.200]   And I have to think about this moment again from Peter's perspective.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.800]   This is his house.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.260]   Nobody wants a hole in their roof.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.500]   And then a little bit of daylight, and then the daylight gets bigger and bigger, and suddenly
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:47.840]   there's four faces peering down and a crowd below looking up, and everyone in the room
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:54.700]   except for Jesus is wondering, "What are you guys doing?"
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:02.080]   And then a pallet appears, and it is slowly lowered to the floor.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:15.160]   Well, we're going to have to leave that sinner there suspended in the air and look at our
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:26.300]   second scene, the second sinner, to use the old King James, the publican – I like that
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:36.660]   because it's alliterated with the paralytic – but the tax collector.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:43.020]   Mark chapter 2 verse 14, the first part of the verse, "And Jesus, or as Jesus passed
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:54.180]   by, He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in a tax booth."
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:59.700]   What are we to make of this second sinner, this man named Levi, the son of Alphaeus?
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:07.740]   Well, I think it's significant that his Hebrew name, Levi, is used in this context.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.980]   We of course know him by his more familiar Greek name, Matthew, but here he is called
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:20.740]   by his Hebrew name, Levi, indicating almost certainly that he was from the tribe of Levi,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.820]   the tribe of Levi, the Levitical tribe being the priestly tribe.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:32.380]   If Levi had been true to his family heritage, he would have been a spiritual leader in Israel,
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.500]   one who would help in temple worship.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:42.180]   Not only that, but we're told that he's the son of Alphaeus, indicating or at least
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:48.880]   suggesting that he was from a respected Jewish family.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:57.620]   And yet, this man had turned his back on that spiritual privilege and on his own family's
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:06.620]   reputation in order to pursue his own greed and to pad his own pockets.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:19.160]   Capernaum, because it was the largest city on the Sea of Galilee, was a prime spot for
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.560]   Rome to collect taxes.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.720]   Rome collected taxes on all sorts of things, poll taxes, land taxes, taxes on the transport
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.460]   of goods and even on travel.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:41.340]   And given the location of Levi's tax booth near the seashore, it's likely that he collected
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:48.680]   taxes on those who were transporting goods to the market, including those who had recently
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.940]   caught fish in the Sea of Galilee and were bringing it to sell.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:03.980]   Again, I think about this from Peter's perspective because Peter was a fisherman, and Peter along
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.060]   with Andrew and James and John, they likely knew Levi well.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:16.060]   This is the guy that always takes his cut.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:24.520]   Tax collectors were the most hated class of people within first century Jewish society.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:31.040]   They were viewed as traitors and turncoats, as sellouts, as those who were willing to
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:41.180]   extort and exploit their own people in order to collect money for the hated Roman oppressors.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:47.860]   Rome generally collected or insisted on a quota to be collected by tax collectors, but
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.860]   then anything that they collected above and beyond that quota they could keep for themselves.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:25:04.380]   And as a result, this model, it bred all sorts of corruption and greed and exploitation.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:13.960]   So here we have Levi sitting in his tax booth, hated by his countrymen, likely disowned by
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:22.800]   his own family, consumed with greed and yet overwhelmed with guilt.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   I want you to consider for a moment again the condition of these two sinners.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:42.720]   The first, utterly unable, and the second, deeply despised.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:54.440]   A cripple and a criminal, one desperate, one detested, the paralytic and the publican.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:03.760]   Well, we move then to the second element in these two accounts, from the sinners to the
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.600]   Savior, from the sinners to the Savior.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.640]   Let's go back to our first account.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   We've left this paralytic suspended in midair, being lowered down by his four friends, eventually
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:30.500]   and slowly being lowered to the ground.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:37.000]   Everyone in that crowded room perplexed and perturbed, Peter in particular wondering what
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.800]   has happened to his house, and Jesus alone knowing that what is about to happen is a
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.500]   divine and sovereign appointment.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:54.560]   And as that man is lowered down to the ground, I imagine him looking up at Christ and Christ
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:02.740]   looking back at him and recognizing this man's true need.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:15.860]   He says to him in verse 5, "Son, I say to you, your sins are forgiven.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:22.620]   Your sins are forgiven."
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:29.760]   Rather than focusing on the temporal healing that I'm sure this man desired, Jesus instead
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.060]   focuses on that which is eternal.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.180]   He looks past the external to the internal.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.740]   He looks at this man's heart.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:47.980]   And again, within first century Judaism, it was very common to view those who were sick
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:54.500]   or those who were physically infirm as being the subjects or the objects of God's special
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:01.740]   divine wrath and judgment, that this man must have sinned in some great way that he would
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.940]   be in this condition.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:12.700]   And what relief this man must have felt in that instant when looking at our Lord he hears
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:23.020]   the Lord say to him, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:32.020]   What mercy, what kindness, what compassion, what a Savior.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:44.020]   Well, there's a similar thing that happens in the second account because with the calling
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:50.540]   of Levi, we again meet the Savior in verses 14 and 15.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:57.620]   And as Jesus passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax booth.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.160]   And he said to him, "Follow me."
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.460]   And Levi got up and followed Jesus.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:12.700]   And it happened that Jesus was reclining at Levi's table in his house.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:19.620]   And many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:26.300]   many of them, and they were following him.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:34.260]   I want you to notice that it was Jesus who saw Levi.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.860]   In Luke 5, it says that Jesus noticed Levi.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:46.420]   It was Jesus who took the initiative and who called Levi to repentance.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.700]   And according to Luke chapter 5 again, Levi, having been summoned to follow Christ, left
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:30:03.000]   everything and followed him.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:14.220]   Not only did Jesus call Levi to repentance and by implication offer him forgiveness,
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:22.900]   but Jesus was willing to fellowship with this now former tax collector and all of Matthew's
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.720]   friends.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:31.580]   The account from Luke again says that Matthew held a great feast and he called all of his
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.700]   friends, all of the other tax collectors, and all of the other social outcasts, they
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.360]   all came.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.420]   And here in Mark 2, we read that they were hearing Jesus and they were following him.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:51.380]   And what I think is so interesting is if you look at that first account in verse 5, it
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:58.900]   says that Jesus noticed the faith of the four friends and of the paralytic.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:04.840]   And here in verse 14, we have Matthew now, and Matthew's friends exhibit repentance.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:13.120]   And so we have both faith and repentance highlighted in these two accounts.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.420]   And yet it is Christ who takes the initiative in both accounts.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:24.960]   He sees the paralytic's true need, and He sees Levi in the tax booth, and He offers
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.560]   forgiveness both to the paralytic and to the publican.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:38.560]   And having forgiven Matthew, He not only allows a former tax collector to be one of His disciples,
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.800]   but He's willing to fellowship with Him and His friends such that He would sit down with
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   them and eat a meal together.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:54.220]   Well, this is absolutely incredible.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:32:00.700]   No self-respecting rabbi would ever eat with such overt sinners.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.720]   But our Lord doesn't care about those kinds of external things.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.200]   He's focused on the heart.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:15.040]   And so you have in these accounts two sinners who meet one Savior.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.080]   And when they meet that Savior, they are given what they truly need.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:25.280]   They are given forgiveness, and they're given the gift of faith and the gift of repentance
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.420]   such that a paralytic becomes a new creature in Christ, and a tax collector becomes a follower
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:36.500]   of Jesus.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.440]   This is the power of the gospel.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.540]   It is the wonder and the triumph of divine pardon.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:51.780]   Well, that brings us to the third element in these two accounts.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:58.940]   We move from the sinners to the Savior and now the skeptics, the skeptics.
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:06.120]   As per usual, the scribes and Pharisees are standing by like hawks.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:14.340]   They're looking for anything that they can use to pounce, to criticize, to call into
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.760]   question the credibility of Jesus and His ministry.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:26.480]   We see this in the first account in verses 6 and 7, "But some of the scribes were sitting
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.440]   there and reasoning in their hearts," verse 7, "Why does this man speak this way?
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.960]   He is blaspheming.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.040]   No one can forgive sins but God alone."
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:53.600]   What's interesting about this response is that the conclusion is almost theologically
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   orthodox.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:03.180]   It is true that no one can forgive sins but God alone.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:08.000]   And yet there is one glaring problem.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.840]   Blinded by their own unbelief and their hard-heartedness, the scribes and Pharisees are unwilling to
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:22.080]   acknowledge the obvious, and that is that the man standing before them, Jesus Christ,
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.620]   the Son of Man, is God the Son.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.720]   But in their unwillingness to believe, they conclude He must be blaspheming.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:41.660]   No one can forgive sins other than God, and this man is claiming to do what only God can
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.660]   do.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:48.880]   Well, let's look at their skeptical response in the second account because in a similar
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:56.140]   parallel fashion, we have in this second account again the arrival of the skeptics, verse 16,
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:02.500]   "When the scribes and Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors,
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:11.240]   they said to His disciples, 'Why is He eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?'"
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:17.060]   They see what's happening and they are incredulous.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:24.740]   They assumed, in keeping with their first-century legalism, that no righteous person would ever
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:34.340]   associate with such obvious miscreants.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:40.620]   In the first account, we have the paralytic and his four friends respond in faith.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:48.300]   In the second account, we have the tax collector and his friends respond with repentance.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.040]   Such is not true of the scribes and Pharisees.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.160]   Instead of responding with faith, they question Jesus' claim.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.760]   And here, instead of responding with repentance, like Levi and his friends had done, they respond
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:14.480]   with judgmentalism, self-righteousness, and offense.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:20.640]   If Jesus were from God, He would not associate with such people, would He?
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.920]   And you'll notice in verse 7, they ask the question, "Why?"
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:30.840]   And here in verse 16, again, they ask the question, "Why?
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.760]   Why would He speak this way?
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.360]   Why would He eat with such people?"
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:42.200]   But their question, "Why?" is not motivated out of some sort of genuine curiosity.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:49.760]   It is condemnation and indignation and judgmentalism that motivates their question.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.200]   Why would He do this?
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.560]   And although their question stems from a heart of unbelief, it nonetheless sets the stage
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:04.040]   for the next element in our outline, what I call the showdown.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   The showdown.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.280]   It's almost like one of those old westerns.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:18.940]   As the drama unfolds, we have conflict, and that conflict will be resolved in remarkable
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:24.040]   ways in both of these accounts.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:30.520]   Our Lord's response in both accounts is stunning.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:36.440]   Let's consider the first, Mark chapter 2 verses 8 through 12.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:44.400]   How does Jesus respond to the first question, "Why does He speak in this way?"
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:51.040]   "Immediately, Jesus, aware in His Spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.920]   said to them, 'Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?'"
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:04.760]   Verse 9, "Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.400]   up, pick up your pallet and walk?'
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.000]   But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.980]   said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet and go home.'
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:27.240]   And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, 'We have never seen anything
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.680]   like this.'"
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.760]   What an astonishing miracle.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:51.120]   A paralyzed man, a quadriplegic, completely incapacitated, unable to move, so incapacitated
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:59.800]   that it required four other friends to move him anywhere.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:12.600]   With a single word, the Creator of the universe gives this man full health, and legs that
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:19.480]   had atrophied over time were suddenly given full strength so that he is able to stand
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:27.520]   up, and arms that had not been used perhaps for decades are given the stamina to pick
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.720]   up his bed.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.920]   He doesn't need physical therapy.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.340]   He doesn't need time to recover.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.440]   He doesn't need to learn how to regain his balance.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:46.300]   He's just told, "Get up and walk," and he jumps up.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:53.160]   Because when the Creator of the universe makes something that is broken new, it is ready
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.020]   to go.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:03.420]   And he stands, and the man who couldn't get into the room, even being carried on a stretcher,
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:10.040]   leaves the room by walking out the front door, and I'm guessing, jumping and skipping and
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:19.100]   dancing and singing and being very excited.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:25.780]   And what is the response now of Peter and the others in the house?
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.140]   They're not thinking about the hole in the roof anymore.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:34.000]   They're thinking about a broken man who was suddenly made whole.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.740]   And Capernaum was a small enough place that probably everybody knew this man.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.580]   They knew his story.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.740]   They knew what he had suffered.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:49.300]   And for the one who had been afflicted for so long to leave that room in this way, this
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:55.860]   was a miracle that was astonishing, and they were astounded, and they responded by praising
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:05.780]   God in verse 12, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before."
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.420]   And what did this prove?
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:16.220]   Well, it proved that Jesus' claim to be able to forgive sins was a valid claim.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.680]   Jesus' claim to forgive sins is something that only God can do.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.700]   And Jesus proves that He has the authority to do what only God can do by healing a man
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:31.400]   in a way that only God could heal that man.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:38.860]   And in that moment and with that miracle, our Lord proves that He is God the Son and
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:47.060]   that He has the authority on earth to forgive sins.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:57.500]   The second scene, also an ending that at least for those who were there would have been surprising.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:03.620]   And, of course, we are familiar with these accounts.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:09.100]   I'm sure many of you men have preached through this passage or one of the parallel accounts.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:14.800]   We know how these stories end, but imagine yourself in the shoes of those who are experiencing
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.260]   these things in real time, how astonishing this must have been.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:26.460]   In verse 16, the scribes asked the question, "Why," similar to what they did in verse 7,
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:32.500]   "Why is Jesus eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners?
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.340]   Why is He associating with the dregs of society?"
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:46.860]   Well, Jesus responds in a way that would have been shocking because in a first century context
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:56.660]   there was no one more spiritual, no one more noble than the scribes and the Pharisees.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.020]   And Jesus answers their question, "Why," in verse 17.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:07.500]   And hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a physician,
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.460]   but those who are sick.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:17.060]   I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:23.860]   The words "to repentance" are actually from the parallel account in Luke chapter 5, but
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:33.580]   again it underscores Matthew's genuine and sincere response.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:40.120]   Our Lord here uses an illustration from the medical world to make an important spiritual
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.420]   point.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:50.980]   People who don't think they are sick, people who assume they are healthy, don't seek help
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.900]   from a doctor.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:44:03.660]   Only those who know they are sick, who recognize that they need help, ask for that help.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:09.880]   Blinded by their self-righteousness, the Pharisees didn't think they needed help.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.560]   They didn't think they needed forgiveness.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:22.480]   They didn't need the mercy, the compassion, the grace that Jesus Himself offered.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:28.680]   And in a way that would have seemed so paradoxical to those in the first century, the group that
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:35.600]   understood that they needed divine mercy was the group that recognized that they were sinners,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.960]   the tax collectors, Matthew and his friends.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.720]   And so Jesus says to these stubborn, hard-hearted Pharisees, "I came to seek and save that which
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.280]   was and is lost."
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:45:00.200]   "I came to bring forgiveness to those who recognize they need forgiveness."
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:06.960]   And like the tax collector in Luke 18 who recognizing his own spiritual bankruptcy cried
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:12.840]   out for mercy, "Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner."
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:25.520]   God is pleased to answer that prayer because that man went home justified.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:34.400]   So you have this incredible miracle, the healing of this paralytic, and then this incredible
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:44.860]   rebuke from our Lord denouncing the self-righteous blindness of the Pharisees and underscoring
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.400]   the reality of the gospel that it is only those who recognize the desperateness of their
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:46:01.240]   condition who are given eyes of faith and a heart of repentance and the gift of forgiveness.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:09.880]   So we've seen these two sinners who meet one great Savior, and that one great Savior meets
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:17.080]   their greatest need, and yet they're criticized by the self-righteous skeptics, which leads
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:23.840]   to this showdown between Christ and the Pharisees.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:31.200]   Brings us to our final point this morning, what I am simply calling the significance,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.680]   the significance.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:39.880]   What is the significance of these two accounts?
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:47.440]   And really, I want us to consider this final point with three considerations.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:57.480]   First, I want us to consider the picture of our fallen condition, the picture of our fallen
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.600]   condition that is depicted in these two accounts.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.600]   Again we go back to the two sinners that we meet in this passage, one a paralytic completely
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:19.640]   unable and the other a tax collector totally despised, one helpless and the other viewed
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:28.240]   as being outside of the reach of God's grace and therefore hopeless, one utterly unable
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:36.160]   and the other totally depraved, consumed by his greed and consumed by his guilt, total
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:42.800]   inability and total unwillingness.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:49.640]   Are not these two sinners, brothers, a picture of us?
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:48:03.080]   That before Christ saw us and healed us, that we were totally unable and totally unwilling,
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:14.960]   that we were desperately, desperately incapacitated and deeply, deeply detestable and despicable
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:22.040]   in the sight of a holy God.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.800]   And so I love how these two stories place those two sinners side by side because we
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:35.600]   see in both of them pictures of ourselves, unable and unworthy.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:45.020]   Second consideration is the price of our redemption, the price of our redemption.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:57.960]   Look again at verse 9, because in verse 9 Jesus asks the Pharisees, "Which is easier?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:05.020]   Is it easier to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say to him, 'Get
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.420]   up and walk?'"
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:15.500]   Well, clearly from a human perspective, it's easier to make a claim that doesn't require
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.180]   any immediate validation.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:21.020]   In other words, it's easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," because there's no real
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.900]   way to prove whether or not that's happened.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:29.100]   It's harder to say, "Get up and walk," because if you say that, it requires an immediate
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:35.740]   miracle in order to validate what's just been said.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:40.940]   But I want to ask a different question this morning as we consider the price of our redemption,
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:49.220]   and that question is this, "Which is easier to do?"
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:55.860]   Not which is easier to say, but which is easier to accomplish?
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:01.540]   You see, for God the Son, the Creator of the universe, for Him to say to a paralyzed man,
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:07.780]   "Get up and walk," He doesn't even break a sweat.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:14.260]   But for Him to offer that man forgiveness, for Him to offer that sinner forgiveness,
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:19.740]   or the tax collector forgiveness, or you and me forgiveness, for Him to offer any sinner
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:26.700]   forgiveness, what does that require of Him?
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.540]   On the one hand, He doesn't even break a sweat.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:40.140]   On the other, He sweats drops of blood, blood, sweat, and tears, and He dies on a cross.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:48.980]   Because when He offered that man forgiveness, it was conditioned on His own sacrifice.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:55.700]   So which is easier to say, "Yes, your sins are forgiven," but which is easier to do?
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:02.740]   For the Creator of the universe, it is far easier to grant this man His physical health
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:10.300]   than it is for Him to redeem His soul from eternal condemnation in hell.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:17.300]   So consider, brothers, the price of our redemption, that the forgiveness that is offered in these
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:23.580]   two accounts is not a cheap forgiveness, but a forgiveness that was won through the ultimate
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   price, an infinite price, the death of our Lord and Savior on the cross.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:41.220]   And then thirdly, I want you to consider the provision of our salvation.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:47.860]   The picture of our condition, we were unable and unwilling.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:56.220]   The price of our redemption, the ultimate price, and the provision of our salvation.
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:02.000]   I noted earlier that I believe these two accounts are placed together in all three synoptic
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.940]   gospels because they make one compelling theological point.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.620]   And that point is simply this.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:18.860]   In the first account, we see that our Savior is able to forgive sins.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:25.340]   He has both the authority and the ability to forgive sins.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:31.860]   And in the second account, we see that He is willing to forgive sinners.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:42.240]   He has the willingness and the desire to pursue and to redeem the worst of the worst.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.020]   If He was able but unwilling, we would be lost in our sins.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:54.900]   We would be like that tax collector before Jesus saved him.
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:53:03.500]   And if He was willing but not able, we would be equally lost.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:13.980]   Our hope would be disappointed because He would not be who He claimed to be.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.940]   But do you see the glory of the gospel in this text?
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:24.780]   Because He is able and because He is willing, He offers forgiveness to all who cry out to
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:34.940]   Him for mercy, including those who are utterly unable and those who are totally despicable.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.420]   And so, again, we say what we said at the beginning, the power and necessity of forgiveness
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:48.260]   is this, that without it, no sinner, no matter how noble or moral, no matter how pharisaical
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:53.700]   or self-righteous, no sinner can achieve the righteousness necessary to enter into heaven.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:54:01.060]   And yet with forgiveness, through the work of our Lord Jesus Christ, through divine pardon,
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:09.700]   any sinner, no matter how helpless or hopeless, can be pardoned, can be justified, can be
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:19.180]   given the hope of eternal life and welcomed into heaven and the presence of God.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:29.620]   So we began this morning by talking about Henry Garricky, U.S. Army chaplain who was
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:37.020]   appointed as the chaplain to the Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:44.660]   The Nuremberg trials took place from November of 1945 through October of 1946.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:51.260]   There were 21 Nazi leaders who stood trial during those trials.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:59.020]   Garricky, being faithful to his calling, met with each man who was under his spiritual
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.700]   care.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.100]   He met with them frequently.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.780]   He met with them individually.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.100]   He gave them Bibles.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.100]   He gave them gospel tracts.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:12.960]   He shared with them the good news of forgiveness available through Jesus Christ.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.780]   He held chapel services.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:26.220]   And wouldn't you know, one by one, many of those men repented.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:32.220]   In fact, according to Garricky's testimony of the 21 men who stood trial, there were
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:40.420]   10 who repented of their sins and embraced the Lord Jesus Christ in faith.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.120]   Now not all of the Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg were executed.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:53.160]   There were 10 of them who were executed on October 16, 1946.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:56:02.360]   And Garricky would walk with the condemned all the way to the gallows, praying with them.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.960]   And the first man to be executed was a man named von Ribbentrop.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.940]   He was Hitler's foreign minister.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:18.420]   And just four weeks before he was executed, he had professed faith in Christ.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.520]   And according to Garricky, he had demonstrated the fruits of repentance, a genuine hunger
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:28.220]   for the Word, a genuine desire to commune with God in prayer.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:36.100]   And Garricky walked up the 13 stairs to the platform of the gallows with von Ribbentrop.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:44.060]   And as von Ribbentrop stood there above the trap door, he gave his formal final last words,
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.940]   which included a prayer for God's mercy.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:56.260]   And after giving his official last statement, he turned and he looked at Garricky.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:02.420]   And as the noose was being fitted around his neck, he said to this man who had ministered
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   to him over the last 11 months, "I will see you again one day."
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:23.080]   Now, brothers, that sends shivers down my spine, in part because it exposes the limitations
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.220]   of my own understanding of what grace can accomplish.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:32.840]   We're talking about Nazis.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:41.500]   And yet it's a powerful illustration of the truth of Mark chapter 2 verses 1 to 17.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:51.400]   Because if Jesus can forgive one who is desperately unable, and if He can forgive one who is deeply
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:58:00.660]   despised and detestable, if He can forgive a thief on a cross, if He can forgive a former
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:14.100]   Pharisee who persecuted the church, if He can forgive you and if He can forgive me,
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:19.060]   and that's the wonder of the gospel.
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:29.860]   And that's the triumph of divine pardon, that the truth of God's grace in Christ triumphs
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:41.500]   over the truth of what we deserve as those who are both utterly unable and desperately
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.300]   wicked.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:49.220]   Let's pray.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:54.200]   Heavenly Father, thank You for the truth of Your Word here in Mark chapter 2, for the
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:59:03.540]   glory of the gospel, and for the magnificence of Your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:08.700]   For the wonder of what He accomplished at great personal sacrifice, that He would be
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:14.120]   the substitute who paid the penalty for the sins of all who would believe in Him such
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:19.940]   that He could tell that paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:25.440]   And even earlier tell a leper, "I am willing, be cleansed."
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:31.060]   We give You all the thanks, and we know that all of the glory goes to You, and we look
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:36.480]   forward to the day when we will enter the presence of our Savior and sing praises to
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.660]   His name for all of eternity.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.520]   We pray this in His name, amen.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.520]   Amen.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:42.520]   Amen.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.580]   you
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:54.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
