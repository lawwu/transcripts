[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.260]   - One of the themes we address on the podcast is retirement
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.680]   and how to not waste the retirement years.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.940]   We've talked about end of life decisions as well,
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.680]   but very little about inheritances and wills,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.840]   but we do so today,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.840]   initiated by a really important question
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.260]   that came from an anonymous woman.
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.040]   Here's what she wrote.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.820]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.000]   My husband and I are in our 70s,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.680]   both working and healthy by God's kindness.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.120]   Of course, we're all terminal, as you know.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760]   Here's my question.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.280]   We own a property valued at nearly $2 million.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400]   Additionally, we own investment properties
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.520]   that will fund our expenses
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.840]   when we can no longer bring in income.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.440]   My question is about who will inherit our assets
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.720]   when we're gone.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.840]   We have three children.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.940]   One does not follow the Lord.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.120]   One is a believer who married a spouse
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.820]   who is not very serious about the things of God.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.260]   And one is disabled with mental illness.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.200]   Our first two children are materially fine.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.600]   Currently, I'm inclined to leave the bulk of our assets
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.440]   to Christian ministries and invest in the kingdom of God
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.200]   with a modest trust fund set up for our third child.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.400]   How do you navigate this decision?
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.480]   The Bible says, quote,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.640]   "A good man leaves an inheritance
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.320]   to his children's children," end quote.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.880]   That's Proverbs 13, 22,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.520]   but I feel an opposite approach would be wiser here.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.420]   Is it?
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.760]   - Well, first let me say that I am answering this question
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.900]   right off of our front burner
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.000]   because we too are in our 70s,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.460]   the same as you.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.340]   And we have been sitting.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.880]   Just a few weeks ago,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   Noelle and I sat down with two lawyers
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.380]   and one of our sons
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.880]   and a financial counselor from a Christian agency
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.720]   and had a big powwow about wills and trusts
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.820]   and medical directives to try to get our house in order.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.160]   And we have been thinking a lot.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.560]   We got the green light from two of our sons
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.260]   to be willing to function as executors,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.860]   which they don't call them executors anymore, amazingly.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.700]   You know why?
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.240]   Because it's a masculine word.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.500]   Oh my goodness.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.080]   Personal representative is what they say now.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.200]   Isn't that unbelievable?
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.040]   - Yes.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.880]   - Unbelievable.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.980]   Great, okay, that's another podcast.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920]   (both laughing)
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.060]   So we involved a Christian financial service
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.620]   that we trust to give us good counsel.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.160]   And Noelle and I have spent a lot of time thinking
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.520]   and praying about the issue of inheritance.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.660]   That's the first thing to say.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.100]   It's right off our front burner.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.040]   The second thing I want to do
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   is give a brief comment about two biblical passages.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.600]   A first, the one you mentioned,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.180]   a good man leaves an inheritance to his children,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.480]   but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.680]   That's Proverbs 13, 22.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.080]   I don't think the point of this proverb
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   is that a good man should or has a duty
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.960]   to leave an inheritance to his children and grandchildren,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.500]   but that in general, a good man has the resources
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700]   and the ability to do it,
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.160]   and that his children and grandchildren
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.600]   will experience blessing because they had a good man
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.160]   for a father and a grandfather.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.120]   I don't think it's a command, but a blessing,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.160]   because the contrast in the second half of the verse
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   goes like this.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   The sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.120]   In other words, he thinks, the wicked man, the sinner,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.360]   thinks he's accumulating wealth for himself and his heirs,
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.840]   but it's not gonna work out that way.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   So the point seems to be not that every person has a duty
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.200]   to leave an inheritance of any particular kind
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.040]   of material goods,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   but that the good person is in a position to do so,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   to bless his heirs,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.560]   and the unrighteous man is not in a position
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.260]   to bless his heirs in the same way.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.440]   Or to put it another way,
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.080]   children and grandchildren are blessed
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.240]   to have a righteous father and grandfather.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.760]   Blessing will flow to them one way or the other,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.200]   but not so the children of an unrighteous father.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.980]   And even that hope, I think,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.200]   is only a typical proverbial generalization,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.760]   because we know from the Bible
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   that many ungodly people leave huge inheritances
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   to their children, often to their ruin.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.560]   For example, Psalm 17, 13,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.840]   deliver my soul from men of the world
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.320]   whose portion is in this life.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.340]   You fill their womb with treasures.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.760]   They are satisfied with children
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.080]   and they leave their abundance to their infants.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.280]   That's Psalm 17, 13.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.120]   In other words, often unrighteous people
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.960]   are very wealthy and leave lots of deadly money
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.580]   for their heirs.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.560]   So some wicked men have great inheritances,
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.780]   but some righteous men are very poor.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.680]   Proverbs 28, 6, better is a poor man
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.800]   who walks in his integrity
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.720]   than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.640]   So the point is, proverbs are generalizations,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.520]   and in general, the righteous are in a position
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.440]   to leave a precious legacy, financial and otherwise,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.480]   to their children and grandchildren.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.200]   Now, the other text I wanted to make a comment about
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.000]   that she didn't mention, but I think people will mention
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.360]   if they push into the Bible on this,
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.120]   is 2 Corinthians 12, 14,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.040]   where Paul thinks of himself as a parent to his churches
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.920]   and says, "For children are not obliged to save up
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.320]   "for their parents, but parents for their children."
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   Now, the point, I think, is not about inheritances
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.000]   in that verse, because even if it were,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.720]   the argument wouldn't work
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.400]   because of the way he relates to his churches.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.160]   He's not gonna die in order to be a blessing
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.200]   to the churches.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.120]   The point is that parents are to support their children
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.960]   while they are growing up.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.440]   So whether we leave inheritances to children
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.000]   and how much we leave to our children should be decided,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.720]   I'm arguing, on the basis of wider biblical teachings
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.560]   rather than on the basis of that proverb
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.680]   or that passage in 2 Corinthians.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.520]   So let me mention five things that Noelle and I
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.680]   have taken into account that might also inform our friend
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.480]   who's asking this question and maybe some others.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.940]   Number one, be generous to your children
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.840]   while you are alive and while you can see
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.400]   how they are doing and what their needs are.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.760]   For example, when my father died and left me some money,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.040]   left me and my sister some money,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.480]   Noelle and I had a wonderful time taking a picture
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.840]   of my dad from an old photograph, putting it in a card,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.520]   writing a special little message about his legacy
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.200]   and sending a lot of money to each of our kids.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.240]   Surprised them with some thousands of dollars
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.840]   that, 'cause we just didn't need it.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.640]   We didn't need the money that daddy left us.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.960]   So the point is, while your children are alive,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.680]   bear witness to the sufficiency of Jesus
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   by being generous to them according to their real needs
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.920]   rather than waiting for the blessing to only come
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.040]   when you're gone.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.640]   Here's number two, be aware of the dangers of wealth
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.520]   for yourself and for your children.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.560]   Jesus said very plainly, "It's hard for a rich person
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.400]   "to get into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.760]   Matthew 19, 23.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   Being rich is not necessarily a blessing.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.920]   Far more often, it is a curse.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   There are many legacies to leave children
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.280]   that are vastly more important than money.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.840]   That's number two, be aware of that danger.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.680]   Number three, this is especially true
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   when wealth is gotten easily and quickly.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.560]   For example, with inheritances.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   Proverbs 13, 11, "Wealth gained hastily will dwindle,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.680]   "but whoever gathers little by little will increase."
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   Or Proverbs 20, 21, "An inheritance gained hastily
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   "in the beginning will not be blessed in the end."
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.480]   In other words, like the prodigal son,
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.080]   got all of his inheritance at once,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.680]   give it to me, dad, dad gives it to him,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.160]   and he goes off and ruins his life with it.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.840]   Wastes his whole life until God gets ahold of him.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.440]   That's number three.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.320]   Not only is money dangerous, money gotten quickly
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.240]   and easily is even more dangerous.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   Number four, rather than leaving your entire estate
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.920]   open-ended to all of your offspring,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.460]   consider picking an actual dollar amount.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.560]   I'm not counting here actual things like furniture
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.680]   or books or some heirloom.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.520]   I'm just talking about the actual cash.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   And leave a fixed amount to each son or daughter
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.840]   and then leave all the rest to Christian ministries
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.680]   that you believe in.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.780]   This decision felt very freeing to Noelle and me.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.120]   We tried to decide what the house and the car
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.560]   and the saving accounts, et cetera,
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.160]   if everything were liquidated, what would that be worth?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   And then we picked a number that each child would get,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.640]   I think, a significant generous number
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.000]   and yet a limited number that isn't the totality
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.800]   of the estate.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.480]   Everything else we're gonna give,
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.160]   we're gonna leave to the National Christian Foundation
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.800]   'cause I presume you know about them.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.120]   They distribute the money according to the way you want it.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.240]   Can go to your church, can go to Desiring God for Mom,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.000]   can go to Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.760]   And so the reason it's so much easier
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.720]   to leave your residual amounts to a foundation like that
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.440]   is because to change your will is difficult
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.400]   if you specify the ministries in your will,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.280]   whereas I can get on the phone and within a minute,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.440]   change the place that the money will go out
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.080]   from the National Christian Foundation.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.880]   So just a hint that if you decide to leave large amounts
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.720]   of money to Christian ministries,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.240]   there's an easy way to do it without specifying
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.840]   those ministries in your will.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.840]   And I'm sure you're far ahead of me
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   on that kind of research.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.160]   But here's the last thing, number five.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.640]   By all means, take thought for special needs,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.360]   especially children or grandchildren with disabilities
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.680]   or other difficulties that would make life harder for them.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.960]   So special trust accounts and things like that
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.080]   is a beautiful Christian act of love, I think.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.400]   So those are the ways, some of them,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.320]   that Noelle and I have thought through so far.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.360]   We don't claim to be perfect in this,
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.160]   but let me stress in closing,
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.440]   as I'm sure you already know,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   that vastly more important than any financial legacy
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.700]   is the legacy of biblical truth
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.600]   and the glorious gospel of Christ
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.680]   and a life showing the love of Christ.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.520]   - Yeah, very good.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.360]   Thank you for sharing this process, Pastor John,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.000]   that you're going through with Noelle and your family.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.280]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.320]   Well, this podcast launched nine years ago.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.200]   We're so grateful to God for sustaining grace
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.320]   over these nine years.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.240]   And we're back next time to address a question we get a lot.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.440]   Should I become a preacher?
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.600]   And if so, how would I know?
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.920]   That's the question next time,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.620]   very common one we get all the time.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.040]   We finally address it.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.320]   I'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.360]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.940]   (upbeat music)
