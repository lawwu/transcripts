[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.420]   >> Our distinguished guest of honor is the founder of the Vanguard Group and president
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.020]   of the Vanguard Global Financial Markets Research Center.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.060]   He created Vanguard in 1974 and served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.100]   1996 and then as Senior Chairman until 2000.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.020]   He entered the investment field immediately following his graduation from Princeton University
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.380]   Magna Cum Laude in Economics in 1951.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.580]   In 2004, Time Magazine named Mr. Bogo as one of the world's most powerful and influential
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.580]   people.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.540]   An institutional investor, presented him with his Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.140]   Time Magazine designated him as one of the Investing Industries for Giants of the 20th
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140]   Industry.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.500]   In the same year, he received the Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.660]   Distinguished Achievement in the Nation's Service.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.900]   In 1997, he was named one of the financial leaders of the 20th century in leadership
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.900]   and financial services.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.300]   In 1998, Mr. Bogo was presented the Award for Professional Excellence from the Association
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.380]   for Investment Management and Research, and in 1999, he was inducted into the Hall of
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.780]   Fame for the Fixed Income Security Analysis Society.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.980]   If I listed all his honors and achievements, we'd be out of time.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.420]   So without further ado, I'll dispense with that and ask you to please welcome our very
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:49.420]   special guest of honor, Mr. Jack Bogo.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.420]   There we go.
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.420]   Well, that says it all.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.420]   It's so nice to be with all of you, and I'm so honored by your trust in me and your confidence
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420]   in me.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.420]   And of course, in Vanguard, too, and just a terrific pleasure to be able to come and
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.420]   talk to all of you today.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420]   I'm a little embarrassed about all those awards.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.420]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.420]   I haven't gotten many recently.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.420]   But we'll hang on and press on regardless, I guess.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.420]   I'm happy you'll all be familiar with that phrase.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.420]   I'll probably take up pretty much the hour.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.420]   I don't know how to time this.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.420]   We were busy putting it all together, but I'm sure that we'll use a lot of time.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420]   And I presume that's what you want.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.420]   So we'll do our best.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.420]   You all honor me by your presence here this morning.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.420]   And yet another gathering of the Bogo heads.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.420]   Obviously, I'm glad to be here with my 16th anniversary of a heart transplant coming
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420]   up in February.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.420]   Obviously, I'd be glad to be anywhere this morning.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.420]   I'm pleased to say my longtime sidekick, so well-known to many of you, Kevin Laughlin,
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420]   is here this morning.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   And are you back there, Kev, somewhere?
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.420]   His fabulous work has moved in June into the Vanguard mainstream that not much of a career
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.420]   pad, but there are four people at the Bogo National Market Research Center.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.420]   And I don't think I'm going to be replaced when I go.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.420]   But the center is actually-- we supported Kevin to his ticket years.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.420]   So he's done gratis, like Mike Nolan, who's here with me this morning at the head table,
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420]   who's Kevin's replacement.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420]   And Mike's doing a wonderful job.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.420]   I started around June, June 1.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:59.420]   And so a very short learning curve has already become especially important part of our tiny
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.420]   research unit, along with Emily Snyder.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.420]   I don't know if Emily's here now.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.420]   She'll be here.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.420]   Many of you know her.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.420]   My longtime assistant of 25 years is Sarah Hoffman, who works with Emily.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.420]   And that's the Bogo Financial Markets Research Center.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.420]   And it's, in a way, encouraging to see all the new faces out in the audience this morning.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.420]   I understand there are 60 of you or so that are here for the first time.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.420]   And I guess I'm a little disappointed.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.420]   60 people at the airport apparently didn't want to come back again.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.420]   I do salute you for your courage.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.420]   And a special welcome from Mel and also Tim Dempsey, who I think have been an amazing
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.420]   group, who I think have been at all nine previous BogoHead gatherings.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.420]   And I'm closely followed by Gail Cox, who has done eight.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.420]   And I've already seen Gail this morning.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.420]   And we have a number of BogoHeads who are on your program, as you know.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.420]   Ed Tauro already spoke this morning.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.420]   I didn't get a chance to get briefed on what he said.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.420]   So what I said, watch the base of anything you're doing.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.420]   Well, we'll work that out in these two sessions.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.420]   And you're going to hear from Bill Schultz.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.420]   He's a long-term president.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.420]   Bill Bernstein.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.420]   Rick Perry just wrote a wonderful article for Forbes Hotline.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.420]   He's out being interviewed with Christine Benz from Morningstar, which is something
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.420]   I just completed.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.420]   And Laura Dogu.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.420]   And Alan Roth is here.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.420]   And Mel Lindauer.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.420]   I think they're all here.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.420]   And also, I think he's here.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.420]   If you raise your hand, you will.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.420]   His first visit is my friend Eric Schoenberg, who is the former editor of Money.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.420]   Is Eric here?
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.420]   Eric Schoenberg, we had to cancel the last one.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.420]   What the heck was that?
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.420]   [laughter]
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.420]   So I'll be seeing you on the podium here.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.420]   We're going to do a little break and then a Q&A.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.420]   And if this ends prematurely, don't get any ominous by that.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.420]   [laughter]
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.420]   We can start the Q&A before it's over.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.420]   And at the end, before we have a break.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.420]   And then I'll be with you for lunch.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   I brought some books that we're just going to give away.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.420]   I'll let Mel or somebody work out who's going to get them.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.420]   I've got 10 copies of Don't Count On It and 15 copies of the paperback edition of Enough,
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.420]   which has a board by Bill Clinton and an introduction by Tom Peters,
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.420]   the management group.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.420]   And so we'll be able to sign in after lunch.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.420]   But I'm going to retreat and probably take a nap.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.420]   And Bill, I will be with you at Vanguard later on in the afternoon.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:46.420]   And then, as if you haven't had enough of me, I'll be with Bill Bernstein in the traditional fireside chat.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.420]   And tomorrow morning I always look forward to working with Bill.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.420]   He and I have many, many ideas that are similar, if not identical,
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.420]   and a few, which might be interesting to talk about, a few differences along the way.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.420]   So here we are.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.420]   It's hard to believe it's 61 years.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:10.420]   I'm sorry, 51 years since my first heart attack in 1960.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.420]   And on a tennis court wearing a cricket club, I did win.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.420]   [laughter]
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.420]   Coming up, of course, the anniversary of my heart transplant.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.420]   I had kind of a hard summer, as some of you know from Jason's wife's interview.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.420]   And stupidly, I broke four ribs and ripped my left side, hit the tail.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.420]   But, you know, time heals all wounds.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   And finally, you get over it. That's about that.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:52.420]   I do notice at this stage in my life that I kind of divide it into two phases.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.420]   One, the much more frequent times when my energy is summoning me.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   And the much less frequent times when I had to summon my energy.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.420]   And I had to do that before my heart transplant.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.420]   I had to summon my energy after my tumble.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.420]   But it's all back now.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.420]   And now my energy is summoning me to be with you this morning.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.420]   It's been a very busy year for me.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.420]   I have another book that came out just after our last meeting,
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.420]   or at the same time, actually, of our meeting a year ago.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.420]   I'm counting on those couple of books here to be signed or whatever you'd like to say.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.420]   I've done a bunch of op-eds, as many of you know, for the Wall Street Journal,
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.420]   the New York Times, the Financial Times.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.420]   And they periodically ask me to send it in, and sometimes I do.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.420]   And I expect to do even more of that in 2012.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.420]   I've also been very busy on the interview scene, as some of you know.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.420]   The television demands seem almost insatiable.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.420]   I think I've done six or eight of them in the last two or three weeks.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:05.420]   And especially in this age of market turbulence, I do observe, for whatever it's worth,
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   that they call me much more often at down markets than up markets.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.420]   [laughter]
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.420]   I don't know what to say about that. It's so genie.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   All of this stuff is on my e-blog at johncbogle.com.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   I guess www.johncbogle.com.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.420]   And it doesn't get a lot of traffic, I don't think.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.420]   But in any mental way or anything you want to see that you miss, it's right there.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   And Michael's doing a terrific job of keeping that posted and current.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.420]   You probably wonder why it's called an e-blog.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.420]   It's not a blog. It's because e-blog is an anagram for Bogle.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.420]   Think of it. [laughter]
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:55.420]   And also during this year I celebrated my 60th year at Vanguard, July 5, 2011.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   So that anniversary gives me kind of a nice segue into Vanguard Today,
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.420]   which is the first part of this talk.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   And on that date, this last summer, I wrote a two-page memo to our veteran crew members
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:19.420]   who are 15 years or more, about 1,000 strong, and our Vanguard principals,
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.420]   which we now have 220 of them.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.420]   So I send my stuff out to them, and it seems worth doing.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:31.420]   And it's in a memo entitled "After 60 Years of Past Service, Looking to the Future,"
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.420]   and that's also on my e-blog.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.420]   And rather than dwell on the past, however, there's not really much point to that.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.420]   I wanted to look ahead to Vanguard's 100th anniversary,
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.420]   which will take place on December 28, 2028.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   That will be the 100th anniversary of our first fund, the Wellington Fund.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:57.420]   And in this memo to the crew, I attached excerpts from a speech I gave way back in 1992,
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:04.420]   which was entitled "Vanguard, the First 100 Years," prematurely, of course.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.420]   And I also attached predicting that we'd still be around 100 years from now.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:15.420]   Very few corporations are, but one of them happened to be IBM.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.420]   And they, in June, published a nice pamphlet, two or three pages in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.420]   entitled "IBM at 100," published on their 100th anniversary,
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.420]   describing a huge change in the world we live in.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.420]   And for IBM, since it was founded by Thomas J. Watson way back in 1911,
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   closing with a conviction, quote, "A company can and must change everything about itself,
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:48.420]   everything about it except itself, about it, about itself, except its beliefs."
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:54.420]   And the final words in the IBM piece are "ever onward."
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.420]   And so it is with Vanguard.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   As we look ahead to that, except that I end my memo with "not ever onward,"
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.420]   but, of course, pressed on regardless.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:11.420]   As I look at Vanguard today, those founding beliefs are pretty much intact.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.420]   Simple investment strategies that apply to the core of our mission
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.420]   and the basic human values of fairness to our client owners.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.420]   That's you representing them all here today.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.420]   And respect for one another who serve our crew.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.420]   All our exponential growth puts terrible pressure on your ability to work in a nice human way.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:38.420]   I have a statement that I made many, many years ago when I was running the place.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   We have an awful lot of crew members here that have posted on their little cubicles,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   which is, "For God's sake, let's always keep Vanguard a place where judgment
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.420]   has at least a fighting chance to triumph over process."
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.420]   And it's very difficult to do when you get big.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   Everybody knows that.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.420]   So we fight against it, and I fight against it wherever I can.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.420]   I actually spend an hour in each award for excellence winners.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.420]   It's probably six or eight every quarter or ten.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:12.420]   And so I try and stay in touch and do what I can in my small way and keep Vanguard
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:18.420]   the same human values that I've always liked, enjoyed, and held high.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.420]   It's not to say that I agree, and we'll talk a little bit about it this morning,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.420]   with all of Vanguard's policies and operating decisions.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   I couldn't possibly agree with everything.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.420]   But I try and speak out what I do and act.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.420]   I don't get much complaint about it at all, at least to my face.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   [laughter]
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.420]   But I do understand, as I think everybody explains,
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   that our management team has to make tough choices,
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.420]   taking into account not only probabilities but consequences.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.420]   And I'm free of those responsibilities.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.420]   I don't have to worry about it.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.420]   So it's probably a good thing that I am.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.420]   And we have a fine management team.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.420]   Some of you will hear from me this afternoon, many of whom I know quite well.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.420]   And I'm pretty sure you'll be impressed.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:16.420]   So let's then go through a look at Vanguard today by going to our first slide.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:24.420]   Our assets have grown enormously, 500 times over since 1980.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.420]   Actually, it's more than that.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.420]   It's 1,000 times over if you go back to 1974, when we started 1.4 billion of assets,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.420]   and now we're 1.6 trillion.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.420]   Expenses also have soared up 350 times.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.420]   But the point is that two points in this chart.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   One, if you're growing extremely rapidly, you can afford to spend an awful lot of money
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.420]   and still make sure that the growth of expenses, which are up 350 times,
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.420]   I think I said that, is less than the growth in assets.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.420]   And hence our expense ratio has come down way, way, way down
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.420]   and continues to double our competitors.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.420]   You can see the number of crew members there on the chart per billion of assets.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.420]   And we've done a great job on that.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:18.420]   In fact, our 12,000 crew members today are almost the exact same number we had
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:25.420]   when Vanguard hit 800 billion, I guess, in about 2002 or 2003.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:31.420]   So that's been a great job that we've done, partly economies of scale,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:36.420]   which are natural, partly a really good job, Paul Heller, Morgan, Bob, and Stefano,
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.420]   on technologies and technology.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.420]   A lot of it's pretty impersonal, but that's the way it has to be done today,
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   and I think people are getting more and more used to it.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.420]   So that's the theory of compounding I've talked a lot about.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.420]   And if you want to go to the next chart, Michael,
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.420]   how big will Vanguard be in the future?
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.420]   And we grew in the early years, which is 25 years, 25% a year,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.420]   a remarkable growth rate.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.420]   Obviously it never continued.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.420]   In the last 11 years, we've grown a 10% growth rate.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:15.420]   And even if we grow at, say, a 7% rate by 2025, it would be $4.1 trillion.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   And 7% is probably not unreasonable,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   provided we don't have the apocalypse or something like that,
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.420]   because these funds will have, of course, an internal rate of return
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.420]   and diminish, though it may be, from the past.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.420]   So we're going to get very big.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.420]   And I tried when I was here.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.420]   The speech I gave all those years ago was called
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.420]   "The Tyranny of Compounding,"
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   to be very conscious of how numbers grow as you grow in size
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   and at any kind of a reasonable growth rate.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.420]   And so I always was in favor of organic growth,
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.420]   letting our record and service speak for themselves
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.420]   and not forcing growth.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.420]   So as you can imagine, I'm a little bit skeptical about money spent on Vanguard-ing.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.420]   [laughter]
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.420]   The one caveat that--
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.420]   it's one slogan that I--one turn of the English language--
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.420]   that Merrill Lynch cannot use.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:20.420]   [laughter]
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.420]   So I'm still a small but beautiful guy.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.420]   Small but beautiful guy.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   But nice that, in the face of this enormous growth,
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.420]   we picked at the very beginning--
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   and I'll talk much more about this later on--
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.420]   an investment strategy that is basically scale-indexing
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.420]   and does not have the problems of size that, for example,
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.420]   a fair amount of capital group has.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.420]   You can't run a trillion and a half dollars
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.420]   on an active management basis
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   and expect to get any more significant.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   So the problem is, on the human side of the business--
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.420]   and I think everybody at Vanguard is trying to deal with it
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   to the extent we can make it still a personal place
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   where everybody feels respected
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.420]   and so much the better.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.420]   So growth--there it is. Here it comes.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.420]   And measured, I guess, mostly by our share of industry assets.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.420]   And you can see it just goes up and up and up.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.420]   And I don't know what's going to stop it.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.420]   So I've observed a couple of places.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.420]   These are long-term funds.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.420]   No, these are fall funds.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.420]   And county money market.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   Our long-term shares are around 16% or 17%.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   And no one in this business ever has had a market share that low.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   I say usually top out around 12% or 13%.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.420]   But even as that share grows,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   I have to confess that I don't take any of it for granted.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   I still love a good fight.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.420]   And so I'm particularly amused by this next comparison.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.420]   I want to throw that up my noose.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.420]   [laughter]
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.420]   These are long-term assets.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   That's 16.2% from 5.2% or actually up from 4%.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   While Fidelity is just going down and down.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.420]   They've lost market share year after year after year.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.420]   And I wonder what they're thinking.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   We had a director at Fidelity who was a good friend of a Vanguard director.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.420]   And I was known as "God" in their boardroom.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.420]   Not as a compliment, by the way.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.420]   [laughter]
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.420]   It was like Ed Johnson saying,
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.420]   "What do you suppose God's going to do about this?"
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.420]   [laughter]
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.420]   I don't know.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.420]   But it's an interesting competition, or was,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.420]   between Fidelity and us.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   Because for them it's kind of war and bad feelings.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.420]   With me it's kind of a happy competition
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.420]   in which whoever offers the best products at the lowest prices and the best service is going to win.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.420]   And I think that's what we're seeing on this chart.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.420]   And you can see their turn, if you look carefully.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.420]   Came right at the time that the bubble in the stock market burst in 1999.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.420]   That's their peak.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.420]   And it's down 40%. That's a big loss of market share.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.420]   A 40% decline to the 9% today.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   And it's only a matter of time until we'll be twice as big as they are in market share.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   It's amazing.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.420]   And these are long-term assets.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   You can see they're much bigger than we are in the money market.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.420]   Funfield, which has been very quiet at the moment.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   And when you take that into account,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.420]   and we're only, if that's the right word to use,
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.420]   $375 billion ahead of them.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.420]   So it's fun, and I like a good fight.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.420]   But it's not just Fidelity.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:39.420]   We're wearing the crown right now, the largest firm in the industry.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   As I mentioned, we're an all-time high in market share.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:48.420]   And when you take it and compare it to the competitive landscape when Vanguard began,
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.420]   we didn't do 74. It was easier to find the 1980 data.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.420]   We'll do 74 shortly when we have time.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   And you can see what's happened to those market shares of the leaders in those days.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   And you can see that just about everybody has lost, in some cases a lot.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.420]   You can see Putnam going from 4.2 to 0.6.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.420]   That's, as you tell me, an 80% loss in market share.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   And they earned every penny of it.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   [laughter]
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.420]   And Capital Group just slowed that way down.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.420]   I was afraid it was actually shrinking at the moment.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.420]   It was the only significant one.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.420]   The only one that went up in market share compared to Vanguard.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:40.420]   So the competitive landscape is saying, I think,
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:46.420]   that indexing is popular, that the demands in the marketplace,
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   that the balance between bond funds and stock funds is much more oriented towards bonds.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   And most people in the industry have had a big help in the last decade.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.420]   Our performance has been good. We'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.420]   People trust Vanguard, and I see this in that correspondence that I get literally every day.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:12.420]   And so it's hard to see at the moment how that growth is going to be interrupted
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   and where the real competition is coming from.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.420]   There are a few big firms on this list.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   You see Putnam, Capital, Merrill Lynch, BlackRock, that's a merger, and the rest of them.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   And Fidelity, of course.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   And then you go way down, and the next firm is probably really 3% or so of the industry assets,
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.420]   way down in leaders, and that has some implications that I hope everybody at Vanguard is thinking about.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:46.420]   And we've also become much more attractive to large investors, if you want to put up that chart.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   Way back in 1992, I had this idea that we should let the competitors know there was no point in their cutting costs,
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.420]   because we'd cut them further, and so they're just going to lose.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.420]   And so we did what we call "selective scale prices."
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   That's what I called it then, back in 1992.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   We started our first Admiral Fund, which meant if you put in larger amounts of money, you got a lower expense ratio.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   Simply respecting a brilliant decision, but simply reflecting the reality of pricing in this business.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:24.420]   And that is a $100,000 account, and probably has the same cost to us, maybe even a lower cost to us,
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.420]   than a $2,000 account, and yet they were both paying pretty much the same expense ratio.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   So we decided to do what was proper, encourage the larger investors who are important to our being,
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   and we'll reduce overall expense ratios for everybody.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   So this was a kind of low-cost, attracting 31% of our assets now, our admiral shares.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   This, I think, speaks for itself.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   But unfortunately, the press doesn't seem to get it right.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   They think we're cutting costs for the admiral shares.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.420]   Really, we're not cutting costs, we're operating costs.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   So when you reduce the cost on a certain group of funds, you're raising them, maybe immeasurably,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.420]   more than someone else, but it's not a big gap.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.420]   It doesn't change our revenues one penny over the other.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   So it looks pretty good, Vanguard growing, and doing, I think, pretty much the right things.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:23.420]   New York growth, of course, index funds, the driving force.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   Yes, we did start the first index mutual fund.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.420]   There was a little controversy about this, which you all, some of their number,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   are quite close on this point, but there were a couple letters in the Wall Street Journal
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.420]   implying that somehow I didn't really start the first index fund.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   Well, if there's anything that is clear in all this, that is the first index fund, period,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.420]   the first index mutual fund.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.420]   No one argues with that, but they say other people had the ideas.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   Even I had some back in my senior thesis in 1951,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.420]   talking about how hard it was to beat the index.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.420]   And one thing I want to mention to you, because you get to a point in this life
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.420]   where all you have is your credibility, and I thought some of those letters suggested
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.420]   I wasn't telling the whole truth about the other people that worked on this issue.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.420]   And the fact is, I've been telling the truth about it, the whole truth,
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.420]   about the truth, since about 1995 or '96 when indexing started to get popular,
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.420]   giving full credit to Jeremy Grantham, who tried to do indexing and failed back in 1971,
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.420]   and for his trouble was awarded by Pensions and Investment magazine,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.420]   the worst idea in years.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   Pensions and Investment described Jeremy's foray.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   And I talked about guys I know personally, like Bill Faust, and Macklepone,
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   and Wells Fargo, they were pioneers in this area in a very sophisticated way.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.420]   I don't do it in a sophisticated way.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   And other people that had come along the road.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:55.420]   And so we did start the first index fund, and as I've often reminded our crew,
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   in another context, totally irrelevant here, sure the ideas are out there,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   but what I've said is ideas are a dime a dozen, but implementation is everything.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.420]   And we didn't think about that term, implementation is everything.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.420]   We did it, I'm not sure the landscape would be much different if we hadn't been first,
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.420]   if we'd been second, or third, or fourth, but the fact of the matter is,
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   a recollection now, we started the fund, I know we started the fund in 1975,
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:29.420]   and I think the second index mutual fund was started by, I believe, Wells Fargo in 1982.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   That's a great idea when nobody copies it for six years.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:42.420]   So I wrote to the journal editors, did my piece with me, which was cut markedly,
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   like a period, I sent it actually to the journal editors, I'll just tell you a little anecdote,
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:54.420]   because I wanted some observation of our 30th anniversary, and I got going a little bit late,
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.420]   I just had the idea one afternoon of writing this piece, and I wrote it and got it home to them.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:06.420]   At that time it was, I think maybe July, August 28th or something,
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.420]   and the date is August 31st, when the underwriting took place.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.420]   And so I sent them this piece, the guys I know on the op-ed page don't know them well,
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.420]   and I said I want this to go into the review, it's too long for you guys.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.420]   So they looked at it and said, well why don't you give it to us first.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:28.420]   So I sent it to them, it was 2,000 words, and I knew they just don't do 2,000 words op-eds.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   They said if you can get it to 1,400 words, we think we can use it.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:39.420]   So I was a sucker, I cut it to 1,400 words, and I said to somebody,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:45.420]   doing that cutting reminded me of James Franco in 127 hours, cutting off his arm.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.420]   That's what editing my own commentary is.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.420]   And they come back with some more edits, we're now done with 1,000 words.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.420]   So it missed a lot, but it kept a lot, it kept the sense of it.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.420]   I had the option of saying nope, that's too much, you're out.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.420]   But then you get to that point and you say publish it the way it is.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.420]   So it wasn't as complete as I'd like it, but I have the complete one on my website too.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.420]   So for whatever that's worth.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:15.420]   But I am sensitive to anyone saying anything except yes, he did start the first index fund,
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   and no, he wasn't the first one to have the idea, I freely concede that.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.420]   Unless 1952, '51 was the first chance it met.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   So our strategies go far beyond the index fund.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   And that's what I'm going to talk mostly about here.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.420]   I'm going to talk about index funds, going to what I call virtual index funds.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.420]   And that's a description that people in our bond department do not like.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   But the whole idea of some of the funds we consider active is to have them as much like an index
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   as we can possibly make them when there isn't a suitable index around.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   So indexing share of equity fund assets has converged, giving rise to this great paradox.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.420]   The title of the speech I gave five or six, eight years ago, I can't remember.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:12.420]   Converges to great paradox, even as active management reflected in higher R-squares gets more and more like indexing.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.420]   So indexing gets more and more like active management.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.420]   And so I'm a kind of, what have they done to my song, mom?
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.420]   Tied it up in a plastic bag and turned it upside down.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:30.420]   And much of the growth of indexing, you can see it there, coming from exchange traded funds.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.420]   But indexing was 25%, 24% of equity fund assets.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:42.420]   If you go back five years, you think of the real importance of indexing and how it's taken over.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:49.420]   Cash flows into index funds, index mutual funds in the last five years were $630 million.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:57.420]   And cash flow into actively managed equity funds was $7.6 million.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:03.420]   That's a big difference, and that impact is going to continue.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:09.420]   Indexing is going to be more important, and people kind of don't recognize it, but they're starting to recognize it more, almost every day.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:16.420]   You see it in the financial analyst journals, you see it in the economist newspaper, you see it in a buttonwood column there.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.420]   It's become an accepted thing, you don't have to explain it anymore.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:31.420]   But beyond that, indexing, our great strategy from the beginning, I struggled for years and years to find the right words to describe it.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.420]   What I described in the beginning is having funds that have relative predictability.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.420]   There must be relative predictability to their categories.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:47.420]   And the idea is you can reduce behavioral problems of investors jumping on the hottest of things when buying it.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:54.420]   If you kind of tie, anchor your funds to a certain standard and have a high relative predictability.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   So not pure indexing, but virtual indexing, which has high correlation with a target, which has low turnover, low cost of course,
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   very low cost, and specific maturity standards in the case of compound funds.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:17.420]   And it's also true, I'll talk a little bit about this later on, it's also true of our multi-manager strategy.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.420]   I've always liked the multi-manager strategy.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.420]   Not because we can pick great managers, because we can't, and I couldn't.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:32.420]   I'm not casting any spurts, I think I batted 510, which I will say is probably better than Ted Williams, 406.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:37.420]   But not very good, and I don't know if we're batting 510 or 490 now.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:42.420]   But conceptually it's going to be, if you pick five managers of fund, they're going to end up being pretty much average.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   So when you go over to our market share, we totally dominate the index fund market.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:32:01.420]   And relatively small factor so far, ETS, and that's like 14% active fund share in the industry.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   Now I want to talk a little bit about this idea of correlations relative predictability.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:16.420]   So we can put this next chart up, and show you here the correlation of our, over on the far right,
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:22.420]   the correlations of our funds in each category with their targets.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:32.420]   Index funds, the correlation is 93, you look at virtual index funds, the index funds are 99, I'm surprised not 100.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:39.420]   Balanced funds are 100, meaning we match the index very closely.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.420]   The virtual index funds are very high, 93.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.420]   The bond funds usually explain by, those are our municipals mostly,
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.420]   usually explain by small differences in maturity or strategy compared to the industry.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:57.420]   And balanced funds, those Wellington funds, way up there, 98 I think, or 96 correlation.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:05.420]   On average, balanced funds are 99, and the actives, even so with multi-manager,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:11.420]   particularly in balance and equity, are 92 correlations.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:20.420]   And the idea is that don't have something that gets hot, like where Mr. Berkowitz is down 30% this year,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   I'm a last year's hero, it happens all the time.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.420]   I was talking to Christine Benz, the Morning Star lady, a little while ago,
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.420]   and I said, you know, you probably ought to stop picking managers of the year.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.420]   Every one of them turns out, ultimately, every one of them turns out to be,
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   a phrase I've often used, you think they're stars, but they turn out to be comets.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.420]   Lighting up the firmament for a moment in time.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.420]   They're then burning out, their ashes drifting gently down.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.420]   (laughter)
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.420]   Not a bad phrase, right?
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.420]   (laughter)
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.420]   So, we do this with multi-manager, we do it with municipal bond funds,
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.420]   with specific maturities, and give that relative predictability that we see.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.420]   A, with low cost, it's a perfect strategy.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.420]   Because if your correlation is perfect and you have lower cost, you're going to win.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   And so, that's what it's all about, and we continue to do that.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.420]   I'll talk a little bit later about some places where I'm not so sure.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   We haven't lost sight of that centrality of that goal,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.420]   but there's not any point in having a hot manager.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.420]   Good for a year, good for two years, maybe good for ten,
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.420]   but in the long run, it doesn't work so well.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.420]   So, we can, oh I guess this is a repeat.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.420]   What have you got next there?
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.420]   What are we showing, did I just talk about that?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.420]   Oh, those are some individual funds.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.420]   And you'll see Wellington there, '96 was their correlation.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.420]   Windsor '96, amazing, Windsor too.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.420]   Strategic equity even surprised me.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.420]   '98 prime cap, '93.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   And so, you'll see those individual funds are very, very tightly tied to their targets
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   and their best fit indexes, and they win because of that column.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   Oh, they're on the right, low expenses.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.420]   This is not complicated, and it looks little on a year-to-year basis.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.420]   These are annual expense ratios.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   When they compound over the years, there's all the difference in the world.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:34.420]   So, we see that growing, and see a growing part,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:39.420]   portion of bank arts assets, and you'll see what I call virtual.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.420]   Again, they don't like that term in the office.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.420]   They think they're active managers.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   In terms of muni bonds, which is sort of an issue here,
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   they are in their own way active managers.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.420]   We have very definite maturity standards, very definite quality standards,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.420]   and they're not to be violated, and they don't change all the time.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:02.420]   So, in any event, active share is very, very high.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.420]   It's dwindling half what it was in 1990, roughly half,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.420]   and the virtual share is now up to about 82%.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.420]   These aren't foreign numbers or anything like that,
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.420]   but just to give you an idea of the direction in which we're going.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:25.420]   So, the idea is not to disappoint, or as the subtitle of my 2005 book said,
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:31.420]   "The only way to guarantee your fair share of stock market returns," and it is.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:38.420]   So, in all this, the equity funds are kind of a wild card,
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.420]   and I'll show that next time.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.420]   Can we do this here?
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.420]   Yeah, I guess we can do that here.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   You can see how important cost is to this whole equation.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.420]   It's not the ability to pick great managers.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.420]   Not me either, as I said, but it's about keeping cost in,
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   and you'll see things from Vanguard that give you those blue bars there,
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   the extent to which our 10-year performance outpaces those of our competitors.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:12.420]   And you can see we're 100% in the bond area, 100% in the money market area,
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.420]   almost 90% in the balanced area, 61% in the stock area,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   meaning we have performance for our competitors.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.420]   But the reality is we're there because we have no low cost.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.420]   So, if you look at stock funds, we're below average manager picker.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.420]   X cost, just a little bit above average in bonds,
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.420]   which I don't think is a material thing in one way or the other.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.420]   Below average would just mean we have higher quality.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.420]   In balanced funds, money market funds, balanced funds maintain pretty well,
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   and money market funds, of course, drop radically.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   And that drop in the money market is simply because we've stayed with higher quality,
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.420]   and I'd never regret that.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   This is not a definitive chart.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.420]   This is a directional chart.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.420]   So, just a reality check.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.420]   So, it's not a good idea to brag about our ability to pick great managers
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.420]   because when you see the 61% or the 100% or the 89%,
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.420]   you're ignoring the fact that most of our advantage is in cost.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.420]   We had a guy that worked in our municipal department,
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:17.420]   a senior person, Jerry Jacobs, who had a superb record.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.420]   He ran the intermediate term municipal bond fund.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.420]   He was hired away for many millions of dollars a year by Putnam.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   And all of a sudden, this top manager became a bottom manager.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   Did he lose all his intelligence? No.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.420]   He went to work for a municipal bond fund and charged one and a quarter percent
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.420]   instead of two-tenths of one percent, and there went his record.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   I don't know why Putnam didn't examine it this way.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.420]   They might have done a little bit better.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.420]   They had a lot of problems there.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:50.420]   But in any event, it's a very growing impact on its cost,
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.420]   and it affects everything we do.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   I now want to turn to ETS as such.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   I mentioned that before.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.420]   I'll give you a little presentation here.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.420]   I mentioned what have they done to my song.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.420]   This is the answer.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.420]   This is my idea of buying and holding forever.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:13.420]   And then if you look back on the history of exchange-traded funds,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.420]   it's going to be probably the greatest marketing strategy of the first decade
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.420]   of the 21st century.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.420]   Has it been the greatest investment strategy?
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   Absolutely not.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.420]   How can we have a great marketing strategy for its investors?
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420]   Well, they won't figure it out.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.420]   Okay.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.420]   There's nothing the matter, to be clear, about buying an ETF
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   and holding it forever.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   You will do just as well if you do the total stock market,
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.420]   Vanguard total stock market.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:47.420]   If you buy the ETF, hold it as if you buy the regular fund.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.420]   I always thought when I came into this business,
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.420]   "My God, you can get your money back on any given day?"
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.420]   This was 1951.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.420]   I thought that was a miracle.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   And now it's in any given second.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:04.420]   And it does hold out the temptation to trade and is used to trade.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.420]   So we see ETFs now coming in for a certain amount of attention.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.420]   The New York Times had a headline the other day, "Volatility.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.420]   Thy name is ETF."
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   So I named the ETFs, particularly these triple, double, reverse lattes.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.420]   [laughter]
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.420]   Or whatever they are.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.420]   I hear people arming those things.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.420]   I don't know what they are.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   But we'll fancy it up.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.420]   Double leverage wasn't enough, so now it's triple leverage.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.420]   Going up was not fun.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.420]   Now I've got to get it to go down.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.420]   And it's not any question it played a big role in the flash crash
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.420]   a couple of years ago.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.420]   It is playing a big role in these wild gyrations.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.420]   We get closing hours in the market--closing hour in the marketplace.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.420]   And it doesn't seem to be part of the high-frequency trading syndrome,
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.420]   but that's another cause of all this volatility.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.420]   ETFs have also been at the center of a number of frauds and market manipulations,
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:07.420]   including that $2 billion loss taken by United UBS out of Switzerland,
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.420]   including a Goldman Sachs partner who was doing something illicit,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.420]   which I can't remember.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.420]   And I'm sure a lot more is done in the ETF area.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.420]   I was struck the other day--I'll open this one up for a second.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.420]   My wife and I were out shopping or something on a Saturday morning.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   I looked at the license plate on a car, on the car in front of me,
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.420]   and here's what it said.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   "Oh, gee."
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.420]   [laughter]
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.420]   She said--Eve said, "What does that mean?"
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   [laughter]
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.420]   I said, "Oh, my God, my idea. It's highest form. Index trader."
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.420]   And, of course, the guy was driving a Jaguar.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   [laughter]
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.420]   That's the world we have.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.420]   Vanguard has become a very strong entrant in the ETF market, I think, in a better way.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.420]   As far as I can tell, in a better way.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   While our market share is creeping up at 12%--we actually did 33%--
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:17.420]   that's creeping up from 4% to 12%, a triple in years.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   It's pretty good. Five years would be good.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.420]   Or, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's five years.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:32.420]   And we're actually now doing 33% of all the cash flow on the ETFs.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   So that's going to grow and grow.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.420]   And I just hope--and I have no way of knowing this.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:42.420]   You'll see that they'll be over there this afternoon, the guys that run our ETF business.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.420]   But I don't have to know.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.420]   And I've introduced myself to one of them. I hope to see you this afternoon.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.420]   [laughter]
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.420]   I hope they won't be nice.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.420]   [laughter]
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:59.420]   But I think, deep down, there honestly isn't a big difference between management's view and mine.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.420]   Implementation, again, may be different.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:06.420]   But nobody at Vanguard thinks trading ETFs for this kind of rapidity is a good idea.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.420]   You just can't believe that.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   And so we try and avoid that.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.420]   Yet, there's a lot of volatility in what we do and what everybody else does.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.420]   You can see this turnover is unbelievable.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.420]   If you want to go to the next chart.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:26.420]   The ProShares and Ultra SP flip, turns over at 17,669% a year.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.420]   An average holding period of 2.1 days.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   Spiders typically run around 10,000% a year.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.420]   And Ultra Short, now that's popular.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.420]   And take a guess at what the market's going to do.
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.420]   Magnified by three.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.420]   10,000% a year.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:45.420]   And then the more speculated index is Spiders via Qs.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   Other ones that are hot periodically.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.420]   China.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.420]   Look at Brazil.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.420]   2,146 holding period, 12 days.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   iShares emerging markets, 2,500.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.420]   Spider Gold shares, 1,500.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.420]   IFA index, more conservative than most, but still 1,000% a year.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   36-day holding period.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.420]   Vanguard is obviously doing better than that.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   But probably not better to suit May.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.420]   I think we're doing it right.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:21.420]   For example, our emerging markets index turns over at about 750% a year.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:28.420]   And that's a quarter, or whatever one wants to say, of what the MSCI is.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.420]   757%, still an awful lot of turnover.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.420]   Our total stock market is better.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   The quality at 300% a year, that's better.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:41.420]   I'm a guy that believes 20% turnover is pushing the envelope.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   So I look at these things and I think, what the hell?
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   What the heck is going on?
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:54.420]   But it raises the issue of is all this turnover good for investors?
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:59.420]   And a number of Vogelhead posts on this comment, you've probably seen many of them,
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.420]   saying that the idea that I have, they don't refer to any of these posts at all,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   that we want to be examining investor returns,
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:15.420]   returns those investors are making in these various ETF categories compared to the returns the fund makes.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:23.420]   To take an easy one, the large cap ETF investment funds have produced,
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:33.420]   obviously not a very good return over the last 10 years of 3.2% a year.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   But the average investor in those funds has earned 1.7%.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   So that's a cumulative loss over a decade of 18% of your capital,
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.420]   just by all I've traded.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   In business small cap, the cap is 48% over a decade.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   Add your money lost to the index standard.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:46:00.420]   International developed markets, these are what you know about, we'll talk more about that later.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   91% of the capital gets lost.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.420]   And in individual countries, it's 223.2.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   We didn't have emerging markets in individual countries.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.420]   The international developed was a lot of cold market.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.420]   And then we go to individual countries.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:25.420]   So people are betting on things like Brazil, or Nepal, or wherever else they are.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   And you can see that a 10% return is enormously different from compounding.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   4% and the investor grows to 56%, a very nice return, I admit.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.420]   14% is fund earns.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.420]   And it's regular time-weighted.
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.420]   Unit-weighted, if you will.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.420]   Return at 280%.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.420]   It's a huge gap.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:57.420]   We don't have these inverse and leveraged equity funds for 10 years.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.420]   So we used to look at five years, if you could put them in the above chart.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:05.420]   And you can see they're not starting off so very well.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:10.420]   Emerging markets lost 20% of your capital.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.420]   Inverse equity, 7%.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:16.420]   But look at how good the people were picking the inverse times.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:23.420]   If you stayed in that fund for five years, you lost 56% of your capital.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:31.420]   Yeah, you lost just 56% compared to only 49% for the return by the fund in that period of leverage.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.420]   So you just see this.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   Time-weighted returns are a little controversial.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.420]   I mean, sorry, investor returns, dollar-weighted returns.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.420]   So uncontroversial.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.420]   I first started talking about them.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.420]   We should have funds report them.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   Way back in 1996, one of my first speeches after getting out of the hospital.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   And everybody thought it was the dumbest idea they'd ever heard.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.420]   Because everybody knows what the fact is.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.420]   If you want to look at the return, the fund says, "Here's what we earned."
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.420]   You know in almost every case the investor earned less.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:09.420]   A little less, or a lot less, but less.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:15.420]   And you look at standard mutual funds, not ETS, the gaps are there, but much, much smaller.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:21.420]   So it's part of the business, but I don't think we should be in the business of taking advantage
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   of people's shortcomings and behavioral problems.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   So you commented, and that's an interesting subject,
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.420]   that one of the reforms I would like to see is that all mutual funds, ETS or otherwise,
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.420]   actually be required to report the returns their investors earned,
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.420]   and not just the returns the funds earned.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.420]   It's well within our technological capability.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   And you see these gaps shown in the next chart.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:50.420]   I just didn't, so dramatically, what I did was take the right-hand section of the other chart
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   and grabbed it, made a graphic.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.420]   And it's really quite startling, some of these are quite startling.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.420]   And so the ETS is getting more and more extreme, it's good marketing.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:09.420]   And so it's very disruptive to the markets, particularly these inverse equities, leverage equities.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.420]   And we shall see, but I don't like what I see so far.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:18.420]   In addition to these specialty areas, ETS has become the vehicle.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:25.420]   When you've got some amazing new investment idea, you go the ETF route rather than the regular fund route.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   Because the idea of ETS is a hot marketing idea.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:34.420]   And so you'd never probably hear of people like Rafi 100, Rob Arnott's thing,
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   or Jeremy Siegel's wisdom total dividend thing, if they just did it in the conventional way.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:46.420]   So they do the ETS, and they have the answers, these fundamental indexes.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.420]   Do you want to go to that?
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   And you can see that Jeremy Siegel was quoted as saying,
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:03.420]   "We're the pernickets of the new age, who buys the rules of the heavens."
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.420]   It's all going to be different now, and it's not.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.420]   You can see in the blue, that's Arnott's thing.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   It's much more volatile, produces a return, a point different from the Vanguard total stock market.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.420]   Not much difference, and that's a very short period.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:26.420]   I'm confident that the differences will just exist in a very small level,
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   and maybe a losing level in the long run because these funds cost not just their expense ratios,
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   which are high by my standards, but because of the turnover it takes to do that.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:42.420]   And curiously enough, I like that Jeremy Siegel's wisdom tree fund based on index,
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.420]   the total amount of dividends paid, so a big dividend pair would be larger on the list.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:57.420]   And if that was basically a total bomb, and that total dividend fund is now 1% of wisdom tree's total assets.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   1% is about 170 million out of 13 billion, and they've got more things for trading currencies.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   I have a list of them here, but I won't take your time to read it.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   But you look like you're reading a lunatic's map of the world.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   Who wants to buy or sell Indian rupees?
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.420]   But it's a strategy.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.420]   But in any event, if you took out of that chart over there,
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   the fact that Barnum and Ratley is significantly more volatile than, like, 15% more volatile than Vanguard's whole stock market,
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   it really accounts for the entire difference.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.420]   So it's much value.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:43.420]   He's the greatest salesman since P.T. Barnum, I think, and he still believes it's working.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.420]   But even I'm looking at this record.
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.420]   So there we are, industry headed off in the wrong direction.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:57.420]   In my opinion, and that's a big growth part of the industry.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:01.420]   It has to taper off, and investors have to get wise about the fact there's no trading.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   There's no money in trading rapidly in the stock markets.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:09.420]   And eventually, of course, like the gamblers in Las Vegas, they will have no money left.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:13.420]   And so that will be the end of the ETF.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.420]   I'm saying that a little hyperbolically.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:25.420]   But just use properly the right kind of funds, help in the long term, very diversified funds, bonds, stock, develop markets,
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.420]   maybe even emerging markets.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.420]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.420]   It's okay.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:36.420]   But if that accounts for 5% of the use of ETFs, it might be absolutely amazing.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.420]   And no one knows how to count that.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:44.420]   So let me talk now about, first, books.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:49.420]   And then some closing reflections on my lifetime.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   And I have copies of, I think I've brought about 10 copies of, don't count on it.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.420]   If you flew here, don't buy one.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.420]   I'm giving them away, so.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.420]   Mel, you'll have to figure out how to get rid of them.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.420]   I'll be glad to sign, as I said this afternoon.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:11.420]   I've had 15 copies of paper backing up, which is fine for the airplane travelers.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.420]   And I'll sign them after lunch.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:19.420]   So I just thought it might be interesting to reflect on the books.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.420]   Which, you know, I don't know.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.420]   I keep thinking that there must be something terribly the matter with me.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:31.420]   Because I don't know anybody else in the industry except for Peter Lynch who has written one book or two.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.420]   And there may be other people.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:36.420]   But I don't know them, so don't correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:41.420]   So I'm wondering, as an old expression, everybody is out of step but me.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.420]   [laughter]
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.420]   So maybe it's stupid.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.420]   In any event, they now go back to 1993.
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.420]   Which, tragically, tragically, I was the best seller of the whole bunch.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.420]   And I've gone downhill from there.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   [laughter]
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   But they all do pretty well.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:06.420]   And in particular, Little Book of Common Sense, the best thing is it's a small book.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.420]   And the only way to guarantee your fair share is Hop Market, which continues to do extremely well.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:18.420]   And even though it's now four years old, and we go by sales, we go by Amazon, we go by comments.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.420]   They get great comments on Amazon, mostly.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.420]   Four and a half stars.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   There's always somebody that doesn't like your books on Amazon.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.420]   It's very humbling to read that.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   And my favorite comment was, "This author has a real problem.
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.420]   He writes more like a novelist than an economist."
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.420]   [laughter]
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.420]   And I thought, "Well, if that's my problem, I'm feeling pretty good."
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.420]   [laughter]
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.420]   And someone wrote about Vogel and Mutual Funds way back among those years.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   You never forget the nasty comments.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   You forget the good ones pretty quickly.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:59.420]   But good analysis, poor conclusions.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.420]   [laughter]
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   Just what you'd expect from an MBA.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   [laughter]
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.420]   I was heartened by the fact I didn't have an MBA.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   [laughter]
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:14.420]   So, and even that great big orange tone, really did pretty well.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:20.420]   I can't tell you the numbers, but maybe 25,000 copies or something a typical business book sells, about 5,000.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:23.420]   And you know, it's not Michael Lewis territory, that I can assure you.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.420]   But I feel pretty good.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.420]   I want someone to look at these things and feel pretty good about what I've written, what I've written.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   And I think they will stand.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.420]   Someone wants to look at them and get a picture of this whole group of books
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   on the development of the financial industry and the mutual fund industry
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:43.420]   in its great growth phase in the '20s to the end of the '20s century.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:47.420]   And sort of consolidating phrase, "The phase that begins thereafter."
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.420]   I think they will get a good picture.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.420]   What life really was.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:55.420]   Not in retrospect, but what I was thinking and saying then.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.420]   Does anybody really care about that?
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.420]   I have absolutely no idea, but I care about it.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:01.420]   And that's good enough for me.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.420]   I'm working on my next book.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   And you've seen, I think, the original essay, which was turned into a speech at the Museum of Financial History.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:17.420]   The book is titled the same as the speech, "The Clash of Cultures, Investment vs. Speculation."
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   And I don't know, I think I only published it under the orange cover.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.420]   But that's where we are. They left that to me.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.420]   But that will be coming out.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:30.420]   I had to postpone it a little bit until February '28.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:38.420]   I had such a big setback in my health and my ability to sum up my energy for that matter.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.420]   It just took a little longer. It will take a little longer.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   I'm not really deeply into it yet.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:47.420]   But once I get through this thing today, I will be back to it pretty much full-time for the rest of the year.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   As much as I can.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.420]   So, I mentioned that first speech.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:59.420]   And I just want to give you this one example of how much speculation has taken over to the detriment of our society.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:07.420]   And that is, if you look at investment as we conventionally do, capitalism, capital formation.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.420]   That's directing capital to its highest and best uses.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:15.420]   Companies that are growing, companies that are providing better products and services at lower and lower prices.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   That's what investing in is, putting money in those companies.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   And every year, the American financial system directs about $200 billion into IPOs and into additional middle core frames of existing companies.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:42.420]   How much is speculation? If you take share turnover in the markets and multiply it by the price of shares, it is $40 trillion.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:49.420]   So that's 200 times, if I may, of speculation as we do investment.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.420]   And that's just a big waste for everybody except the croupiers and Wall Street.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:58.420]   They aren't too happy being quoted as croupiers.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.420]   They don't complain directly.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.420]   So that's going to be the first chapter.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.420]   The second one is very tandem.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.420]   I'm talking about the happy conspiracy between corporate managers and fund managers.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:10.420]   In this, there's been nothing written about this.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   The problem is based on what I call a dual agency society.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:19.420]   Agents always have problems putting their principal's interest before their own.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.420]   Whether it's money managers or corporations.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:24.420]   But now we have agents of agents.
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.420]   And that is to say these corporations are not owned by individuals.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   That would be the conventional agency problem.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.420]   But corporations that are controlled by corporations that represent individuals.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   And that's institutional investors and mostly mutual funds, the largest segment of that.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:44.420]   And these institutions own 70% of all the stock in America.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.420]   So this is a tremendous conflict of interest.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:53.420]   And many, many other things arise from this dual agency society.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.420]   I'm going to try and think of a better term for that.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.420]   I like to term happy conspiracy.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.420]   I used the title "The Silence of the Lambs" before.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.420]   It was taken when "The Silence of the Lambs" was in the news.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.420]   It was an evil movie.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:10.420]   And I want to get into the implications of all this trading and all these agency problems.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.420]   Into the lack of interest in corporate governance.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.420]   You've heard about that from me.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.420]   About our failure to do anything about the sane executive compensation.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.420]   Our unwillingness to stand up and be counted on corporate political contributions.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.420]   One of America's great outrages.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:28.420]   I know I'm not supposed to talk politics, but I said it and here it is.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   I changed character in the mutual fund industry.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:36.420]   In ETF chapter, index fund for investment or index fund for speculation.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:42.420]   I spent a lot of time talking about fiduciary duty and in fact have some work I've done earlier.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.420]   A measurement system.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:48.420]   Fiduciary duty, whether your manager is observing it or not.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.420]   Our retirement system.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:54.420]   The basic fundamental part of America, making sure we don't have everybody on a leaf when they retire.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.420]   And it's failing us.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   And I have a lot of ideas for fixing that.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.420]   I have some simple investment advice.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:07.420]   And then a chapter I'm really happy with and I am actually working on this now.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.420]   Is an example of what happens when a fund turns from investment to speculation.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.420]   And that is what happened in the case of Wellington Fund.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:21.420]   And I do that chapter first because we pay more attention to history.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.420]   And it's all gone.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:28.420]   And when I'm gone, I don't think anyone is even going to know the history that I'm describing in that chapter.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.420]   It's amazing.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:35.420]   But I've been in Wellington for 60 years, if it's 80 years, 83 year existence.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:41.420]   And I'm kind of the last guy that has the knowledge to do it.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.420]   So I think I have an obligation to do it.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.420]   I also have an obligation to honor my great mentor, Walter Morgan.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.420]   Who picked me up out of the air and made me into something I probably never would have been otherwise.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.420]   And that's a fun chapter.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.420]   It's like the real message.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:58.420]   Because the fall came, we did the merger back in 1967.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:04.420]   And in the following 10 years, the fund had the worst record relative to its competitors in its entire history.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420]   You can see it.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.420]   Because we compromised on quality.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   We had a slightly higher turnover.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:17.420]   And we took funds, a beta measurement to the market.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.420]   Which in Wellington should be about a 65, has been.
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.420]   We took it to 104.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.420]   We made Wellington into a stock fund.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   And it was only with a 73 or 74% equity ratio higher than we ever had.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   When the stocks are more speculative, you take that risk right up.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.420]   And then everything fell apart.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.420]   Fund drops. It's really a great story.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.420]   Fund assets dropped from $2 billion to $400 million.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:47.420]   And now it's back to $52 or $53 billion.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   And leading the balanced fund segment in the industry once again.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   So it's a fun story.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.420]   It's a story with a real lesson.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.420]   It's a story which is the very least of what I ought to be writing anywhere.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.420]   And I don't know what I'll do about looking ahead.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.420]   I'll think of something by then.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.420]   [Laughter]
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.420]   So now a few reflections on the market and a few investment principles.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:15.420]   Or at least reminders of the same.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.420]   What should I do now?
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   Keep going.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   [Applause]
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:34.420]   This should be maybe five more minutes.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.420]   The Asian market is 2011.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.420]   We've had bear markets all over the world, even in the U.S.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:46.420]   They don't tell us we had a bear market, but some genius once said it was a 20% decline.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   500 didn't go up, 500 didn't develop, a good performer this year.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.420]   Total stock market index in fact was down 20%.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.420]   Developed market index is 25, 26.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   Emerging dropped to 30.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:03.420]   And total international, combining the two, dropped to 27.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:07.420]   So we had this huge recovery.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.420]   I'll talk about that in a minute.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.420]   Since then, I've been very comfortable.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   The first big crash came, everyone wanted to know what to do.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.420]   And I said, "My advice is do nothing."
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.420]   Don't just stand there.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:22.420]   The old rule is don't just stand there, do something.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   That's what we always do in times of crisis.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.420]   And I said, "Don't do something, just stand there."
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.420]   [Laughter]
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:33.420]   You know, it takes a little, I guess, guts or stupidity to say that.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:38.420]   Because nobody knows, least of all, what's going to happen in the next days and weeks and months.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:42.420]   It turned out to be very good advice throughout all of this.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.420]   Because right now, we're back, I don't know how much I've updated.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.420]   Yeah, this is updated as of yesterday.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   Okay, so you can see we've had an enormous recovery.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.420]   500 index is not too far up to the year.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:57.420]   Emerging markets down 17%.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.420]   Total international down 12.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.420]   And then, of course, bonds giving a nice protective element.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.420]   All I have to say is this doesn't fit in the chart at all.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.420]   But I had to say it anyway.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.420]   But interestingly enough, it's been a great year for the bond market index fund.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.420]   Not because it's great.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.420]   It's very heavily weighted toward treasuries, U.S. treasuries, mortgage-backed bonds.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.420]   70% or something like that.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   Where that's a, you know, you'd say over-weighted in treasuries, except that's the market weight.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:30.420]   And so that made us very good in 2008, very bad in 2009.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   Okay in 2010, now excellent in 2011.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   And I just can't resist noting that the genius, and he is a genius, by the way, Bill Gross.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   I don't mean to take anything away from him.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   But even the best generals make mistakes.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   His bet against the treasuries proved to be wrong.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.420]   So we picked up 500 basis points.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:54.420]   Very, very unusual for the year.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:58.420]   Now, we have a bear market.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   Working on this new world has come back as well as after it.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:05.420]   And I was trying to make the point that sometimes in history,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   I always like to take a historical perspective,
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:12.420]   bear markets stop around 20% when you get over there.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:16.420]   And at some point, they continue to go down.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.420]   And we never know which is which.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:23.420]   But here's what this one looks like.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.420]   These are all the bear markets in the post-war period.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.420]   And you can see that you probably can't count them too quickly, but post-World War II,
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.420]   there were 12 such bear markets.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.420]   I counted that 19 as a 20.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.420]   Three got much worse, and nine didn't.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.420]   And we had no idea whether this was a pause, an interregnum,
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.420]   or whether it was going to get worse.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:46.420]   But I have to say, I'm always comforted when things start to consolidate and level out.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.420]   I don't like these bear markets.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.420]   They make me nervous, not so much nervous because I'm predicting the market,
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:56.420]   but nervous because at some point in which you have huge behavioral problems
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.420]   when the market does a certain thing, or it redeems their shares, and that makes it worse.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:05.420]   So I think maybe it's a slightly hopeful sign.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.420]   We shouldn't be looking so much at a chart like this,
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.420]   but rather what rational expectations are for the future.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:17.420]   And that brings me to a rule that you've heard from me a long time,
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   if you read all my stuff, nobody could.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:25.420]   And that is the idea is to stay the course if you're on the right course for you.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.420]   And that may involve being conservative for some and aggressive for others,
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.420]   depending on age and other factors.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.420]   But control what you can.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.420]   You can control time in two senses.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.420]   Start investing as early as you can, for example.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.420]   The difference between investing early and late is enormous.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   And then use long-term managers, not use short-term speculative managers.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.420]   Tax impact.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.420]   Risk, you can control.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:54.420]   If the fund controls it, and I mentioned Wellington Fund,
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:59.420]   you control risk at Wellington Fund back in the late '60s and early '70s.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   Wellington Fund didn't control its own risk.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.420]   So keep an eye on fund base.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.420]   And you can, of course, control costs, low-cost providers.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.420]   Use low-cost providers, use low-turnover funds, use no-over funds.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:17.420]   And when you can't control, which is returns, have rational expectations.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.420]   Let me just give you a quick gander at these rational expectations.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.420]   You've seen this in my stuff.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.420]   And this is the way to look at markets.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.420]   I mean, it's unequivocal that the source of market returns
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:29.420]   are dividends, earnings growth, and P/E change.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.420]   Any period you want to look at, days, weeks, months, that's all that happens.
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:38.420]   So this is kind of a rough guess of 2% dividend yield today,
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:42.420]   maybe 6% or 7% earnings growth, maybe 5%.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.420]   But in any event, maybe it's slightly over P/E.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:49.420]   Because P/E, as I mentioned to Christine,
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.420]   I don't think too much out of line, a little bit on my side.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:56.420]   And maybe 7% on stocks, which is doubling your money.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:01.420]   And bond returns are 2% on the 10-year Treasury, the benchmark.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:05.420]   But I think you almost have to be more aggressive than that now,
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.420]   because the benchmark is so short-term.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.420]   It's probably got a 5- or 6-year duration.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.420]   And 70% U.S. Treasuries.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:19.420]   And so it's probably a little more aggressive in your portfolio composition,
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   I mean, a level of the bond market.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   And I'm certainly not eliminating my position in the bond market.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.420]   I mean, if you look at these seemingly modest returns,
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   100% for stocks, possibly 50% for bonds, that's 3.5%.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:37.420]   Those returns aren't bad, but they're not gross returns.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.420]   So give your bond manager 100 basis points,
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:44.420]   and all of a sudden you get 3.5%, all of a sudden you're at 2.5%.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:49.420]   Give your stock manager a portfolio turnover, sales loads.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.420]   And then calculation, don't forget inflation.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.420]   These are nominal returns.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   And they really don't look very good.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.420]   But should you very prematurely leave the market standard,
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   you can't handle the low returns, I don't recommend that.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   You're bound by the market returns, ultimately, all of us as investors are.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   No secret about that.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.420]   But think about inflation when you look at that chart.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.420]   And then think about the fact those returns are before costs.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   Costs matter.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:24.420]   Yields are hard to come by today in that next chart.
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   There are the yields on our funds, and they're kind of funny.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.420]   I'm not sure exactly how we calculate them.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.420]   But those are what you'll see if you go to our website.
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:38.420]   But we know that the yields in recent years have ranged, bond yields,
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.420]   from 4% to 7%.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   And now they're coming up with 2% to 3% these last couple of years.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   So they're way below historical standards.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   But I still don't believe in reaching.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.420]   But if you want to go toward the long and toward the corporate
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   as compared to governments, municipal bonds are quite attractive
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   on a tax-adjusted basis.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.420]   And it's your own call.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.420]   And I don't do it, but people ought to be aware
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420]   that those yields are really pretty pathetic.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.420]   How much should it be in international?
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.420]   I think this is my kind of closing comments here.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   I tried to say, and I did it dramatically this year,
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.420]   don't talk about international.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.420]   Just look at the international, look at what you're buying.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.420]   So we want to put that next chart up.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:27.420]   You can see that if you want 55% of your money in Japan,
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:32.420]   which is not doing so well, in Britain, which austerity is costing them a lot,
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:37.420]   in France, which still doesn't work, that's 55% of your assets.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.420]   If that's what you want, do it.
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:43.420]   But don't put it under some idea that you have to be in international.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.420]   You have to be in those countries is what you're really saying.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.420]   It's half of the developed market index.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.420]   So think about that.
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:52.420]   When you get to the emerging markets, good or bad,
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   realize that half of it is in China, Korea, and Brazil.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.420]   As we all know in recent years is so-called BRICS.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:04.420]   Brazil, China, India, and Russia have been very good performers.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.420]   Inevitably, when the value goes, they're not going to do well.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   Think about what you're buying when you buy international.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.420]   I don't do international.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.420]   I've told you my reasons before.
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.420]   I don't think it's going to matter much in the long run,
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.420]   and the record would show that there are short-term fluctuations,
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.420]   but not long-term.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.420]   The main message I want to leave you is think about what you're getting.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.420]   Don't just say international is good.
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.420]   And the correlation is, of course, with U.S. markets.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:36.420]   It's bad and almost 100% 100.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:42.420]   In international diversification, the wise man set lets us down
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.420]   just when we need it the most, and that's true.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:51.420]   Finally, you have a bunch of posts on the board.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.420]   Our target of change and our target of retirement funds.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.420]   I just took this example for the 2005 to show you how much it's changed.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:03.420]   First, to increase the equity ratio, probably back in 2004 or '05,
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:09.420]   significantly increase it from the 60% it was at our inception,
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.420]   and then today 12% international for each U.S.,
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:21.420]   and then recently from 73% with the additional international
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.420]   and the additional change back in 2004 and '05.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.420]   73%--that's a big change.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:32.420]   73% and 22% international compared to '12,
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.420]   and the international change was made just recently.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.420]   And I don't--you know, I'm on the inside track,
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:42.420]   but I'd love to know the rationale for that.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.420]   There are people who are going to tell you.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   You tell us, as a matter of fact, yourselves.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.420]   It looks like we just do things to be competitive.
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   You also tell us that we couldn't have picked a worse time
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.420]   at international.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   It happens to be true.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.420]   I showed you we just left the darn thing alone.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:04.420]   The cumulative return would have been 51%, 51.5% total return,
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.420]   and then the fund actually delivered 37.9.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   Now, is that a prediction that we did the wrong thing?
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.420]   Please, no.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.420]   I have no idea whether they've done exactly the right thing or not,
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   but I do think maybe it would be worthwhile to have a little more
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   explanation of why it gets done, because it's very important.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   All right, now I have--that's it for the charts and numbers.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.420]   They're not there for themselves, all these numbers.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.420]   Underline--try and explain--underlie and explain the concept
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:40.420]   to apply my absolute conviction that mathematics and simplicity
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:45.420]   and economy and efficiency are the keys to successful investing
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.420]   for a lifetime.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:52.420]   Ultimately, I'm going to ask after I'm gone, those principles will
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:57.420]   in fact change the world of investing, and much more parenthetically.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.420]   We'll finally get the institutional money managers,
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   who I mentioned control 70% of every public corporation in America,
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   off their darn duffel bags, honor their fiduciary duty,
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.420]   and assume their full responsibility for citizenship.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.420]   That's not happening.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   And the index funds are at the bottom of the deck
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.420]   in terms of--ours and others--are at the bottom of the deck
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   in terms of activity and corporate governance.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:27.420]   It's easy to measure how you work on compensation plans.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:33.420]   That's a leadership vacuum that for the good of our country, I think,
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.420]   has to be filled.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:39.420]   The obvious leader is the index fund--should be, must be--
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:43.420]   because they buy and hold forever, and they can't follow the Wall Street rule,
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   which is if you don't like the management, sell the stock.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   Benjamin Graham, in his initial books, was very strong in recommending
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.420]   much more activism on the part of institutional investors
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   when it was only a small portion of what it is now.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:03.420]   And we should assume that wisdom and get back where we ought to be
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.420]   as corporate citizens.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.420]   So here I stand at age 82.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   I can't believe it.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.420]   Just a few simple innovations to my credit, I guess.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   Mutual structure, the index fund, the defined maturity bond fund,
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.420]   changes that as modest as they seem and as simple as they in fact are,
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:33.420]   are central to a mission with a giant goal--my giant goal--
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:37.420]   to make the world a better place for the investors
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.420]   who are earnestly seeking to save for their financial futures.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:44.420]   That's what's important about the financial system.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:49.420]   Compared to Steve Jobs--I guess I want to mention him and everybody else does--
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:54.420]   who simplified, packaged, and marketing "insanely great" products
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:59.420]   that changed all of our lives, my accomplishments, if I dare to even compare them,
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.420]   are modest to a fault.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:07.420]   I am struck with both the unfairness of life that enabled me,
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.420]   thanks to the miracles of modern technology and care,
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:16.420]   to outlive a man who was born four years after I graduated from college.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:19.420]   It's very, very sad.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.420]   Nonetheless, as I read the stories about his amazing life, truly amazing life,
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.420]   I'm really struck by some of the similarities we share.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.420]   Let me give you these couple.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.420]   Comment by venture capitals, Arthur Brock and Steve Jobs.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.420]   He got ideas in his head, and the hell with what anybody else wanted to do.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.420]   [laughter]
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.420]   Steve Jobs himself--getting fired, in his case, from Apple,
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   in my case, from Wellington--was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.420]   Steve again--I never asked customers what they wanted.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:53.420]   If it's something truly revolutionary, they won't be able to help you.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.420]   Simplify, simplify, simplify.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.420]   And finally, great companies must have a noble cause.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.420]   It's the leader's job to transfer that noble cause into an inspiring vision.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   I'm sure you see the parallels, even I acknowledge the comparisons,
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.420]   self-serving and very rewarding.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.420]   But whatever the elusive truth would tell us,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.420]   it's not yesterday's accomplishments that interest me.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:23.420]   It's tomorrow's challenges in changing the way we think about investing,
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.420]   even as I wait patiently--well, not really patiently, actually.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   [laughter]
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:34.420]   But I'll press on, regardless.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.420]   So thank you for your patience. Sorry to run over.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   We'll take a little break to catch our breath, and then I'll answer your questions.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   Thank you all so much.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:50.420]   [applause]
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.420]   [end of transcript]
