[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.480]   Let's move on to questions.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.240]   We will start as always with questions about deep work.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.520]   And our first question comes from Allison.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.720]   Allison asks, a recent corporate trend is to limit meetings to 30 minutes,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.640]   which means you have twice as many meetings in one day,
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.760]   all with different people on different subjects.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.080]   It's exhausting.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.320]   How can I get deep work done in between these short but
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.520]   taxing meetings, or should I even be trying?
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.920]   Well, Allison, I think we have two issues here.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.000]   Our first issue is just the abundance of meetings,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.160]   the increased abundance of meetings being an issue in work today.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.000]   And then the second issue is what right now you can do about that reality,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.720]   given that you can't change it tomorrow.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.800]   So there's this bigger picture.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.600]   Point here is that we have too many meetings.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.040]   Why do we have too many meetings?
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.760]   Well, I think there's a couple things going on here, but
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   one of the most important is that we don't have a lot of good systems in place for
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.760]   how we accomplish the work that happens regularly in our teams.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.280]   So a meeting becomes a proxy for more well-developed productivity systems.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.720]   Something falls on your plate.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640]   We have to figure out a new strategy for client acquisition.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.160]   The easiest thing you can do is say, let's get everyone in a meeting.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.200]   Because now what has happened, you have put something on your calendar,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.840]   you know everyone will show up, you know you will see it,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.440]   you know progress will be made.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.400]   Because as I say, there's only two productivity systems that every
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.440]   knowledge worker actually absolutely trust they will see, their email inbox and
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   their calendar, so you know you will see that.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.200]   You know everyone will show up, you'll know some sort of progress is made.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.720]   The issue is, if there's lots of projects going on,
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.160]   each of which needs to keep making progress, we get a lot of meetings.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.880]   Let's all just get together, let's all just talk, and
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520]   we feel like some sort of progress has been made.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   So to solve this bigger problem, if we apply the type of solutions I talk about
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.760]   in my book, A World Without Email, where we actually break down the work we do into
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.600]   its constituent processes, and we ask for each,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.000]   how do we actually want to implement this process?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.080]   Where does the information come in?
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.480]   How do we assign and track work?
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.360]   When and how do we talk about this work?
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.080]   What steps can be basically automated?
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.800]   It always happens A, B, and C, and what steps actually need discussion?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.640]   Can we batch this discussion with other things?
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.440]   Can we have a lot of structure to that discussion?
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.400]   Can it happen at the same time?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.360]   When you begin to structure these processes,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.760]   you get away from just throwing meetings at a problem, which turns out to be just
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   a very high overhead, low effectivity way of actually trying to get things done.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.480]   So I think that's the big picture solution.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.880]   In the small picture, Allison, you're facing a ton of meetings today, and
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.120]   that's not going to change tomorrow.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.640]   What can you do?
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.920]   There's two things I would recommend.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.720]   One, add 15 to 30 minutes to the end of every meeting that you schedule.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.560]   So if someone schedules a half hour meeting, you put aside the full hour.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.960]   And what do you do in that second 15 to 30 minutes?
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   That's where you make sense of, organize, act on, and
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.640]   otherwise take action on what was discussed in that meeting.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.120]   So while it's still fresh in your head, you clarify it.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.400]   Okay, so what's really going on here?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.960]   What do I really need to do?
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.300]   What can I do right now if there's a few small things just to get that done?
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.920]   Is there some big thing I now have to do?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.560]   Let me figure out maybe when I'm going to do that, get that on my calendar,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.520]   get this stuff into my systems,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.480]   make sure that I have full closure on what's happening in that meeting.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.160]   There is nothing worse than finishing a meeting that opens up seven or
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.720]   eight loops.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.760]   And before you can close those loops, you have to jump into another meeting,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.160]   which generates more loops, which conflicts with them.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.520]   So add 15 to 30 minutes on the end of every meeting.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.600]   Now you can get closure cognitively on each of these meetings.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.360]   So that's the first thing I would suggest.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   Two, start scheduling meetings with yourself.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.400]   Use the same calendar that you use for your other meetings.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.520]   Treat and respect those meetings like you would any other.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.800]   Once that time is blocked, that time is blocked.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.960]   But they are meetings with yourself that you actually use as time dedicated to
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   a specific task that's going to benefit from unbroken concentration.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.240]   You probably can't block off all of your time and say, great,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.800]   seven hours a day, I'm just going to be doing deep work.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.680]   And there's only 30 minutes left and it's only at this one time.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.160]   But you can say, I'm going to give myself a two hour meeting today and
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   two one hour meetings on Wednesday.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.320]   And these are meetings with myself.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.000]   So that time is blocked on my calendar.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.560]   I will not overschedule it with something else.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.240]   And it makes sure that progress gets done on things that actually require
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.320]   concentration.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.760]   So those two things, add the 15 to 30 minutes on the end of every meeting
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.480]   schedule to get closure.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.360]   Plus, scheduling meetings with yourself for
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.960]   making progress on things that require unbroken concentration.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   That will release the burden.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.200]   I'm going to add a bonus suggestion here that I had first brought up in a recent
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   episode.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.760]   So let me just remind you of this bonus suggestion,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.080]   which was this notion of one for you, one for me.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.960]   Okay, so an issue I talked about, this might have been last week or
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.320]   the week before, an issue I talked about when it came to trying to protect a large
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.960]   amount of your time for no meetings, for unbroken concentration,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.240]   is that even if you are in a role in which that is reasonable,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.680]   it's hard to figure out when that time should be in advance.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.920]   So let's say, for example, you are in development and
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.480]   four out of eight hours a day, you really should be programming.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.200]   Sometimes it's hard to say, I'm just going to block off the entire afternoon,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.680]   because that might be the only time that two out of three people in the executive
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.840]   committee that needs you to meet with them to talk about a new hiring policy.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.560]   That's the only time they can meet is the afternoon.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.480]   And it's actually a real issue if you blocked off in advance the entire
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.840]   afternoon, there's not enough flexibility.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.240]   If you're going to block off a lot of time,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.440]   there's not enough flexibility in your schedule to do that in advance.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.800]   So the suggestion I gave a couple weeks ago was don't block off
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.680]   that deep work time completely in advance.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.040]   Do a one for you, one for me strategy.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.640]   If I book a 90 minute meeting on the Tuesday, at that point,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.480]   I will then put aside 90 minutes somewhere else in the day for deep work.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800]   And then if someone comes around and says, okay,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.720]   here's a 30 minute meeting we need to do, great, book that.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.200]   And at that point, take another 30 minutes somewhere else in the day for
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.360]   your deep work.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.240]   So you fill in that time for
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.600]   undistracted work throughout the day.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.040]   As you fill it in with more meetings, you take more and more time.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.800]   So you leave more flexibility.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.320]   All right, so I said I'd give you two suggestions, Allison,
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.360]   but I'm tired of meetings, so I gave you three.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.520]   Quick summary, add time to your meetings to get closure.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.760]   Two, at the very least, schedule meetings with yourself.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.480]   And three, if you want to block off significant amounts of time to be meeting
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.920]   free, instead of doing that all in advance, do the one for you, one for me method.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.640]   So you can have more flexibility in scheduling meetings with other people,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.800]   but still end up with a fair amount of time blocked off.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.840]   [MUSIC]
