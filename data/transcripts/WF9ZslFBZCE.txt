[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the States, and Pastor Johnny, as you look to
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.640]   him and remember his legacy, he was obviously a profoundly gifted leader.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.840]   Of course, we remember him today for what he accomplished in the Civil Rights Movement.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.200]   And when you look at him solely from a leadership perspective, what stands out to you?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.000]   I mean, what made King such an effective leader?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.240]   He was indeed, and some of us have memories of him while he was living, we're old enough
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   for that.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.200]   And the first thing that I think would be to say his vision.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:48.000]   A leader sees a future, a possible future, and sees it so clearly and can articulate
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   it so well that he's driven by it.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.240]   So he had a vision.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.600]   I have a dream is a signature message that he gave.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000]   Number two would be he was brilliant.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.720]   It helps to be smart if you're going to lead people and discern what makes sense and what
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   doesn't.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.720]   Number three would be he was courageous.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.240]   I mean, he put himself on the line.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.480]   He put his life at risk right to the end when he was snuffed out by a rifle.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.160]   And without courage, you can't lead people through tough times anyway or into hard places
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.200]   where we need to go.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   Another one would be, I think his commitment to nonviolence meant that he had power over
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.040]   his violent enemies.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.880]   Those who took another tack, I don't think had nearly the influence.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.480]   Those who wanted to go a violent route to solve the problem of prejudice and racism
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.600]   in our country and the lack of civil rights didn't have the same effect because you do
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.640]   have a power over your enemies if you are being dragged away to jail without fighting
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.200]   back and without malicious, ugly words while your adversary is sticking their dogs on you
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.560]   and pouring out their fire hoses against you.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.600]   That defeated the racists when Americans saw that.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.680]   Maybe one more would be the time was simply right.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.400]   We sometimes wonder why certain people rise to the head of the pack in terms of leadership
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.600]   and the answer is their time had come.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.120]   God's providence and circumstance just came together and Birmingham and Montgomery just
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.520]   came together at a time when he was thrust, even against his own desires, into a kind
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.360]   of leadership that he couldn't account for.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.480]   I know that there are people who would want me to make sure I balance things by pointing
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   out his flaws and so I'll just say he had them.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   They were serious but even that's a lesson, isn't it?
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:17.960]   That God in his providence uses broken sticks to straighten some lines and so yes, he was
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.360]   an imperfect man, he was a sinful man and that should be known but the knowledge of
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.760]   it doesn't cancel out the amazing good that came through his life and the remarkable gifts
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   that he had.
