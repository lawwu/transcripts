[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.780]   I mentioned Monday that we're in the middle
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.180]   of answering a batch of apologetics questions
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.480]   on the life and work of Christ.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.960]   And today's question is one several of you
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.320]   have asked about over the years, namely this.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.360]   Why did Jesus have to leave earth after the resurrection?
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.560]   Seems like he could do some amazing ministry
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.060]   if he were still here on earth with us.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.400]   That's Dalton's question and he asks it for many of you.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.760]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for the APJ podcast.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.800]   He writes, "A question I have for you is this.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.340]   Why did Jesus leave earth after his resurrection?
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.120]   I understand that Jesus left to leave us the Holy Spirit,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.920]   but couldn't he have just stayed and continue his ministry
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.720]   as the risen Christ in tandem with the spirit?
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   Wouldn't that have been more effective?
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.160]   Why did Christ leave the earth?"
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160]   A question like this can have value
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.440]   if we make it a stepping stone to insight
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.860]   into Christ's present ministry from heaven.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.740]   In other words, if it helps us understand the wisdom
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.740]   and the goodness of what is, is the case
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.940]   and doesn't just become an occasion for curious speculation
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.260]   of what might have been the case.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.740]   So let's tackle Dalton's question that way
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.940]   with that goal in mind.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.940]   So the question is, couldn't Jesus have just stayed
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.900]   on planet earth and continued his ministry
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.820]   after the resurrection and not gone back to heaven
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.100]   as the risen Christ in tandem with alongside
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.300]   the work of the spirit?
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.780]   Wouldn't that have been more effective?
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.640]   He asks, why did Christ leave the earth?
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.900]   Here's a few thoughts.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.900]   Number one, if the risen Christ remained on earth
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   for all of church history, a serious competition
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.620]   would be introduced into global Christianity.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.700]   Who has the risen Christ nearby?
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.660]   He would be spatially bound.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660]   He could not be in one place and another place
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.980]   and another place at the same time.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.660]   And the temptation would always be there to make the place
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.960]   where he was the sacred place.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.820]   His presence would introduce a serious confusion
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.020]   for how Christians are to relate to him.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.220]   Some would be relating to him face to face
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.780]   at any given moment as he visits churches.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.000]   Some would be trying to relate to him by the spirit,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.260]   but put off balance knowing that he's like 100
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.740]   or 10,000 miles away on earth.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.660]   The role of the Holy Spirit in relation to Christ
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.700]   would be confused.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.600]   If his role is to glorify Christ, John 16, 14,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.520]   would we seek the fullness of the spirit
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.300]   in order to experience Christ
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.780]   by the spirit's revelation of him in the gospel?
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.020]   Or would we seek the spirit to bring him,
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.260]   say, from Chicago to Minneapolis?
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.180]   It would, in other words, be a confusing way
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.660]   to go about God's work.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.660]   Number two, Christ's post-resurrection role
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.620]   as the God-man ruling the cosmos
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.640]   is better signified if he's sitting
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.080]   at the right hand of God than walking on the earth.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.940]   And his role as the head of the church
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.880]   would be misrepresented
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.420]   if he were part of the church on earth.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.600]   Here's the key text from Ephesians 1, 20.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.320]   God raised him up from the dead
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.280]   and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.360]   far above all rule and authority and power and dominion
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.440]   and above every name that is named,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.360]   not only in this age, but also in the age to come.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.840]   And he put all things under his feet
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.440]   and gave him as head over all things to the church,
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.680]   This exalted role as above all rule and authority
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.440]   in the universe and as the head of the universal church
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.520]   would be obscured, wouldn't it?
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.320]   It would be obscured if Jesus were still walking among us.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.980]   Number three, the exaltation of Jesus
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.320]   to the right hand of God's majesty
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.180]   is the fitting coronation
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.880]   for his triumphant work on the cross
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.400]   and his new incarnate superiority over angels.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   Hebrews 1, 3, "After making purification for sins,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.000]   he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.680]   having become as much superior to angels
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.060]   as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs."
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.260]   If he had not taken this seat,
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.760]   the greatness of his achievement on the cross
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.600]   and the greatness of his new incarnate superiority
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.240]   would be obscured.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.540]   Number four, the present intercession of Christ
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.920]   at God's right hand would not be rightly exercised
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   or exhibited if Christ were still here among us
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.340]   after the resurrection.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.360]   Romans 8, 33, "Who shall bring any charge
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.680]   against God's elect?
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.440]   It is God who justifies.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.040]   Who is to condemn?
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.320]   Christ Jesus is the one who died
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.800]   more than that who was raised,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.360]   who is indeed at the right hand of God
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.280]   who intercedes for us."
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   So it is fitting that Jesus be in the exalted presence
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.880]   of God as he intercedes for us
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   and brings his sacrifice to bear on our behalf before God.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   Number five, the Holy Spirit that Jesus promised to send
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.160]   when he returned to the Father, John 15, 26,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.120]   is the Spirit of the risen Christ.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.880]   And according to John 7, 39,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   the Spirit of the risen Christ could not come
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.800]   until Christ were completely glorified,
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.020]   which included his ascension to the Father.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.740]   Here's what Jesus said.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.900]   "Now this Jesus said about the Spirit,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.460]   whom those who believed in him were to receive,
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.780]   for as yet the Spirit had not yet been given
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.220]   because Jesus was not yet glorified."
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.660]   So the glorification of Jesus at the right hand of God
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.620]   was essential because the Spirit
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.420]   who would be sent by Jesus and the Father
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.240]   is the Spirit of the glorified Christ.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.260]   Finally, number six,
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.940]   God's plan is that the risen Christ
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.120]   would get great glory at the end of this age,
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   not by itinerating on the earth for 2000 years,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.820]   but by descending from heaven in power and great glory
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.780]   and defeating the man of lawlessness
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.820]   and being marveled at by all his people.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.120]   2 Thessalonians 2,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.800]   "The Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.780]   with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.220]   inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.780]   and on those who do not obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.660]   The man of lawlessness will be revealed,
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.800]   the son of destruction,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.620]   and the Lord Jesus will kill him
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.980]   with the breath of his mouth
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.980]   and bring him to nothing by the appearance of his coming."
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:49.660]   So the second coming of Christ is the great climax
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.680]   of God's way of glorifying his son.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.020]   These are some of the reasons
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.020]   why Jesus did not stay on the earth after the resurrection,
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.260]   and there are many more.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.980]   God's ways are great.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.940]   God's ways are good and wise.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.140]   Let's revel in what he's doing
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.340]   through Christ from heaven.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.180]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.540]   Fascinating points to ponder
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.980]   on why it's better for Christ to not be here.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.940]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that,
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.120]   and thanks for joining us today.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.620]   If you wanna ask Pastor John your best apologetics question,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.420]   type it out and email it to me
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.360]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.580]   Speaking of hard questions,
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.020]   if the consequence for sin is eternal suffering,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.760]   why isn't Christ still suffering on our behalf today?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.440]   Why did he suffer for no more than 33 years?
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.520]   That's another gospel question
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.760]   many of you have asked over the years,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.520]   and one that will showcase for us
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.600]   the glories of who our Savior truly is,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.400]   which we will do to start our next week together.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760]   I'll see you Monday.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
