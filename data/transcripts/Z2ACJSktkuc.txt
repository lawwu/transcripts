[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   I want you to open your Bible to John 6 again, as we did last week.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.480]   As you can tell, the title of the message is the same: "Christian Deconstruction."
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.300]   For many generations of the church, no one would understand what that means.
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.580]   But in this contemporary scenario, maybe over the last five or six years, that has become
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:34.700]   a very popular term to describe people who once professed to be Christians, but who turned
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.580]   away.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.100]   They deconstruct their Christian faith.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.200]   It primarily finds its adherence on the internet through the normal ubiquitous social media
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.520]   means as they give their testimonies.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.520]   To read the Bible, it says, "I am the Son of God, the Father of the world.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.560]   I am the Son of God, the Father of the earth, and I am the Son of God, and I am the Son of
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   the earth."
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.160]   They're being liberated from the oppression that Christianity once was for them.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.000]   This is the typical scene.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.600]   And most of them who defect do so because of an unwillingness to turn from iniquity,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.780]   transgression, and sin, and be obedient to the Lord.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.500]   And it comes down to that.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   True Christians obey and false Christians don't.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.820]   Some Christians resent that.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.740]   And so trying to get a handle on that and help you to see it and understand it, I've
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.280]   chosen John, chapter 6, as a great passage to explain this, because it is a widespread
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280]   phenomenon.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.040]   As I said last week, there are so many false forms of Christianity, so many churches that
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.440]   preach an inadequate gospel, that there's a proliferation of falsehood.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.980]   There's a proliferation of false disciples.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.340]   There is so much sowing tares amidst the wheat that we should not be surprised that there's
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.200]   a lot of deconstruction, because people who aren't genuinely Christian are very likely
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.380]   to at some point abandon whatever profession they made about Christianity to cling to their
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.380]   transgressions.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.380]   There's a...
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.760]   There's an incident here that you would look at and say, "This is a heartbreaking incident,"
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.100]   and you would be right.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.340]   This is defined most clearly by verse 66 of John 6.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.960]   As a result of this, many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.900]   Defecting disciples.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.420]   Very strong language in verse 66, very strong.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.320]   Expressing finality.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:05.800]   This comes strangely, you might think, right at the high point of our Lord's ministry in
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   Galilee.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   He's been doing miracles, particularly in the city of Capernaum where this incident
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   takes place.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   He has been raising people from all manner of illness and disease and demon possession.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.260]   He has proclaimed His deity as the Lord.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.120]   He is the Son of God, and He's demonstrated the validity of the claim by His miracle power.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.080]   And then in this very chapter, He just created food to feed a crowd we would estimate of
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.520]   25,000 people.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.720]   He literally created food out of nothing, a massive, incomprehensible miracle.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.140]   And you would think that after that miracle and all the others that He had done in Capernaum,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.200]   that His disciples would be...
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.700]   They would be locked down on the fact that this is indeed the Son of God, this is indeed
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.940]   the Messiah.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:09.860]   But instead of that, you have this defection, this rebellion, this abandonment.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:20.900]   And while it seems like a horrible moment in human history, it's not uncommon.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.140]   In fact, it's pretty much the pattern.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.020]   Even in biblical history.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.960]   Go back to Deuteronomy, chapter 6, a very familiar chapter.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.080]   The children of Israel are on the edge of going into the Promised Land, and God is giving
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.680]   them instructions.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.860]   They have seen His power.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.000]   They saw His power unleashed in the plagues in Egypt, His protection and deliverance
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.080]   in the wanderings in the wilderness.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:05.220]   They have seen His power on display in creating food, manna from heaven, water from rock.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.960]   They have seen the power of God.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.200]   And now it's time for them to go into the land.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   They have been given the Ten Commandments and other commands.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.900]   And here is what the Lord expects from them, chapter 6 of Deuteronomy.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.020]   We'll begin at the beginning of the chapter.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.920]   Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.940]   has commanded Me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you are going over
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.440]   to possess it, so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the Lord your God
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.360]   to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command you all the days of your life,
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.200]   that your days may be prolonged.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.960]   O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that it may be well.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.780]   Be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, just as the Lord the God of your fathers
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.780]   has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.140]   Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.000]   You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.180]   might.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.020]   These words I am commanding you today, and they shall be on your heart.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.900]   You shall teach them diligently to your sons, and shall talk of them when you sit in your
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.900]   house and when you walk by the way.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.500]   And when you lie down and when you rise up - " in other words, all the time " - bind
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.740]   them as a sign on your hand, so that even the work that you do is interpreted by these
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.560]   commands.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.200]   They shall be as frontals on your forehead, that your thoughts even are filtered by these
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.280]   commands.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.420]   And even write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, so that in your going
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.280]   in and going out you are always reminded of these commands."
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   Now in verse 17 of that same chapter, "You should diligently keep the commandments of
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.700]   the Lord your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.380]   You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.060]   you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which the Lord swore to give to
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.460]   your fathers."
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.460]   And this continues.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.940]   If you drop down to verse 24: "So the Lord commanded us to observe the good land which
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.940]   the Lord swore to give to your fathers."
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.940]   And this continues.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.440]   For example, chapter 7, verse 11: "Therefore you shall keep the commandment and the statutes
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.320]   and the judgments which I am commanding you today to do them."
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.120]   Verse 12: "Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep and
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.060]   do them, that the Lord your God will keep with you His covenant and His lovingkindness
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.000]   which He swore to your forefathers."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.940]   Even into chapter 8, verse 1: "All the commandments that I am commanding you today
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.360]   you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.860]   land which the Lord swore to give to your forefathers."
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.060]   Again just constantly repeating the necessity of obedience.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.220]   A couple of more, chapter 8, verse 11: "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.700]   not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.700]   today."
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.940]   Verse 19: "It shall come about, if you ever forget
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:03.060]   the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.160]   against you today that you will surely perish.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.080]   Like the nations that the Lord makes to perish before you, so you shall perish, because you
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.180]   would not listen to the voice of the Lord your God."
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.940]   Now, I took my time in going through that because I want
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.260]   you to understand one dominant theme there, and that is that your relationship to God,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:36.800]   whether you're Israel of old or the professing people of God in the modern era, your responsibility
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.320]   to God is defined by obeying His words, His commands.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.900]   It's not a sentimental relationship; it's a relationship of specific commands and specific
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.360]   obedience.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   So what happened?
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.500]   They went into the Promised Land.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.940]   Did the nation Israel obey?
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.940]   No.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.940]   Did they love the Lord their God with all their heart, soul, strength?
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.940]   No.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.440]   Did they keep His commandments?
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440]   No.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.540]   And so the rest of the history going through the Old Testament features God's reaction
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.540]   to their disobedience.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:19.500]   A good illustration of their defection is found in Jeremiah, chapter 2, where Jeremiah,
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.940]   indicting obviously the unfaithful.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.940]   "Behold, I will not let you go to the land of the wicked."
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.940]   Why?
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.940]   Because the word "fraud" is a word that is used in the Old Testament to describe the
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.200]   people who are not faithful to God.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.940]   The word "fraud" is a word that is used to describe the people who are not faithful to
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.940]   God.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.940]   The word "fraud" is a word that is used to describe the people who are not faithful to
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.940]   God.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.940]   The word "fraud" is a word that is used to describe the people who are not faithful
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940]   to God.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   The word "fraud" is a word that is used to describe the people who are not faithful to
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.940]   God.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.940]   The word "fraud" is a word that is used to describe the people who are not faithful

[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.940]   God.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.180]   "We know you, the Holy One of God," the demon said.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.140]   "We know who you are.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.900]   You are the Holy One of God.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.940]   You have come from heaven.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:48.940]   Your words have eternal life."
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.540]   And so we believe.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.700]   If you're a false disciple, you reject the words.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:03.060]   If you're a true disciple, you love the words.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.900]   Amen.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:11.200]   "Because they are eternal life."
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.820]   And that's the difference.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:19.480]   And then in the end of this little section, Jesus answers them and said, "Did I Myself
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.520]   not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?"
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.800]   Now He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Him.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.860]   We're not allowed to dwell on Peter's confession very long, actually.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:41.740]   Only a brief pause before we face the pathos that dominates this moment.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:51.800]   Judas, the archetypal false disciple, is exposed.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:46:01.020]   Judas didn't believe the words that Jesus spoke, had no interest in Jesus or in obeying
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.820]   His commands.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.140]   Judas wanted temporal things.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.260]   And when Jesus didn't deliver, he wanted to get out.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:17.220]   And since he'd wasted three years of his life, he wanted to get out with some money at least.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.060]   So he started stealing from the small treasury.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:32.400]   The materialist, no interest in the words, even though he saw who he was, so adept at
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.780]   hypocrisy.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:44.020]   The disciples didn't know until he was exposed in the upper room about six months after this.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:49.540]   And this is Jesus' way of sort of closing this narrative and saying, "You're going to
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.820]   face this, and it's going to come at very high levels.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:47:03.740]   A disciple, one of the twelve, a pastor of a church, the head of a Christian institution,
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:04.740]   but understand, I know who they are.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.740]   I know who they are."
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.740]   But understand, I know who they are.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:07.740]   I know who they are.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   I know who they are.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.740]   There's a sadness in this that is resolved really theologically.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   Why do I say that?
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   Go back to verse 65.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   Here's where Jesus rests at this sad reality of being a disciple of the Father.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   "I know who they are.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.740]   I know who they are.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.740]   I know who they are.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   I know who they are."
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.740]   And then he says, "I know who they are."
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.740]   He's saying, "I know who they are."
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.740]   He's saying, "I know who they are."
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.740]   He's saying, "I know who they are."
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   He's saying, "I know who they are."
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.740]   He's saying, "I know who they are."
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:37.000]   Here's where Jesus rests at this sad reality of defection.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.580]   He was saying, "For this reason I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:48.980]   has been granted him from the Father."
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:52.700]   That is a powerful statement.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:59.240]   This salvation is all a work of God.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:09.640]   Go back to verse 37 of John 6: "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me."
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:18.780]   Verse 44: "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him."
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.660]   And here for the third time he says the same thing.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:30.900]   "No one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father."
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:41.340]   This is where you resolve this in God's sovereign will, in God's sovereign will.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:50.580]   The bottom line for you and for all of us is do you believe, right?
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.620]   Some of you have not believed.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:58.060]   Some of you don't believe the words, the words of the gospel, the words of sanctification,
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.100]   the words of truth.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:07.860]   But others of you believe, and for you the word is life.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:20.160]   But in the end, we rest it all in the Father's will so that Christ will accomplish redemption.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.580]   He will build His church.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:30.700]   That's the divine design, and it will come to pass.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:39.580]   Our Father, we are grateful again for the word that gives life.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.540]   We have experienced that life.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:52.540]   We know it to be a profound, transformational life so that we are new creations in Christ.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.700]   We receive that eternal life.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:50:03.600]   Lord, I pray that You would move on the hearts of any who are here who have come partway,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.540]   but not all the way to Christ.
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:13.640]   May they not harden their hearts as they did in the Old Testament.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.700]   May they come all the way to Christ.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:22.500]   May You draw them, O Father, for Your glory, and help us to know that the mark of discipleship
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.500]   is obedience.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   And it's not an obedience out of fear; it's an obedience out of love.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   It's an obedience that we cherish and that we enjoy and that we love.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   With David, we say, "O, how I love Your law!"
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.500]   We love You, and that love compels our obedience.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.260]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:48.960]   With David, we say, "O, how I love Your law!"
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.220]   We love You, and that love compels our obedience.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:59.220]   We love Your law, which is a righteous manifestation of Your nature, which we love as well.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.960]   May all of us examine our heart to see whether we're in the faith.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.460]   And we know that if we love You.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.520]   That's why You said to Peter three times, "Do You love Me?"
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.640]   And if we love You, we manifest that by obedience.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:25.300]   Not perfect obedience, but heartfelt, continuous, faithful obedience under the power of Your
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.300]   Spirit.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:32.060]   We're grateful for the calling from heaven that the Father extended to us who believe.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:38.420]   May we be faithful in following, and may we be faithful in proclaiming the glorious gospel,
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   and may we be faithful in our faith.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   And we love You, and we love Your law.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   We love You, and we love Your God.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name, and we love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:50.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.420]   May we be faithful in our faith, and may we be faithful in our faith.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:02.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.420]   We love You, and we love Your holy name.
