[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Intro]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Today is absolutely epic, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.280]   This is episode number 300 in the Ask Pastor John podcast series.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.760]   Episode 100, if I remember correctly, was a little less epic.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.720]   Episode 200, I think, was pretty epic.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.440]   But this is episode 300, and it is truly epic because today is the first round of March
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.240]   Madness, which begins in Dayton, Ohio.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.400]   And Pastor John, here is the question that millions and millions of people around the
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.920]   world want to ask you right now.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   Why, Pastor John, why do we love watching March Madness basketball?
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.760]   Okay, I'm the least likely person to say anything about college basketball.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   But here goes.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.120]   I enjoy watching college basketball.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.000]   Yes, I do.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.840]   More than football because there are no breaks between the plays.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.080]   The action is fast-paced, more than professional basketball because their hearts seem to be
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.000]   in it more, and more than baseball.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880]   I don't want to offend you, Tony.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.120]   I know you're a big baseball guy, but to me, that sport is just painfully slow.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.280]   And I have to admit, it's evidently the intelligent man's sport, but I'm not intelligent enough
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.040]   to be thinking deep thoughts about what might be coming with this pitch and what has happened.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.160]   I'm saying, come on, come on, come on, get on with it.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.400]   So anyway, I enjoy college basketball.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.640]   Why?
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.680]   And I think I'm probably typical in enjoying it.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360]   I'm going to download probably the NAAC, that's not right.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.160]   That's the African American group, right?
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.160]   NCAA.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.420]   NCAA, yeah, sorry.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.120]   So anyway, I'm going to download their app because last year I knew they had an app and
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.000]   you could listen to every one of them free, unlike these crazy Olympic apps that don't
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   let you watch anything.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   So I don't have a television and I want to watch, so there's the app that'll let me peek
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   in.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.080]   Why do we like to watch this sport?
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.040]   Number one, we, I want to say we, love to see great skill.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.440]   It's a form of beauty.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.840]   We're wired to enjoy beauty.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.640]   That's the way God made us.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.080]   Mainly so we can enjoy his beauty and all of its refractions in creation.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.680]   And there are refractions of his created beauty in college basketball.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.840]   There is individual artistry and beauty, the dribbling, the shooting.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.260]   We love to watch the phenomenal dribbling around, around the opposition that drives
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.600]   and finishes smooth two points.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.040]   And by the way, I don't value dunking.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.760]   I don't like to watch dunking to me.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.600]   Dunking is not very artistic.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   It seems to be like it's mainly height and Hulk.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.480]   Whereas an artistic smooth layup in an old traditional way, that's a lot more art about
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.440]   it than the smoshing dunks from halfway down the court.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.520]   It is pretty amazing, but it's just not as artistic.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.480]   Second, there's team beauty, not just individual, but team beauty.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.400]   When a defense is simply impregnable or an offense maneuvers so beautifully successfully,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.880]   it looks like one single organism.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.840]   And the best of all is when the individual and the team combine so that the players shine
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   at their peak performances, but they're actually serving the coordinated effort of the team.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.120]   So all of that beauty falls under what I would say that the reason we like that sort of thing
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.360]   is the beauty of art, the artistic skill of players and teams.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.800]   This is a God given ability, and it points the way to the way God is in his abilities.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.960]   He's beautiful in his skill, in his skill giving wisdom.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.640]   Here's a second one I enjoy, I admire endurance.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.440]   I love to watch sports that require enormous endurance.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.560]   I love perseverance in real life.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.360]   People that do something through thick and thin for decades and accomplish much by little
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.960]   steps, you know, like chopping down a huge thousand year old tree with a little teeny
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.040]   axe because you've hacked at it every day for 50 years.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.440]   That's a glorious thing for me.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.000]   So I love endurance and I love sports that keep men running or working like the Tour
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.040]   de France or soccer or basketball that just keeps they run and they run and they run till
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   they drop.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.360]   I mean, I've played enough basketball and enough soccer to know this is incredible or
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.720]   biking for two weeks at hundreds of miles a day.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.480]   I mean, I just stand in awe because I admire perseverance in every legal sphere, especially
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.800]   in the relationship with God where we have to persevere every day.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   And the third thing I would say is I love to see David slay Goliath.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   I asked my wife about this.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.800]   Why does she enjoy basketball?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.680]   And she said, "Me?
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   I don't."
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.880]   And I said, "Why do you think people do?"
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.560]   And she said, "Because they like to pull for their favorite teams."
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   And I said, "Oh, I didn't even think of that because I don't have any favorite teams.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.840]   I don't have anything invested at all in this."
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.240]   And if that's what people are thinking about, I'll just leave that for others to talk about.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.040]   But what I do love is when a big cocky team, I'm tempted to name some names here, but I
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.080]   won't, gets taken down by this little college that nobody's ever heard of.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.320]   I mean, there's glory in that because I love the biblical model that through weakness and
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.480]   smallness great evils are undone.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:12.200]   And the last thing I would say is that we enjoy this, college basketball, March Madness,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:20.260]   and other sports because the pressure is off of us and onto them, and we're relaxing, right?
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.080]   We're sitting on our couch.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.860]   We've put in a hard day.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.240]   We've bent our brains to accomplish as much as we could in God's will, doing what he wants
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   us to do.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.920]   We're tired, and it just feels good not to have to make this play happen.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.200]   I am not the coach.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   I'm not responsible for this.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.280]   I am not the key player.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.760]   I don't have to make that basket at the buzzer.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.840]   I'm just enjoying there acting with skill under pressure.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:59.080]   In other words, sports have a unwinding, relaxing, appropriate function in the life of hardworking
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   Christians.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.240]   So if my wife is right and the reason you watch is just because you want your team to
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.400]   win, I don't know how to relate to you.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.680]   Okay, so will you fill out a bracket?
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.600]   No, I don't have a clue how to do that.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Excellent.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.160]   Oh, folks, so be encouraged.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.840]   All of you who can fill out a March Madness bracket but cannot arc the book of Romans,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.720]   there is hope for all of us.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.220]   Well, speaking of impregnable defenses, you don't want to miss seeing Pastor John suffocating
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.760]   defense on display by checking out a short video titled T4G 2012 Teaser, The Game.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.040]   You can find it if you Google it, T4G 2012 Teaser, The Game.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   There right at the beginning, at about the six-second mark, you will witness his shutdown
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.200]   defense on display.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   No joke.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.520]   And speaking of phenomenal dribbling around opposition and smooth finishes to the hoop,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.360]   at about the 30-second mark, you'll see that on display as well.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.640]   All right, we need to shut down this epic podcast before it gets even more out of hand.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.000]   So I'll sign off with the wise words of a Major League Baseball Hall of Famer, one Leo
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.320]   Durocher, who once said this, "Baseball is like church.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.000]   Many attend, but few understand."
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.300]   [END]
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   Leo Durocher, "Baseball is like church."
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.300]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.300]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.300]   [END]
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   Leo Durocher, "Baseball is like church."
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.300]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.300]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:30.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
