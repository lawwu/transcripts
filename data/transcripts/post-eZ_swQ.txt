[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   John is a CFP, a principal at Cornerstone Wealth Advisors,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.080]   where he's a fee-only financial planner and manages wealth.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.800]   He serves as a retirement columnist
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.120]   for the Journal of Financial Planning
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.080]   and a Wall Street Journal expert panelist on retirement.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.060]   He's an award-winning thought leader and researcher
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.960]   on sustainable withdrawal policies,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.800]   retirement income planning,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.500]   and the application of behavioral finance principles
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.760]   in working with clients.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.300]   And he's even created the profession's first
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.300]   multi-year residency in financial planning.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300]   Christine Benz probably needs no introduction to you.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.940]   Our fearless leader, she is the chairman of the board
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.940]   of the Bogle Center.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.100]   She also has a new book out, if you haven't seen it,
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.260]   "How to Retire."
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.940]   I can't tell you to go buy it, since this is Bogle Eds
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.860]   and we're not supposed to have, you know,
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.540]   those sorts of conflicts of interest.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.700]   But I can tell you to go talk to your librarian
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.100]   and talk them into buying it,
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.160]   and then you can borrow it from the library.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.900]   But as you know, Christine Benz is the director
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.180]   of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.100]   And of course, the author of this great new book
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.000]   and our chair and our fearless leader.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.860]   Let's give a big round of applause to both of them.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.740]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.980]   - Okay, awesome.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.740]   John, thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.460]   You know, you are one of my favorite people to talk to
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.220]   about all this stuff, because you are a practitioner,
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.260]   you work with clients, and you've also been a researcher.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.800]   So you just bring so much knowledge to bear
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   and so much humanity to bear on these topics.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.840]   I wanted to talk to you about your famous research
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   about taking dynamic portfolio withdrawals in retirement.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.220]   You hit on this approach
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.320]   that's been called the guardrails approach.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.880]   I think maybe you called it that.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.440]   But maybe you can talk about your original intuition.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.060]   Bill Bengen is here and we're delighted to see him.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.080]   But you wanted to build upon Bill's seminal research
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.320]   with your work.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.160]   So maybe talk about your intuition
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.120]   in wanting to investigate a variable
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.960]   or flexible withdrawal system.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840]   - Sure, and let me just first say,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.480]   welcome to Minneapolis, my hometown.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180]   It's great to have you all here.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.640]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   You may not know it, but according to WalletHub,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.240]   this is the third best city in the country
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   in which to retire, even with our high taxes.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.840]   So a little bit of new news for this week.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.000]   But I appreciate that question, Christine,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.200]   and it's great to have this chat with you.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.160]   It was a little over 20 years ago.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.480]   We were working with a client.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.220]   They had recently retired.
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.000]   It was in the early days
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.960]   of what we would come to call the dot-com bubble.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   We didn't quite know it was a bubble bursting yet.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.080]   We had done the normal Monte Carlo simulations,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.660]   presented them their retirement plan.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.440]   They were newly retired.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.020]   And we said, well, and you have an 85% chance of success.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.460]   And one of the couple looked at me and said,
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.460]   well, how do we know whether we're gonna be in the 85
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.680]   that makes it or the 15 that doesn't?
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.980]   And I said, well, we can make some adjustments
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.680]   along the way.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.840]   And they said, well, how will we know
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.980]   if the adjustments we make are the right ones?
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.000]   And I was starting to feel really uncomfortable
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.840]   at this point.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680]   And I thought, I really don't like these answers.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.560]   And so, Bill, it was 30 years ago this year
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.960]   that Bill's initial work came out.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.880]   I mean, that's a really big deal.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.800]   And to have asked the question 30 years ago
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.400]   that is still the right question is huge.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   And to set that platform that everything comes upon.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.380]   And one of the things that struck me
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.440]   in thinking about this was,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.780]   by the time people are retired,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.100]   they've gone through a lot of changes
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.440]   in their financial lives.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.960]   In a nutshell, they've learned how to be flexible.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.520]   Some years, income is higher.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.600]   Some years, it's lower.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.580]   Spending is up.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.000]   Spending is down.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.420]   And would it make any difference
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.640]   if we applied or allowed for some of that flexibility
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.800]   in what would be sustainable?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.640]   And I guess if the answer had turned out to be
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.840]   that it doesn't make any difference at all,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.780]   then I wouldn't be here today.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.040]   But it turns out that it does.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   And so that was really the start
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.520]   of what became dynamic withdrawal policies.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.400]   - That's super helpful.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.840]   And I also wanted to mention
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.000]   that we will be taking your questions.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.080]   So you'll see some,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.960]   I should have cards on your table,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.180]   but if you have some paper,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.100]   write out your question.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.100]   We'll have someone walking around
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.300]   who can pick up your question
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.020]   and we'll be going through them.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.500]   We'll leave about 15 minutes for questions.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.660]   And that pertains to this whole afternoon today.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.740]   We'll be handling questions in that same way.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.460]   So John, in my book, which you are interviewed in,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.060]   we talk about this whole dynamic system.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.180]   And you used a metaphor that I thought
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.940]   was such a beautiful way of illustrating
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.020]   what is going on with dynamic withdrawals in retirement.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.000]   And you compared it to a road trip
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.760]   that setting out on retirement is kind of like a road trip.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.640]   Can you talk about that here?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.040]   - Sure, because this is very conceptual stuff.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.960]   And so finding a way that kind of relates it,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.520]   like you said, metaphorically can sometimes be helpful.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.720]   And so what struck me was,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.400]   if you think about a road trip
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.280]   where the car is like everything in your life,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.400]   it's your financial wellbeing, it's your health,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.200]   it's your relationships, your family,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.360]   it's your bucket list.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.000]   The fuel, if you will,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.560]   is what your portfolio and your resources are able to do.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.920]   You might think of it as your allocation, for instance.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.640]   And then the speed that you go
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.520]   is the rate of withdrawal that comes out.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.120]   And so the idea is that when you're on this road trip,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.440]   hopefully it's nice, wonderful, sunny days
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.600]   like we have today.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.240]   But we all know that sometimes we're gonna get weather.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.800]   It might rain, the road could get icy,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.880]   you might have a hard time with visibility.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.720]   You could actually be in danger at some point
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.120]   and not even know it.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.640]   So when you're in that situation
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.040]   where you need to tap the brakes,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.480]   where you want to be aware of your surroundings,
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.240]   sometimes you actually do need there to be a guardrail
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.360]   that will put a little ding in your car,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.880]   but get you back into a more safe place along the road.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.160]   And that's really how the term came about,
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.000]   is it puts in place things that kind of help you
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.520]   make those real-time adjustments along the way,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.120]   if they're necessary,
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.880]   based on a withdrawal plan that you're following.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.720]   - You made the point to me
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.000]   that the idea of taking withdrawals down
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.600]   if my portfolio is not performing well
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.560]   and maybe giving myself a raise
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.360]   in a bigger market environment
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.520]   is one of the rare sort of things
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.760]   that feels good behaviorally
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.800]   and also is the right thing to do
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.600]   from the portfolio perspective
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.560]   and its sustainability over my retirement time horizon.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.400]   Talk about that.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.520]   I think that's so interesting
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.920]   because it's not the same as a lot of other
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.520]   behavioral sort of mistakes
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.440]   that we might make with our portfolios.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.480]   - Isn't that the truth where there's an impetus
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.800]   in lots of places to save later,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.680]   spend now, sell low, buy high,
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   and all of that.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.400]   And here's a situation where
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.800]   if market conditions are not good,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.880]   if your portfolio value is going well,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.240]   that those human instincts, fear, really, if you will,
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.440]   cause you to wonder, maybe we should pull back.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.760]   Maybe we should slow down spending a little bit
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.800]   in a certain area.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.820]   And hopefully, with whatever withdrawal strategy
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.040]   someone is following,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   they are able to make good decisions,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.260]   do what they need to do when they should,
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.120]   but not do more than they need to do in that way
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.840]   before it's necessary.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   - So let's talk about why using a dynamic strategy
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.360]   can help elevate starting portfolio withdrawals
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.920]   and then really elevate lifetime portfolio withdrawals,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.220]   which is something that we've seen in our research
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.840]   on the topic at Morningstar.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.060]   Maybe you could just talk about sort of the mechanics,
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.160]   why that does give you a bigger payout
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.760]   if you're okay with this trade-off
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.680]   of adjusting up and down.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.520]   - Well, sure.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.880]   I mean, if you, like with Bill in the room,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.480]   I mean, the original paper there looked at different years
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.800]   you could retire.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.720]   And what became known as the 4% rule
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.520]   was because, well, that was the lowest
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.680]   that it ever was that always succeeded.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.960]   And so I think we all know that in a course of retirement,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.280]   if you have normal market conditions,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.520]   you can take out more money.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.600]   The reason why a given withdrawal strategy
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.240]   has a withdrawal rate as low as it is
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.000]   is because it's kind of taking care
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.760]   of the worst case scenario,
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.320]   and you might not get the worst case scenario.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.680]   And so along the way,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.880]   if you get in, what dynamic policies really do
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.720]   is say, let's start as though things
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.520]   are gonna be kind of like normal.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.560]   And if it turns out to be worse than that,
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.340]   you've signed up for the ability to be flexible,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.320]   where you kind of scale things down along the way.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.440]   That's just one way to look at things.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.880]   Obviously, if people don't want those adjustments,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.120]   it's a little bit, to go back to the car analogy,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.360]   like saying, well, I'm gonna take my road trip and drive,
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.200]   but I'm gonna get rid of all the mirrors and the brakes
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.720]   because I'm not allowed to change anything.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.760]   Every year I get a raise for inflation,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.000]   come hell or high water,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.900]   and it doesn't matter if it's raining or icy or whatever,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.000]   I'm just gonna keep going along that way.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.680]   So I don't know, if I'm gonna travel that way,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.580]   I think I'm gonna go a little slower.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.740]   - That's helpful.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.440]   There's a great post on bogleheads.org
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.560]   that I think the title is,
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.660]   Explain Guyton-Klinger to Me Like I'm Five.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.680]   And it's such a great discussion
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.800]   because you've said it's not complicated,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.600]   but I think that there are some rules there in place
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.880]   if someone is implementing the guardrails approach.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.560]   So maybe you can walk through a basic example
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.360]   of how this would work using an illustration
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.080]   of maybe what the starting withdrawal would be
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.720]   with the bands upward and downward.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.560]   - Sure.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.880]   One of the things that we kind of assume
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.240]   is that people want to pay attention
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.180]   to how things are going.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.760]   You know, you look at your statement,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.720]   you look at your rate of return,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.360]   you look at how much you're taking out,
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.240]   you can calculate what your withdrawal percentage is.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.680]   And so, I mean, even without guardrails,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.840]   you still have to know all those things
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.240]   so you can apply an inflation factor.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.960]   And so under the guardrails approach,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.720]   what we say is, well, that's exactly what you do, unless.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.240]   And that's where the ranges come in, it's the unless.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.920]   And so the first thing is that if you have a year
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.840]   with a negative portfolio return,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.000]   then the next year you just don't give yourself a raise.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.080]   And then you say, but if it turns out
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.320]   that the raise I would have given myself
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   pushes my withdrawal percentage up by more than 20%,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.520]   then you have to take your medicine.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.240]   And then because you started
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.000]   with that higher withdrawal percentage,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.840]   I think in the recent Morningstar study,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.520]   it was the difference between like about 5.3 and 3.8.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.080]   That's a big difference.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.680]   So you got to back off that a little bit
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.480]   and lower what you're taking out,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.080]   what you would have gotten with your raise
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.880]   for inflation by 20%.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.840]   And then the opposite also holds,
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.760]   as you pointed out, Christine,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   that if markets are good and your portfolio value is growing
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.920]   even as you're taking money out of it
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.120]   so that your withdrawal percentage is going down,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   if that percentage drops 20%,
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.640]   then you're entitled to move the whole thing up by 10%
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.400]   above what inflation would have been
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.080]   and just keep going on from there.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960]   So it works both ways.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.800]   - Okay.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   Wanted to talk to you about something
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.920]   I've been kind of shorthanding is permission to spend,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.000]   that it's been my experience that some older adults
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.760]   who have been good savers, who identify as savers
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.800]   and investors, it's really difficult for them
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.240]   to flip that switch to actually start spending
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.600]   from their portfolios.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.920]   And I think I'm going to be one of these people
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.240]   who has trouble with that.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.560]   So maybe you can talk about working with clients.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.760]   I assume that it probably gives them peace
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.320]   that you're a professional, you're saying this will be okay,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.900]   but do you have any kind of techniques
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.400]   to help people over that hump of getting comfortable
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.080]   with spending from their portfolio
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.360]   and not just anchoring on their high watermark
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.800]   and never wanting to see it go lower?
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.680]   - Well, we're humans.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.600]   So of course we anchor and we do things like that.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.800]   You know, I was, you had shared
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.000]   you were going to ask this question.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.280]   I was thinking about it.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.320]   And one of the things we've learned
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.840]   from working with retirees, and I have to say,
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.640]   I think we're a lot better.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.520]   And frankly, anyone who does what I do,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.400]   hopefully is also a lot better at what they do
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.320]   because of what their retired clients have taught them,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.520]   what they've learned by watching them
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.040]   go through this process and through this transition.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.360]   So we have a saying that's like,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.520]   well, you know, when you retire, you've never done it before.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.120]   You've read about it, you've thought about it,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.920]   you've planned for it, you've never done it.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.240]   There is always a leap involved
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.440]   and maybe just acknowledging that.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.100]   You know, you're excited about this, you're ready for it,
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.340]   you want to do it, you have these, you know,
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.840]   let's call them irrational trepidations,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.920]   but people are not spreadsheets.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.240]   And even though the spreadsheet says you're going to be fine
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.080]   or whatever other measure you're using,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.720]   just acknowledging and saying there is going to be a leap.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   And whether there's a professional helping you
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.600]   or you're just, you know, interacting with people,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.680]   you know, through your, you know,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.960]   the communities that you're in online,
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.520]   chatting, things like that,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.080]   just to know that that's there
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.980]   may be the most helpful thing there.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.140]   And sometimes for people, they're not ready to retire
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.360]   and that resistance is maybe something
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.800]   they want to pay more attention to until they are.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.400]   - I wanted to ask about this idea.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.200]   We had a conversation and you said,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.760]   so something like travel,
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.460]   you don't want a 4% your travel budget.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.280]   You want a travel pot.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.880]   And I know that's something that you give your clients
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.160]   kind of a discretionary pot.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.840]   Can you talk about how that works
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.320]   and how that sounds like it would kind of sit side by side
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.080]   with my inflexible spending,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.960]   but maybe just walk us through the logistics of that
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.600]   and why you think that's a good way to operate.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.200]   - Sure, and this was another thing
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.880]   that we learned from watching clients.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.420]   It literally came out of a client that when they retired,
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.540]   we were concerned that their extra spending
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.420]   over and above what they told us
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.680]   and we knew their kind of their normal baseline
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.760]   was there was going to run them out of money.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.040]   And we said, we got to have a way to frame this
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.940]   so that they can make informed decisions along the way.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.480]   So this really starts by understanding
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   what we call your core lifetime spending is.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.100]   That stuff in your lifestyle
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.800]   that needs to be sustained for as long as you live.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.220]   And I'm not just talking about Spartan things.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.840]   I'm a lover of good wine
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.180]   and I suspect that I'm going to lose a lot of abilities
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.640]   to do a lot of things before I'm going to lose the ability
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.400]   to have a good glass of wine.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.800]   So that wine budget is a core spending item for me
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.640]   and I'm seeing the nods and the smiles
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.480]   and I'm sure you all have things like that
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.240]   that are ongoing pieces of your quality of life.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   It's important to understand
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.880]   what that sustainable number adds up to.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.280]   And then of course you get healthcare spending,
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.520]   Medicare, your supplement taxes.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.600]   And so you end up with a gross number
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.360]   that's really the baseline that you want to sustain.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.800]   And that's going to be funded
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.640]   with social security and/or pension.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.200]   And then withdrawals that you can literally figure out
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.380]   how much capital you need to go with those other pieces
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.920]   that you're going to follow the rules
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.680]   that you're going to commit to
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.560]   and that you'll then say this is what this month,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.760]   this part of our assets are there for.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.600]   Maybe if someone saved $3 million
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.720]   and by the time they do that calculation
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   that core spending portfolio needs to be 1.7 million.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.920]   And it can be very freeing to know
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.840]   that that's the job of that 1.7 million.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.820]   And the other 1.3 is really unallocated.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.320]   It can be for things that aren't in your list
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.400]   and that's where the travel piece comes in.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.860]   Let's just say that a couple,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.940]   let's say it's a married couple
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.240]   and they say, you know, we'd really like, we're 65,
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.600]   you know, we would love to spend $500,000 on travel
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.540]   until we're not able to do this anymore.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.280]   You know, so if you go,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.240]   well, how do we think about that 500,000?
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.800]   Well, if you 4% it, you know, that's 20,000 a year.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.720]   That doesn't sound like enough fun.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.400]   And furthermore, the travel you want to do,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.820]   given what you envisioned for your family
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.800]   and places you want to go,
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.420]   it's not going to be $20,000 every year.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.640]   So there's already tension there.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.920]   The next thing you could do is you could amortize it.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.160]   You could say, well, let's give ourselves 20 years.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.720]   Let's apply a rate of return.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.040]   Let's run the numbers and let's,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.400]   and we, you know, if we spend 40,000 a year,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.080]   then we'll run this 500 out of money in 20 years
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.960]   that are, you know, at a 5% return.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.160]   And that's kind of, that's a better guideline,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.520]   but maybe some years it'll be more,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.920]   maybe some years it'll be less.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.640]   And so what we encourage clients to do is to set aside
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.960]   or to mental accounting wise,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.640]   to use a behavioral heuristic that,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.320]   and sometimes we even like subdivide accounts
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.420]   to create these pots of money
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.060]   so that people can measure it and see what's left,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.500]   what they've done.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.580]   It's just really all about how you organize things
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.140]   so that you can keep track of the progress you're making
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.140]   and the goals that you have for yourself.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.980]   - That's helpful.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.600]   I wanted to ask about a less happy expense,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.120]   long-term care expenses.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.380]   Perhaps you can talk about how you approach that
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.260]   with your clients.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.340]   I'm guessing your clients,
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.460]   sort of in terms of their level of assets,
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.920]   probably mirror a lot of the folks in the room.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.800]   So maybe you can talk about how you factor that
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.680]   into the retirement spending plan.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   Maybe setting aside someone who has insurance,
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.460]   but the self-funder,
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.740]   the person who plans to pay out of pocket,
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.800]   how should they deal with it
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   and how should the money get invested?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.640]   - Sure.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.900]   Well, first of all, if someone,
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.360]   when they retire, it's like,
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.480]   we're gonna need almost all the money we've saved
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.160]   to fund that core spending.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.240]   There are good candidates
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.540]   to have some long-term care insurance.
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.740]   Now, people often forget
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.560]   that the income that they're living on
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.920]   that's creating the lifestyle that they have today
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.560]   is still gonna be coming in
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.720]   when you're in that much less happy long-term care situation.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.440]   And if you're paying out of pocket,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.680]   you're gonna get a lot of medical expenses
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.280]   on your tax return.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.680]   So if you're going to self-insure,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.400]   having it be pre-tax money is a great way to do it
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.280]   'cause you pull it out,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.740]   it goes on your tax return,
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.980]   and pretty much everything you're spending for
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.540]   goes right there on Schedule A in terms of a deduction.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.440]   We just went through this with my dad
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.200]   and it worked exactly that way.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.320]   And if someone's 65 years old,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.800]   and of course things can happen at any time,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.040]   but you feel like it's most likely
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.720]   that we're not gonna be in this situation
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.060]   for 15 to 20 years,
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.440]   that money might even be invested more aggressively
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.680]   than kind of your overall retirement portfolio
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.060]   'cause it's a little bit like a college fund
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.780]   for a three-year-old.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.500]   You might need it to pay out over a five or four,
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.100]   five or six-year period,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.660]   but the odds are you're not gonna need
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.980]   to start drawing on it for a while,
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.560]   so why not be more aggressive with that?
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.620]   - Wanted to switch over to talk about portfolio management
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.600]   and maybe let's stick with withdrawals,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.300]   but in terms of the where of those withdrawals,
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.440]   I feel like this has been a really under-discussed aspect
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.280]   of this whole thing,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.600]   and Guardrails actually gets into some rules
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.160]   about if you need cash flows from your portfolio
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.840]   because you're retired,
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.360]   where should you go for them based on market conditions?
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.000]   So maybe talk about how you think about that
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.600]   and how you implement that in clients' plans.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.040]   - Well, the first thing I wanna say on this,
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.760]   this is a really big topic,
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.000]   and as you identify, it's an important one,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.680]   and you just can't underestimate the importance
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.000]   of good tax planning, the RMDs that are involved.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.900]   We have new rules, recently new rules under the SECURE Act,
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.520]   and so having it, first of all,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.720]   having an understanding of how our tax bracket structure
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.960]   works at the federal level makes a big difference.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.940]   You know, we have seven income tax brackets,
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.480]   but some of them are very close to each other,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.100]   like 22 and then 24, and then you get big jumps.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.480]   There are two big jumps in that.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.320]   So, you know, as you look at your family situation
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.760]   and you think about those marginal tax rates,
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.280]   you think about IRMA, and since this is a 501 series,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.960]   I'm not gonna define what IRMA is,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.480]   and you end up with that, those additional Medicare premiums
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.840]   and it's effectively a tax,
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.360]   it's really important to think about, you know,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.000]   where are you gonna get the money you need
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.240]   from a tax standpoint,
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.760]   knowing that you've got several different scenarios
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.240]   that are gonna affect what that tax rate is.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.080]   If it's a married couple, you know,
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.800]   they're the years when you're filing jointly.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.600]   Then, more likely than not,
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.320]   there's gonna be a period of time
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.520]   where one is a surviving spouse
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.240]   and files as an individual taxpayer.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.900]   Well, you get to those higher rates,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.960]   as you know, twice as fast,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.440]   and so you can very quickly increase the tax rate
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.720]   on some of those RMDs, and now, of course, your kids.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.880]   If you don't have more than one or two children
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.360]   or one or two recipients,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.480]   there could be a lot of money
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.320]   that they have to take out over 10 years
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.640]   and at a time where they already
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.400]   have a fair amount of taxable income,
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   so that's one big aspect of the where do you take it from.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.560]   You know, the other aspect of it
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.840]   is that if you think about a portfolio
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.120]   that has diversification in it, you know,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.580]   I don't care whether it's 50, 60, 70,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.440]   maybe as high as 80% equities,
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.000]   you've probably got an overall yield
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.440]   from interest and dividends that's about 1 1/2%,
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.220]   maybe as high as two if interest rates go higher
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.280]   and just depending on that allocation
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.920]   and how much is in bonds.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.520]   That goes a long way toward funding
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.160]   what you wanna take out every year.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.040]   You know, it could be a third to 40%,
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.640]   maybe even a little more than that,
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.600]   so then it's just a matter of, you know,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.440]   if you're doing your rebalancing
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.080]   and equity markets are down, you know,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.840]   your fixed income's gonna be overweighted
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.060]   and that's what you're going to take the money from.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.140]   It's a big change in retirement
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.700]   when you think about the role of bonds.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.000]   It is not, the most important thing bonds do
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.460]   is not provide income.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.020]   They provide an asset class
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.240]   that if you make the right choices
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.000]   that doesn't go down at a time
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.720]   when everything else is down and you need money
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.280]   and so it's setting yourself up to always have money
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.000]   that you can take, that you need
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.100]   and you just don't put yourself in a position
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.000]   where you have to sell low.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.680]   - So following up on that,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.760]   2022 was a year where bonds didn't deliver
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.400]   that ballast effect for equities.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.680]   They both went down for the same reason,
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.940]   both stocks and bonds.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.340]   So do you think it makes sense to hold some cash reserves
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.740]   on an ongoing basis for that rare 2022 type year
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.160]   where both asset classes struggle?
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.200]   - Yeah, it sure makes a lot more sense in hindsight
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.020]   and, you know, and, you know,
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.100]   applaud it's to Christine for going out there
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.740]   before, you know, 2022 out there and saying,
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.220]   well, I think there are good reasons
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.860]   to have a portion of your fixed income in cash
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.500]   because the reason is you want some money
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.060]   that you know isn't going to go down.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:10.060]   And so, you know, the thing and kind of related to this,
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.780]   and I think this might be a later question,
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.020]   I'm gonna jump to the kind of the total bond approach
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.500]   because, you know, when you think about fixed income,
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.160]   you've got higher quality, lower quality,
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.820]   shorter term, longer term, and it doesn't, you know,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.540]   we all know that in different environments,
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.500]   those if you style boxes, if you will,
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.320]   a fixed income are going to perform differently.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.780]   People were surprised by 2022.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.400]   There was nothing surprising about 2022.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.380]   Bonds behaved exactly the way
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.660]   they should have given the conditions.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.560]   It's just that people put themselves in a position
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.400]   where they got, they forgot.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.200]   They forgot that longer term bonds go down more
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.820]   when entrance rates rise
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.260]   and they didn't have money in places
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:04.180]   where they weren't exposed to that kind of risk.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.500]   And so, if you have all of your fixed income
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.100]   in the same ETF or the same bond,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.820]   there's no way to sell the short term bonds
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.580]   that you wanna access without also selling
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.720]   the longer term ones that you don't.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.140]   And a recession's the same way.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.380]   The lower quality bonds are gonna suffer.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.380]   The higher quality bonds are gonna do just fine.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.340]   So, if you break those up and always have an aspect,
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.180]   whether it's cash, whether it's some T-bills,
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.220]   whether it's a very short term ETF,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:41.020]   that you know that when you get conditions like 2022,
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.420]   they're gonna hold their value
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.180]   or they're only gonna go down two or 3%
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.300]   when the bond market was down 13.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.540]   - So, I know we have a lot
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.900]   of sort of three fund portfolio enthusiasts in the room.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.900]   It sounds like in my accumulation phase,
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.740]   I'm probably fine with that three fund portfolio,
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.180]   but then when retirement hits,
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.900]   I want a little more nuance in my bond portfolio
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.980]   to be able to maybe say,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.900]   I just wanna pull from my short term bonds in 2022.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.060]   - Well, anything you have in your portfolio
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.840]   should be there for a good reason.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.460]   And it should be a reason of something you wanna achieve
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.520]   or to be useful when there's a circumstance
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   you wanna avoid.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.660]   And if you think of a scenario
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.100]   where what you've got is gonna put you in a position,
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.420]   and the same with a total market index fund
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.700]   for equities also,
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.900]   where you're forced to sell some of everything,
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.660]   including stuff you really don't want to,
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.100]   that's a pretty good sign
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.040]   that maybe you wanna break things up just a little bit
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.260]   because it can help you avoid a problem you'd rather avoid.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.840]   - How about inflation protection?
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.660]   How do you think about adding inflation protection
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.260]   to your client portfolios?
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.620]   And is that something that people need
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.060]   in the accumulation years,
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.340]   or is it mainly when you're in decumulation
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.540]   where you need to be most on guard with that?
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.120]   Can you talk about that?
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.540]   - Well, a great way is, first of all,
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.060]   keep your expenses down.
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:14.060]   Vanguard did a study where they surveyed financial advisors
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.340]   and they wanted to know how many people had portfolios
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.540]   where the internal expenses were less than 20 basis points.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.820]   And I think the answer was 2%.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.140]   So we were happy to be in the minority
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.860]   with the way we do things, and that helps a lot.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.860]   And the stuff that has worked over time continues to work,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.580]   even with 2022.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.660]   If you go back over the last three years and five years,
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.260]   you'll find that equities outperformed commodities.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.180]   And so having a little bit more in equities
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:49.180]   just gives you over time a higher real return.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.620]   And so, and you don't have to get fancy with it.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.300]   It's the difference between 50 and 60% equities,
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.820]   or, and I just wanna say a little more about this
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.020]   because we think about,
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.140]   when we start to talk about that allocation,
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.140]   we're obviously talking about risk and volatility.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.800]   And along the way, we think about these terms vertically.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.360]   How high is the market?
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.140]   How low will it go?
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.700]   Where is the bottom?
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.060]   All of those are vertical terms, and that's important.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.480]   However, when you're retired, your risk becomes horizontal,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.840]   not vertical, not only vertical.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.620]   And by that, I mean,
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.140]   if you get a set of bad economic conditions,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.020]   market conditions, et cetera,
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.380]   and you need to be taking money out,
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.820]   you need to have enough unaffected money
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.380]   that you can draw on without changing your lifestyle,
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.100]   'cause that's the sign of a plan that failed.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.420]   For long enough, now that's a horizontal term,
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.260]   for a long enough period of time
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.180]   that the stuff that's down has a chance to recover.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.020]   And so then you find yourself looking at how,
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.220]   you know, peak to trough to back up to a point
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.380]   where you wouldn't mind selling your equities again.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.380]   How long a period of time do you want to be able
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.980]   to draw from without being put in a position
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.940]   of selling something before it's recovered enough?
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.140]   And whatever that length of time is for you,
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.180]   five years, eight years,
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.860]   depending on how you look at history,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.780]   that's very, very helpful in deciding
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.100]   how much you should have in fixed income.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.480]   But don't be fooled.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.020]   If you say eight years and you're trying out 4%,
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.980]   you don't need 32% in bonds,
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.540]   because each year, the bonds that you have
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.780]   are gonna throw off interest,
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.300]   and the stocks are still gonna throw off dividends,
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.240]   and so maybe your portfolio yield is one.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.580]   So that means you only need the other three for eight years.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.980]   And so that 32 is now 24.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.280]   This is simple math,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.520]   but it really, really can help you make informed decisions,
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.500]   and that makes a huge difference
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.580]   in rate of return over time.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.740]   - I have a small bore question about income distributions,
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.480]   which of course are higher today because yields are higher.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.540]   Do you just plow those
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.180]   into your retired client's spending accounts,
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.580]   or do they get reinvested?
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.380]   And how do you decide,
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.340]   and do market conditions factor
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.420]   into the decisions that you might make there?
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.300]   - So you're talking about
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.340]   interest and dividend distributions?
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.080]   - Yeah, any organically generated income distributions
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.500]   coming out of holdings.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.580]   - Well, when people are taking money out,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.940]   most of the time,
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.340]   and for those of you in the room that are retired,
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.320]   I mean, there's different ways
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.780]   that you can take money quarterly,
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.900]   you could take it in chunks,
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.940]   but a lot of people like a paycheck,
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.380]   and social security comes in monthly,
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.060]   and they like some level
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.620]   of regular portfolio distribution regularly,
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.220]   so the portfolio's gotta generate money
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.940]   every month anyway,
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.740]   and so when you get those monthly interest distributions
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.420]   on the fixed income,
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.060]   or you get the quarterly equity dividends,
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.700]   we do those in cash,
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.500]   not any capital gain distributions,
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.220]   'cause we want those to get reinvested,
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.780]   and then we'll sell what's needed along the way,
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.100]   kind of as a rebalancing,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.660]   it's a great way to rebalance.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.060]   - Okay, so I know that we have been
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.620]   putting note cards on the tables,
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.820]   and we will be collecting questions,
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.860]   so if you have questions
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.460]   that you would like John to tackle,
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.260]   people will be coming around to pick them up.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.500]   John, I had a question for you,
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.020]   I surveyed some advisor friends not so long ago
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.700]   about the toughest sell with their clients,
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.900]   whether it was getting them out of cash and into bonds,
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.540]   or whether it was keeping the faith with international,
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.620]   and the response from my advisor friends
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.740]   was increasingly keeping the faith with international
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.540]   is the tough conversation that they're having.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.700]   Can you talk about that,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.580]   and how you allocate your clients' portfolios,
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.740]   U.S. versus non-U.S.,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   and whether you do think that non-U.S. stocks
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.220]   represent potentially a better value today
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.580]   than the U.S. market?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.340]   - Well, of course they represent a better value,
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.180]   but that doesn't mean
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.860]   they're gonna get higher returns, right?
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.140]   I mean, people who have bought that argument
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.620]   have been waiting for 10 years,
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.100]   and this year may turn out to be a year
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.300]   where, at least this most recent quarter,
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.580]   I don't argue with people about it.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.580]   I literally say, you know, over the next 10 years,
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.540]   I can't tell you, I can't give you a reasoned opinion,
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.580]   or a case that one's gonna do better than the other,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.540]   can't even tell you that having an international allocation
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.100]   is gonna make your portfolio less volatile.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.220]   I will tell you that if you index the world,
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:50.180]   you've got 36% or 38% in international equity,
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.380]   so anything less than that
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.540]   is an active allocation decision,
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.900]   and maybe you wanna do it for that reason.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.460]   We have some clients that is like, well, that's fine.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.860]   In 10 years, we'll find out who was right,
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.940]   but why don't we, you know, if international represents 32%,
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.980]   maybe you wanna cut that in half and do 16.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.820]   We've been pretty US-focused just in our model portfolios,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.020]   and the international range has ranged
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.860]   between typically 25 and 30%, but it's a tough call,
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.660]   and the valuation piece, you know,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.620]   a lot of people have been buying value stocks
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.100]   for a long time and waiting for it to pan out,
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.380]   and maybe in somebody else's lifetime, they will.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.860]   We just don't know.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:37.020]   - Does the non-US allocation change for your clients
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.740]   based on their life stage?
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.660]   Do younger clients get more fully globally diversified
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.540]   portfolios and then maybe you back off
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.820]   as someone approaches retirement?
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.460]   - Well, yes and no.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.260]   You know, the view that we take in is that, you know,
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.460]   you kinda have an ideal equity allocation
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.860]   based on whatever your view of the world is.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.860]   Maybe it's just the way the world indexes,
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.540]   and so if a client has, you know,
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.740]   they're young and they're gonna have
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.140]   100% of their money in equities,
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.500]   they're gonna get that split,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.420]   and if someone is retired and in terms of
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.540]   what their needs are and speaking with them,
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.860]   you know, they're only gonna have 40% in equities,
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.420]   they're gonna have that same ratio.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.740]   We look at that as this is our best advice,
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.820]   and so the age piece doesn't really have
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.100]   a large factor involved in that the way we look at it.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.780]   - Okay, there's been a lot of hubbub
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.780]   about these sort of custom baskets of individual stocks
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.820]   versus just holding, say, a total market index fund
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.340]   and the ideas that you can do active tax loss harvesting
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.140]   with the individual stocks.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.260]   Can you talk about that?
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.260]   There have been a lot of claims about the potential benefits
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.940]   that that sort of active tax loss selling could yield.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.660]   Can you talk about how you think about that?
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.860]   - Well, I wanna ask you all,
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.380]   how many of you think that John Bogle
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.460]   would be rolling over in his grave over that idea?
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.380]   The one thing that we do know is it adds cost
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.300]   or it adds a lot of time and complexity
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.840]   in terms of doing that.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.860]   You know, that's about as far away
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.980]   from a total market fund as you can get.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:21.060]   We try to do things with, you know, in any area of advice
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.660]   based on some level of evidence or research,
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.300]   and I keep getting taken back to the work in the '90s
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.900]   by Fama and French
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.180]   that looked at determinants of equity results
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.340]   and what the two key factors that they found,
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.020]   in terms of your return,
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.420]   the first factor was how much do you have in equities?
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.820]   The second factor was do you have large or small cap?
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.260]   And the third one is do you have value style
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.080]   or growth style?
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.500]   And they found those were the three significant things
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.020]   and they pretty well held up.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:55.020]   I mean, so if you go and look at the annual returns of,
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:00.860]   and I'll, you know, let's say you use VTV and VUG, okay?
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.780]   Now, VTG plus VUG equals, you know, VOO.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.960]   - So, growth index plus value index.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.820]   - Growth index plus value index.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.580]   And if you look at it year by year,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.420]   you find that there are huge differences.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.780]   It's most of the time,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.840]   there's over 1,000 basis points spread in that.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.760]   That makes sense to us,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.920]   that rather than holding the two together,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.980]   where you always have to buy one
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.980]   and the other at the same time in a total index,
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.080]   you're gonna choose how much goes on the value side
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.100]   and the growth side.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.260]   That opens up a lot of opportunities
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.740]   for tax loss harvesting when it comes in.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.820]   We've just not wanted to add the expense of doing it.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.420]   And so we haven't been fans of that.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.980]   But the other thing I'll just add is that,
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.020]   yes, there are oftentimes little bits of tax loss selling
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.320]   you can do every year,
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.620]   but generally you only get one really good shot
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.300]   every five to 10 years.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.940]   And it needs to be shares you bought pretty recently
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.580]   that even in 2022,
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.980]   you probably had positions
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.360]   that still had unrealized gains in them.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.060]   They just didn't have as much as they did a year before.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.060]   So have the kinds of things in your portfolio
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.420]   between value and growth, large and small, there's four.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.700]   I don't think you need much more than those four.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.080]   And now you can really accomplish the same thing
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.760]   without adding any expense.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.700]   - A broader question.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.000]   There has been so much great research
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   on behavioral effects of how our emotions
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.700]   prevail upon us as investors.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.280]   I'm wondering, in working with clients,
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.320]   do you feel like there are any behavioral effects
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.820]   that have been under-recognized
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.740]   that you see again and again with your clients,
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.980]   things that trip them up?
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:48.340]   - I think the reason why the work of Kahneman and Tversky
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.280]   in the behavioral finance world still resonates today
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.900]   is because they really put their finger on a lot of them.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.740]   Recency bias, overconfidence.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.080]   Sometimes, though, it's just not understanding
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.440]   the difference that it makes
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.500]   when you have a little different allocation
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.400]   or you have a little different sourcing
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.700]   of where you take money from
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.160]   in terms of the after-tax wealth that you have.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.040]   But I think we fully know the enemy,
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.020]   and the enemy is us when it comes to that.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.480]   And we see all the time, we all know people,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.440]   and we recognize those emotions in ourselves,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.840]   even if we have the self-discipline to go,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.380]   now that would be not good, I'm sure I'd regret it,
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.120]   even though I'm feeling it today.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:38.140]   - Going back to that whole permission to spend problem
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.520]   that people don't wanna give themselves permission
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.060]   to spend what they could spend,
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.080]   Mike Piper, who's here and part of our Bogleheads community
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.260]   wrote a great book called More Than Enough
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.160]   that talked about lifetime giving.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.720]   I'm wondering if you can talk about
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.220]   how you work with clients on that.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.120]   And Mike's point that stuck with me was just that
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.040]   those gifts earlier to your kids, family members,
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.200]   when they're in their 20s and 30s
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.860]   are so much more impactful
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.380]   than when you give them money after your death,
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.140]   when they're 55 or 60 or older.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.760]   Can you talk about that and how you kind of coax
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   your clients to get, if you coax your clients,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.400]   to get more comfortable with giving their loved ones money
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.960]   during their lifetimes?
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.160]   Yeah, I mean, when I was in my 20s getting ready,
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.920]   we were getting ready to buy our first house,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.360]   you know, we had the offer in on it
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.060]   and had an unfinished basement.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.960]   And my parents said, what would $10,000 make a difference?
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.700]   And boy, did it ever.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.500]   We could finish the basement and have another room for,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.180]   you know, stay in the house a little longer
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.660]   when family came along.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.560]   So you're exactly right about those impacts.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.540]   You know, it starts with understanding
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.780]   that you have the ability to part with that money.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.900]   'Cause you not only have to be willing
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.200]   to take money out for yourself,
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.780]   you have to be willing to take money out
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.460]   and, you know, give it to your kids.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.780]   So that notion of knowing that, you know,
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.780]   and I'm gonna go back to my example before,
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.420]   if we save $3 million and we know
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.480]   that we're gonna wait to claim social security,
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.220]   so that's gonna take a $200,000 extra chunk
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.240]   out of our portfolio while we're buying
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.500]   that bigger social security check.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.740]   And then we need a core portfolio, a million seven,
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.240]   and the rest is money that can be for other things.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.700]   It's like, well, you've got this million dollars.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.440]   And unless you're taking out, you know,
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.440]   probably about 5% of it every year, it's gonna grow.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.960]   We can do the math on that.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.000]   And so just helping people realize
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.300]   the wealth growth path that they're on,
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.040]   and it goes beyond kids.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.320]   It's, you know, are there charities, non-profits,
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.940]   you know, religious organizations,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.180]   educational organizations?
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:57.260]   You know, you can save so much money in taxes
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.460]   if you incorporate giving while living through QCDs.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.980]   For just, you know, just maybe a smallish portion
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.540]   of what the RMD amount is.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.140]   And realize that as those numbers get bigger
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.320]   and bigger over time that you have to take out,
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.280]   that that really sets up, you know,
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.140]   maybe when you're, you know, spending money
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.100]   on your bucket list and on your kids and stuff,
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.660]   that's fine, you know, when you're in your 70s.
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.180]   But there comes a point where it's like, you know,
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.780]   we don't know what to do with all this money
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.820]   that we have to take out,
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.540]   and it's pushing us into higher rates,
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.180]   especially if you've had a spouse pass away,
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.660]   and now they're filing as a single taxpayer
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.020]   and pushing up more quickly into those higher brackets.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.440]   You know, having people be intentional
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.160]   about the places and the things
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.280]   that they want their wealth to be able to accomplish,
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.520]   it not only makes the world a better place,
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.500]   it makes them happier, and quite frankly,
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.260]   it preserves more wealth for their families.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.060]   - So I think we're ready to take questions if there are any.
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.720]   And just one last question from me, John.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.100]   You have, we've talked about Jonathan Clements,
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.060]   who has been such a wonderful member
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.700]   of our Bogleheads community,
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.060]   and you've talked about his influence on your work,
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.180]   and maybe you can just share that with the group.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.660]   - Yeah, it was a cool story.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.900]   It was in 2004, and I had just published
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.060]   the first paper of mine that anybody had ever read.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:28.060]   And it was in an era where, if you remember Money Magazine,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.620]   and you know, who really got,
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.340]   nobody really paid attention at that point
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.180]   to financial research.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.380]   And it was really who had the biggest megaphone,
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.340]   as opposed, and there wasn't even a PhD
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.620]   in financial planning yet at that point.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.220]   And Jonathan was the first person to call me,
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.780]   and he said, you know, let's talk about this,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.380]   and it became a column there.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.380]   And as I look back at that time, in the 2000s,
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.540]   Jonathan was, in my opinion,
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:03.380]   was the first major consumer journalist
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.020]   to realize the value of the empirical side,
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.740]   of making good decisions about your money.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.860]   And you know, Jonathan's personality was one
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.680]   where he wanted to learn all the stuff, too.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.860]   He didn't want to just, you know,
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.580]   hear it from the person who had done it.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.300]   He wanted to understand it himself.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.980]   And so today, when you look at people
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.060]   who, whether they're quoting Wade Fowler,
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.340]   David Blanchard, or you know, whomever is in there,
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.140]   the first real, the first big-time name
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.860]   to ever see that we can help people
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.300]   by going to sources like that, in my opinion,
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.020]   was Jonathan Clements.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.140]   - Thank you, that's great.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.260]   Jim, I know we've gotten some questions.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.800]   If you could help us sift through them.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.020]   It looks like you've got quite a lot going on up there.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.120]   - Yeah, we sure do have a lot of questions.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.020]   We got a two-hour worth of questions here.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.860]   And we got eight minutes to do 'em.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.980]   So, it's gonna be rapid fire.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.820]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.580]   You're gonna get three or four of these, maybe.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.660]   And then you're gonna have to catch these guys
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.140]   in the hallway.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.260]   After this, we have a book signing out front, you know,
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.820]   which is the very social hour.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.540]   You can go around and talk to people.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.820]   And then afterward, we have, of course,
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.180]   our evening social, our opening social is this evening.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.760]   So, if your question doesn't get answered,
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.180]   which it probably won't be, keep that in mind.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.660]   This conference is not over.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.540]   We're not going anywhere.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.680]   You'll be able to ask your questions afterward.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.740]   All right, let's do the first one.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.500]   When you withdraw dynamically,
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.940]   when in the year do you withdraw?
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.560]   And is it once a year or more frequently?
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.460]   - The research always assumes you take it out
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.860]   probably January 1st.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.640]   In reality, monthly or quarterly or whatever works for you.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.020]   - Okay.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.820]   How do you determine the starting withdrawal rate
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.580]   when using the guardrail strategy?
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.720]   - How much gross do we need to take out this year
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.460]   divided by whatever amount is in that core portfolio?
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.720]   So, if you take Morningstar's most recent research
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.300]   and you say, okay, 5.3%.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.460]   We're gonna use that approach
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.620]   and that's gonna be the number.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.620]   And if I need $53,000 given all the other sources I have,
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:07.060]   then my core portfolio has gotta start at a million.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.020]   And that's 5.3 and then we go from there.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.460]   - All right, a little controversy with this one.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.220]   Earlier this year, Michael Kitsies published an article
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.820]   in which the authors argued
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.300]   the Guyton-Clinger guardrails are too risky
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.920]   for most retirees.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.360]   In short, how would you respond to that argument?
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.620]   - I would need to be reminded about what the risk was.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.660]   - I don't have any more than what was on the question.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.060]   I'm not sure I read the article.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.100]   - I think it was Derek Tharp maybe saying
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.380]   that you should refer to that probability
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.540]   should be the guiding light
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.540]   for determining how much you take out.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.460]   - Yeah.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:53.460]   You can take any withdrawal rate you want
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:58.580]   and you're either gonna make it lower
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.300]   because you want a higher certainty.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.300]   You're going to, or if you don't want the risk
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.300]   of not being able to keep up with inflation,
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.260]   you have to start lower.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.100]   There's no free lunch.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.200]   It's just a matter of the preferences that you place.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.960]   And quite frankly, if you saved enough money,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.880]   you probably don't need to be worried
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.260]   about whether you're taking out four or 5%
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.640]   because what you need isn't that amount.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   So yeah, the one thing about some of the software-based
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:34.580]   running and you rerun it and you look at the probability
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.580]   is that when the software has some type of decision rule
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.520]   or guardrails built into it,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.660]   the software knows in the middle of the scenario
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.120]   to make the adjustment.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.100]   It just does it.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.520]   And at the end of your thousand scenarios,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.380]   it comes back and it says, okay, we had 10% of them failed.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.900]   We tried, we applied the rules.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.820]   We saved some of them, 10% failed.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.460]   And if you do a scenario or you're using an engine
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.520]   that doesn't have those built in and you say,
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.280]   you can only have 10% that fail.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.480]   So the 10% that fail are the 10% that include
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.420]   the ones that were gonna fail anyway
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.340]   and the ones that you could have saved but didn't
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.820]   because your software didn't know to make an adjustment.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.420]   If you only get 10% failures
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.700]   and now you've got two categories as opposed to one,
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.340]   you've gotta start with a lower withdrawal percentage.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:30.080]   So the great thing is I think we're really talking
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.880]   about very small differences.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.580]   And I just wanna, here we are on the 30th anniversary
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.020]   of Bill's work and it's like, we have come so far
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.700]   and people have so much more confidence
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.340]   in whatever withdrawal method they're using.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:50.240]   Before Bill, you had people like Peter Lynch at Fidelity
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.180]   saying, well, 10% of your auto work.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.380]   And because it was Peter Lynch,
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.380]   people thought it must be right
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.380]   because he ran Fidelity Magellan.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:03.180]   And so it's really a much better time to be looking at this
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.020]   from a retiree standpoint.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:05.860]   - Isn't that the truth?
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.860]   Now we're arguing about 0.03 differences
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.780]   whereas people were taking out 8% and 10%.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.260]   Your portfolio average is 8% and you can take out 8%.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.740]   All right, here's one not so related I think to guidelines,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.740]   but when does diversification become simply dilution?
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:29.100]   - Well, as I said earlier, you always,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.900]   anything in your portfolio that gives you diversification
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.680]   needs to be there for a reason.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.420]   And it's probably because something,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.040]   you want some less correlation going on
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.460]   or at least you want certain things that are separate
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.900]   so you can choose to take money out of here and not there.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.180]   And so, as long as it's helping you accomplish
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:51.820]   one of those things, it's probably not delusion,
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.060]   but there's a heck of a lot of stuff out there
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.700]   where you look at the diversifier that's being talked about
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.940]   and it's just somebody has something to sell.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.400]   And they haven't stood the test of time.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.260]   - Speaking of things to sell, somebody wants us to do a poll
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.220]   so we're gonna do a quick poll.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.260]   Can you poll the audience?
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.740]   How many have more than 20% international
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.560]   in their portfolio?
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.140]   I'm assuming 20% stock total portfolio,
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.900]   more than 20%, raise your hand.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.220]   All right, there you go, there's your poll.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.080]   That one's easy.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.060]   Now we're gonna talk about private equity.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.460]   The private wealth, private equity investment
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.360]   advising industry has grown enormously in recent years.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.260]   What's your opinion of its place in a retiree's portfolio?
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.180]   - Well, you know, it's different if it's liquid
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.320]   and where the costs are.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.500]   You know, it's an active managed choice.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.900]   And so you would wanna look at it the same way
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.780]   you evaluate any kind of an active manager
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.540]   that you would put into your portfolio.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.440]   You know, it's small cap before it becomes small cap,
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.420]   if you will.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.740]   And so it ought to work and in some places it does.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.360]   So, you know, if you can find a way to do it
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.160]   in the products, you know, there's an old saying
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.000]   that the most expensive wrapping paper in the world
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.740]   comes for financial products.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.160]   As soon as you wrap a layer around something,
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.180]   you know, you're adding things
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.680]   that take away from the results.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.160]   So, you know, it's the same,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.400]   it's just ask the same questions you would ask
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.740]   as an intelligent investor.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.520]   There's Benjamin Graham for you all the way around.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.360]   - Yeah, okay, last one here.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.800]   With the guardrail strategy, what is the maximum cut
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.560]   that you would have had to take historically
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.780]   in '29 or '73 or 2000?
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:42.840]   - A lot of it, once you have to take the first cut,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.280]   it becomes a lot more likely
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.720]   that you'll need to do another one
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.280]   because you need things to get better
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.900]   before you kind of get out of the woods
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.240]   because you're still taking money out.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   So in what you, so, but even when you go back
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   to the Great Recession, we saw that in '08,
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.560]   you know, at the end of '08,
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.560]   there was a big enough down draw in the market
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.400]   at that point that you needed to take a cut
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.280]   and '09 didn't start out well.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.360]   The actual market low was in March of the Great Recession.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.760]   But then it got better, it got better fast.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.440]   And you had double digit,
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.600]   I think the market was still up 30% for the year
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.960]   even after being down 20%, you know, for the first quarter.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.720]   So there didn't turn out to be another cut.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.080]   But it could happen.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   And, you know, if you think about 5.3 and cut 10%,
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:43.320]   that's 4.8, cut another 10%, that's, you know,
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.020]   call that 4.3, you gotta have a number of cuts
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.780]   before you get back down to what would have been safe
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.960]   and sustainable where you would never have that.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.480]   But yeah, you gotta be prepared to take your medicine
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.820]   and sometimes you have to have another round.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.840]   - Yeah.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.520]   Let's give a round of applause to Christine and Jonathan.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.740]   you
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.800]   you
