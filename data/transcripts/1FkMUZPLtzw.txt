[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   We're here to help you get started.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760]   It's expected that the Fed will raise rates throughout 2022 and maybe 2023, and then cut
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.160]   them again in the near future, possibly before the elections.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   Isn't the following strategy an easy win?
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.240]   Buy when rates get high, and sell when back to zero.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.320]   I know these cycles aren't supposed to be as short as they are now, but I don't see
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.960]   much attention on this strategy and segment.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.800]   The bond market is certainly governed more by math than the stock market is.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.080]   The bond market is easier in terms of expected returns.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.160]   When it comes to the stock market, you could nail the forecast on dividends or earnings
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.840]   or sales or whatever other fundamental you want to pick, but it's impossible to predict
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.600]   investor emotions, and investor emotions are what help with determining valuations.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.440]   So in the 1970s, earnings grew 10% per year.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.960]   It was a terrible market for the stock market.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.700]   In the 1980s, earnings grew like 5% a year, less than 5%, and the stock market did wonderfully.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.440]   So you could predict these things and not know what people are willing to pay for them
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.840]   because of a bunch of other factors.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.400]   But long-term returns for bonds are fairly easy to predict.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.900]   So John, let's do a chart on.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.640]   This is starting 10-year yields for the 10-year Treasury and subsequent 10-year returns.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.040]   So you can see these two lines.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.580]   They're pretty darn close, right?
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.200]   So the correlation between them is like 0.95, between starting yield and future 10-year
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   returns.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.560]   Now, this might seem blatantly obvious to certain people, but to other people, it's
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   not because, well, what about inflation and interest rates moving and all these things?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.000]   And the best determiner for long-term bond returns over 5, 7, 10, 12 years is just your
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.280]   starting yield.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.920]   It's pretty easy to predict.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.520]   So I like the idea here by this person, trying to think of bonds as maybe easier than timing
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   the stocks.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.840]   But if you're going to do it, you probably have to have some rules, and this person has
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   some rules.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.760]   So they say when they get high, and I'm assuming, let's call high 4% or 5%, and they say back
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   down to zero.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.920]   That range sounds pretty good right now.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.320]   The problem is, what if your rules are entirely off?
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.080]   I looked at the distribution of 10-year yields going back to 1945.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.520]   John, let's see it.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.960]   This just shows the distribution of yields.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.560]   So yields have only been 2% or lower 7% of the time.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.000]   They've been lower than 4% roughly 1/3 of the time.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.200]   So the range that we're in right now for yields is kind of unprecedented in the last, I don't
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.840]   know, 80 years or so.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.400]   Now, it could be, but what if the ceiling is much higher than we think right now?
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   What if you say my ceiling is 4.5% and I'm going to buy every time it gets there, and
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   I go to 7?
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.920]   Or what if you say my floor is zero, but the floor, for a while at least, is two instead
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   of zero?
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.040]   What if the Fed doesn't go quite as low as they've been?
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.000]   So I think that's the problem.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.720]   And also, while the long-term is relatively easy to predict in bonds, John, show the one-year
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   chart here.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   Chart on for the one-year.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.040]   This just shows the starting yield with one-year return.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   You can see this is all over the map.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.600]   The yield on Treasuries over any one-year period doesn't really tell you anything, because
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.520]   interest rates move and inflation and investor preferences and all these things.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   So it's tough.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.400]   I mean, the good news is, bond returns typically aren't as volatile as the stock market.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.840]   So a big misstep probably isn't going to cost you as much.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.040]   But do you really want to add another element of potential volatility to your portfolio?
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.520]   To the part of your portfolio that's supposed to be more stable and less volatile?
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.040]   I do think investors are probably going to have to be a little more thoughtful about
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.960]   fixed income exposure going forward.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.000]   And you could say, right now, the way the yield curve is positioned, I want to be in
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.640]   short-term bonds, because they're giving higher yields than long-term bonds.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.200]   Or I want to take a little more duration, because I think there's going to be a recession,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.120]   and yields are going to fall, and I'm going to get some -- so a lot of it depends on what
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   you want to get.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.280]   Do you want stability and safety in your portfolio?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   So maybe on the short end of the bond?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.400]   Or are you looking for a total return and getting some price action where you want to
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.960]   make some moves, where you want to use macro variables?
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.400]   I just think if you want to be more tactical in bonds, it seems easier, but it's easier
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.280]   to be tactical long-term in bonds than it is short-term.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.640]   And so timing the bond market is probably easier than timing the stock market, but that
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.840]   doesn't necessarily mean it's a slam dunk, because there's so many other variables involved.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.280]   Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.320]   I mean, with bonds, too, it seems like so many people roll into them big-time when,
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.800]   you know, it's the bottom or near the bottom, right?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.120]   Historically, it seems like that's what often happens.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.040]   People look to hedge when it's kind of, I guess, too late.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.600]   I think Josh was recently talking about this.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.080]   Well, a lot of it is, yeah, the asset allocation changes.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.640]   Just changing asset allocation a ton of times, just -- it opens up the potential for an unnecessary
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.980]   or avoidable mistake.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.920]   And for a lot of people, I think it's probably easier, like you said, Duncan, just setting
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.520]   it and forgetting it and not trying to be too cute with this stuff, because how much
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.240]   are you really going to add to your returns if you're constantly jumping in and out of
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.600]   the bond market and going back to cash?
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.680]   One wrong move could effectively take out any right moves you make, too.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.120]   So all right, let's do another one.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   Next question.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   Okay.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   And that question was from Georgie.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.120]   So up next, we have the following.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.800]   My name is Max, and I'm a new financial advisor.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.320]   My dad decided to throw me a bone to help me get started by entrusting me with around
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.200]   $400,000 of equities and cash to manage.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.300]   My dad is 76 and has been retired for over two decades, not to brag.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.960]   He as well often doesn't look at these investment accounts all that often.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.240]   His money is primarily in mutual funds, ETFs, and cash.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.040]   Being new to the business, I'm struggling to understand what to do with the money he
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.480]   wishes to transfer over to me.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.520]   What is your advice for how to manage a large sum of money when you're first starting out
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   in the industry?
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520]   All right.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   So if Max wants to be the next Bernie Madoff, he can start siphoning this money from his
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.400]   dad because the dad's not paying attention.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.560]   No, I mean, this seems like the perfect scenario to get some practice as a newbill financial
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.600]   advisor that wants to gain some experience.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.480]   So it sounds like the father is in a good financial position, so he probably can't screw
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   things up too badly.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.240]   I'm sure that's why he's giving you this.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.520]   But my whole line of thinking is you can't possibly hope to invest money on someone else's
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.880]   behalf without understanding what their goals are and what they want to do with the money.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.640]   So this is the perfect time to get some reps in as a young financial advisor and have a
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.800]   conversation with your father.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.920]   So what do you plan to do with this money in the future?
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   What's your time horizon?
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   What's your risk profile?
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.400]   What are your return expectations?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.200]   How much are you willing to lose to get those return expectations?
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.560]   How do you invest the rest of your money?
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.980]   Is this bucket going to be a complement to the rest of your money?
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.360]   Is it going to be invested a similar way?
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.400]   What are the tax issues, potentially, if this is taxable money?
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.480]   When do you plan on spending this money?
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   Is this for us?
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   Is this for the next generation?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.840]   Is this free to spend soon?
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.360]   So I think if you're a young person, you definitely need some reps, and this is the perfect time
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   to do it.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   Sit down and have a conversation.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.880]   It's not always easy to mix financial advice with family, unfortunately, but it sounds
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.000]   like this is a pretty good chance to get your feet wet, and then really sit down and have
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.840]   a conversation with your father about, well, what are you doing this for?
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   What's the point of it?
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   And if he has an investment plan elsewhere, maybe you can incorporate it into that.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.080]   But that's what you need to do, is have a question.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.780]   It's not like, well, I think you should invest in municipal bonds, I think you should invest
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.740]   in growth stocks, I think you should put your money in small cap value.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740]   That's not the idea here.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.240]   The idea is, what are your goals, what's your risk profile, what's your time horizon, and
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.580]   then we can build a plan for you.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.640]   And that's the conversation you need to have with your father, just like you're going to
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.960]   have with clients in the future.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.000]   Yeah, and I like that he's asking us though, right?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.120]   He's asking you for your advice, rather than being like a know-it-all, and thinking that
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.080]   as a noob financial advisor, he knows everything.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.920]   So that's good that he's surveying.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.920]   Yeah, it's okay to say, I don't know everything, but you do have to know what the client is.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.760]   I think the important thing here is that the client's circumstances and your father's circumstances
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.600]   are more important than what's going on in the market, probably.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.820]   That's the starting point.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.640]   Would you want to manage $400,000 for your family members?
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.680]   That doesn't sound fun to me.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.200]   Mixing financial advice and family is difficult, because if things go well, you're probably
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   not going to get much credit.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.020]   If things go poorly, you're going to get the blame.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.200]   So it's a good time to have a conversation about it, but just setting expectations is
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.800]   probably not a bad thing either.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   Right, yeah.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.560]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.400]   Okay, up next we have a question from Kim.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.980]   I'm sure many of your listeners' ears perked up when Michael said he was no longer keeping
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.860]   cash at Marcus, but instead had moved to New York State Munis.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.300]   Can you expand on this as a choice in the current environment?
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.060]   I've looked at Muni funds, state-specific funds, and state-specific ETFs that use leverage.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.980]   Any thoughts on the differing formats?
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.860]   Duncan, last week I think you said we're getting more bond questions, and it is true.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.020]   We're getting so many questions about bonds these days.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.340]   I think it's just because everything's a little more interesting there and yields are finally
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.340]   higher.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.700]   So I'm not going to answer on his behalf.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.580]   Let's bring him in and ask him himself.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.580]   Michael Batnick.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.580]   Here I am.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   He's here with us today.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.580]   The Batman.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.540]   I felt like Eric Andre in the "Let Me In" meme, or gif, you know?
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.540]   I know.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.380]   Let's get on the action.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.180]   The people want to know, why did you change from Marcus to Muni funds?
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.260]   What are you going for here?
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.500]   Before we get to that, I just have to compliment Duncan's hat.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.460]   Show me the quack on that Daffy thing.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.060]   Well, there's no like audible quack, but you know, it has the bill.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.220]   It should make a sound when you open that thing up.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220]   That is pretty fabulous.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.220]   They used to.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.220]   That's the quacker.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.220]   Did you see any fans in Disney?
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.220]   Anybody stop you with that shirt on?
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.220]   No one has.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.220]   No one stopped me.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.220]   I mean, you're pretty recognizable.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.740]   I mean, there's dozens of people who know me.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.140]   All right.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.500]   So what's the question?
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.480]   Why did I, why am I investing in municipal bonds?
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.140]   So you went, it sounds like you went from, I think you mentioned Sentinel Spirits.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.460]   You took your money out of an online savings account and moved into Muni's.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.580]   What was the reasoning there?
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.300]   So before I answer that, and I'm not just filibustering, you said we're getting a lot
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.540]   of questions about bonds these days.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.420]   You know, questions we're not getting about the triple Q's until yesterday.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.940]   Did you see that email coming in Ben yesterday?
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.940]   I didn't see it.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.940]   No.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.900]   2021 was all about the TQs and somebody emailed us yesterday.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.340]   I know you guys haven't spoken about it lately.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.660]   We'll get to that on Animal Spirits.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.660]   All right.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.940]   So here's the deal.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:03.860]   Marcus is now offering 2.15% on cash, which is not bad.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.220]   It's a hell of a lot better than zero or 25 basis points or whatever it was.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:15.740]   So this cash that I have allocated to New York State Muni bonds is not cash that I have
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.180]   earmarked for any particular purchase.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.300]   If it was, I would not be holding municipal bonds because guess what?
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   They're not risk-free.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   Matter of fact.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.620]   So this is more of like an intermediate term than a short term, I guess.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.620]   I have no.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.820]   I mean, I have no stated use for the cash, not to brag.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.740]   It's just sort of sitting there for a rainy day.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.660]   So this particular fund is 11% off its highs.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.300]   I bought the dip, so I'm only down 1%, but whatever.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   That's not the point.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.500]   The point is that this is now the stated yield on the thing is over 3%.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.300]   I'm in New York, high-tax state.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.020]   And what do you pay, 80% taxes there?
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   Taxes.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:01.020]   It's worth it because I get to buy $15 burritables from Chipotle.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:08.180]   So on a tax equivalent basis, I'm getting over 5%, which feels pretty okay.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.180]   Pretty compelling.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.180]   That is pretty good.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.860]   I looked at the average yield for a handful of short-term Muni bond funds.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.180]   You can look at them anywhere, Vanguard or iShares or Schwab or wherever.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.980]   In the range for yield to maturity, the average yield to maturity is like 3% to 3.5%.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.180]   So to your point, we're talking at least a 4% to 5%, maybe 6% tax equivalent yield if
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.100]   you're not paying federal and state taxes on there, if you do the state-specific fund.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   So that's not bad.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.020]   Let me say one more thing.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.700]   Somebody asked about losing leverage.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:39.260]   If you are confident in your assertion that you think interest rates are topping and you
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.940]   want to make a tactical call on interest rates, which is what I'm doing with this particular
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.260]   slug of money, then sure, why not use leverage?
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.400]   However, I'm not looking to make a bond trade here, right?
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:57.060]   So I'm not looking to have like a 24% drawdown in Munis, which has it ever happened?
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.420]   Maybe it has.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.100]   But either way, if it does happen, no, the deepest drawdown that I'm looking at was 2020,
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.100]   which was-
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.620]   And I suppose the leverage would come with a closed-end Muni fund.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.500]   There's no leverage in any ETF probably.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.100]   You'd probably be investing in a closed-end fund that uses leverage and maybe is trading
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.100]   at a discount.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.100]   Yes.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.100]   And then you're trying to play the bond market.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.100]   I'm not looking to do that.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.260]   You could also do that if you really are like trying to make a bet on duration or interest
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.260]   rates, which I'm not doing.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.020]   You could do ZROZ, which is down a cool 50%.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.020]   Holy gazole.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.540]   So anyway, 5% plus tax equivalent.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.020]   Now you've got my attention.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.260]   Getting back to our stuff about timing the bond market from the first question, I think
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.940]   the last couple of years should show anyone that predicting interest rates is really tough
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.940]   to do.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.020]   The Fed can't do it.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.580]   I think anyone trying to say either rates are going to go to 7% from here or they're
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.820]   going to go back down to 2%, I mean, you could place a probability on that, but I wouldn't
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.420]   want to bet my emergency savings on that either way.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.980]   So I think, yeah, using leverage for emergency savings.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.820]   There's a big difference between cash and emergency savings.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.820]   This is cash.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.380]   It's not emergency savings.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.380]   Right.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.380]   Okay.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.380]   Do another one.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.780]   And when you're, just to clarify, when it's New York state for you as a New York resident,
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.260]   your tax advantage from a state and federal standpoint for munis?
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   Okay.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.260]   That's right.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.500]   I don't take tax advice from anyone wearing a daffy duck hat.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.500]   But...
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.500]   Well, I would never give it.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.620]   I would never give it.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.220]   Okay.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.300]   Up next, we have a question from Brennan.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.580]   I'm new to the market, so this is my first bear market experience.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.580]   This could be way off, but I have a theory.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.180]   It seems like the first half of the year sentiment was so pessimistic that it brought us to a
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.180]   low 4.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.980]   It was negative news after negative news, causing the market to say, okay, we get it.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.220]   Everything is red.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.780]   Now we see upticks from positive earnings and buy-in, only to be followed by more unforeseen
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.380]   negative catalysts the following week, dropping to lower lows, thus confirming our original
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.700]   negative sentiment bringing us further down.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.340]   I'm curious if there's any historical evidence that backs up this theory that uncertainty
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.060]   can bring us lower lows more quickly than actual negative news.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.060]   I mean...
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.060]   This is a good one.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   So...
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.060]   100%.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.700]   John, throw up our first chart here of the worst years in the stock market.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.260]   So this just shows the worst years ever for the U.S. stock market, going back to 1928.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.980]   And I put a reason next to every one of them.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.500]   You can see there was the Great Depression, Great Financial Crisis, '73, '74 bear market,
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.740]   dot-com crash, all these bad...
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.400]   World War II, all this stuff.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.860]   I think usually when you have a nasty, prolonged bear market, it's for a reason.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.620]   Obviously, uncertainty comes into play, but I think the only crash, maybe we didn't have
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.500]   a nasty economic crash, crisis attached to it, was 1987.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.220]   And that seemed to come back really quick.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.140]   Even then, the stock market was going bananas and rates were rising pretty quickly.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.100]   But I think the uncertainties you're dealing with are always, for every bear market, how
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.780]   much longer will this last?
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.400]   How long will it take to break even?
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.260]   How much worse will this get before it gets better?
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   Ben, can I nitpick?
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.260]   Can I nitpick?
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.380]   Can I get that chart back on, John, please?
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.380]   What?
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.060]   You can't give the reason for a bear market as bear market.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.060]   1974.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.060]   Okay.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.780]   There's no name for that one, though.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.100]   Yes, there is.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.100]   What's the name?
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.100]   The oil embargo, stagflation, inflation.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.700]   You can't say the reason why stocks had a bear market, it's because of the bear market.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.700]   Come on.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.540]   So, 2008 is the Great Financial Crisis, 2000 to 2002 is the dot-com bust.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.540]   What's '73, '74?
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.540]   There's no good name for it.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.540]   I just told you.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   What?
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540]   The oil embargo.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.540]   The inflation.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.540]   What's this one going to be called?
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   What do you mean?
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.540]   What do you mean?
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.540]   I'm throwing out for this one right now, it's the Great Inflation.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.540]   What do you think about that?
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.700]   2022, the Great Inflation.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.700]   The Great Inflation?
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.700]   Yeah, it's a good one.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.700]   Put great in front of it and people are going to remember that.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   Okay.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   So, here's the thing.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.700]   No one knows the answers to those questions.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.700]   Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.700]   I have another one.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700]   I have another one.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.700]   Inflategate?
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.420]   But, I mean, don't you think that, yes, uncertainty is part of it, but most of the time, especially
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.900]   this year, I think there's been a lot of bad news and the stock market has taken that
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.900]   into account.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.140]   So, it's not just the fact that things are uncertain and no one knows what's going to
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.140]   happen.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.140]   It's that there's bad news that's hitting the stock market.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.140]   So, okay.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.520]   So, to get back to this question, if there is any historical evidence that backs up the
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.780]   theory that uncertainty can bring us lower lows quicker than actual negative news, absolutely.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.740]   This is the opposite of sell the news, buy the rumor.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.740]   Buy the rumor, sell the news.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.860]   So, that would be sell the news type of thing or buy the news.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.340]   The market hates uncertainty.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:17.700]   So, once you get bad news, usually, or at least when the market is down so much, the
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.380]   market has anticipated that.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.540]   So, the market doesn't always bottom on bad news.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.420]   The market usually bottoms before it, in anticipation of.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.180]   I think you could say the uncertainty now is the biggest economic data point everyone's
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.100]   following is the inflation data, and it comes out once a month.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.380]   And so, in between those monthly inflation data points, there's a ton of uncertainty.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.180]   What is this Fed official going to say?
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.940]   Well, the other uncertainty is, to your point, what are the Fed officials going to say?
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.580]   Kashkari said today, "We are seeing almost no evidence that inflation has peaked."
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.580]   Really?
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.580]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.580]   Okay.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.820]   He also said, "I anticipate cracks in U.S. financial markets, but the bar for a change
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.700]   in Fed policy and response is very high."
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:00.060]   So, Kashkari is hell-bent on doing everything he can to signal that they're not pivoting.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.060]   They're deadly serious.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.480]   So, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of inflation and what the Fed's response to
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.980]   inflation will be.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.060]   Besides the perma bears, no one actually thinks that the bear market is going to last forever.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.700]   I think some people would find joy if it did.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.620]   The biggest uncertainty now is, okay, how long is this going to last and how much worse
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.620]   could it get?
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.620]   And that's the thing we don't know.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.220]   No one knows, is this thing going to get 10 times worse, are we going to go down 50%,
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.220]   or is this about the worst of it, and things are going to be choppy for a while, and then
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.380]   we're going to be fine, and all-time highs will be here again in no time?
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.660]   That's the thing that you can never predict in a bear market.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.740]   No one knows how long they're going to last.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   There?
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   That's right.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:42.860]   I feel like I don't hear enough Bad News Bears jokes in the market.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.500]   Have you heard many of those?
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.300]   It sounds like a layup.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.900]   Didn't that movie come from like 1980?
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.980]   I think it was in the early 2000s, right?
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.820]   That was the remake, Duncan.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   Oh, the remake.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.820]   Okay.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.820]   Yeah, I never saw the original.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.820]   Bad News Bears is like the '70s.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.820]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.820]   I didn't see that one.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.820]   I'm talking about the one with that guy.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.820]   I can't think of his name.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.820]   Billy Bob?
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.820]   Yeah, Billy Bob.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.500]   Is that a corduroy couch?
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.580]   It's actually not.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.100]   It looks like that on camera though.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.100]   All right.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   Another question.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.100]   Okay.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.420]   Up next, we have, "We're 38 years old, married with two kids.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.380]   Our total annual comp is about $200,000.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.820]   We have $125,000 in brokerage or savings and $500,000 in retirement."
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.820]   They didn't put not to brag, though.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   Pretty good.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.380]   "My employer recently announced a merger."
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.380]   New listener.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.100]   "My employer recently announced a merger with another peer where the other company will
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.340]   be the surviving entity.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.780]   As a result, I will be left with two options.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.300]   Option A, continue on with the new company.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:49.420]   Option B, take a payout of $500,000 and 18-month COBRA.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.460]   If we took option B, we'd likely move closer to family, but we'd be looking for new jobs.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:21:02.420]   My wife, who makes about $100,000 a year, could likely find something comparable anywhere
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.620]   we move, but my prospects of finding an equivalent are lower.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.780]   My gut says to take the payout and figure it out, but I'd love to hear your thoughts."
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.260]   This sounds to me like pretty decent options.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.980]   So if his wife makes $100,000, their total is $200,000, he's making $100,000.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.940]   The company's offering him five years' worth of a salary.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.700]   That sounds like a long time to be able to find a job, and you have 18 months of health
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.180]   insurance.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.300]   And if you actually like spending time with your family, moving closer to home seems to
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.700]   make sense.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.620]   This seems like a fairly easy one for me.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.340]   Obviously, the uncertainty of not knowing if you're going to find a job hurts, but don't
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.300]   you think it's now easier, depending on the industry or the job, to find a remote job
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.380]   these days instead of having to work somewhere and be at the place?
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.300]   I do, but given that he said, "My prospects of finding an equivalent are much lower,"
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.860]   I would say for what this person does, I'd take his word for it.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:59.300]   However, to your point and his point, he's got a five-year cushion, so surely it can't
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.300]   be that hard.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   Right.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.300]   Right?
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.740]   Even if it takes two years.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.620]   Unless they're saying that moving to family would be bad for them or something.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:16.460]   But I didn't get that from reading it, but it sounds like a positive.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.780]   Maybe you go to your current company and say, "All right, we're doing the merger.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.980]   I want you to double my salary to make it worthwhile for me to stay here."
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.260]   But the $500,000 to get out of there, I don't see how you could turn that down.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:32.740]   Plus, if you just put that $500,000 into levered municipal bond funds, boom, golden.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.740]   Now we're talking.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.740]   This is a pretty good life.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.760]   I think we've got one more life question here, and then we're out of here.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.220]   Just out of curiosity, why would a company offer that kind of payout?
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.220]   How is that financially?
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.540]   Because he's got real dirt on them.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.100]   He has pictures that they don't want him releasing.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.900]   If that's a severance package, it's a pretty good one.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.260]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.300]   Maybe he has some shares if it's a private company, or it could be that where he has
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.300]   some equity maybe.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   Okay.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.860]   It sounds like a pretty good deal.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.020]   Someone is saying you have to pay taxes on it, obviously.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.020]   That's true.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.740]   Also, you have to pay taxes on your income.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.260]   But I still think that's a pretty good margin of safety there, especially if it allows you
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.820]   to move closer to family and you have two kids.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.100]   That seems to make sense to me.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.100]   All right.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.100]   Let's do another one.
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.100]   Okay.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.580]   Up next, we have a question from Adam.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.100]   "My wife and I are leaning towards buying a home in the next few weeks.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.460]   I'm an idiot, right?
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.460]   Here's the deal.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:32.220]   We owe $100,000 on our $200,000 home right now at 3.75% 30-year rate.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:39.500]   We can put down 20% and get a fixed 10-year 5.5% arm after 10 years versus 7% 30-year
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.500]   fixed.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.420]   We want to buy our dream home in a school district we know we want to be in eventually.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.900]   Our son is three, so we have a little time.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.520]   I've been as financially prudent as one could be, and we've saved for this forever home
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.620]   for 10 years.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.380]   I'm planning to keep adequate savings available for the next few years of uncertainty and
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.860]   hope we can refinance in the next 10 years."
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.940]   Ben, do you mind if I go first so you don't take all the good talking points?
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.940]   Sure.
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.940]   Thank you.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.940]   Okay.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.940]   Here's the second part.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.940]   Oh, it's a two-parter.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.940]   It's a two-parter.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.820]   "How does one balance always making the right financial decision with living the life one
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.220]   desires?
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.700]   Mortgage rates are the highest they've been in 20 years.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.940]   Do I pass on the one-in-20-year home because it went on the market when the economic environment
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:19.940]   sucked?
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.220]   I'm leaning towards the YOLO approach, otherwise I fear I'll be 85 with a ton of retirement
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.420]   money but full of regret of a life lived as safely as possible."
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.500]   Michael, before you go and take the good points, I just want to do a pop culture reference,
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   then you can go.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   Okay?
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   John, throw up my ... This, to me, feels like Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   It's not your fault.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   It's not your fault.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   Do you know?
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   I know.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   It's not your fault.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500]   I know.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.500]   It's not your fault.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   What?
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   It's a coincidence that I fell asleep to this movie on Tuesday night.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.060]   The first, like, 30, 40 minutes are ... I mean, the whole movie's incredible, but the
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.540]   first 30 to 40, in particular, are really spectacular.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.340]   So that's ... this person ... you're going into a crappy house ...
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.340]   Time out.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.340]   Time out.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.340]   Go ahead.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.340]   Hold on.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.340]   It's my turn.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.340]   I'm the captain now.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.340]   Okay.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.340]   Go back to the first part of the question because I've ... now I'm thrown off because
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.500]   he, in the second part, he said ... he was talking about the one-in-20 home.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.340]   Duncan, or John, please throw up the first part of that question.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.580]   All right.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.580]   That might take him a second.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.580]   Okay.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.580]   A bit of quick housekeeping.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.260]   He's watching YouTube, he's watching ARM, is an adjustable rate mortgage, right?
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.260]   That's right.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.260]   Yes.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   Okay.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.260]   So here's the thing that threw me off.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.220]   He's talking about we want to buy our dream home in a school district we know we want
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.220]   to be in eventually.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.900]   So that told me that this home is not his forever home.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   But then he said it's a one-in-20.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.780]   So Ben, what do you make out of this?
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.780]   Because this matters.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.780]   I think this is ...
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.780]   Is this his forever home?
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.780]   It sounds like it is, but it isn't.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.780]   I'm not clear.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.860]   Well, he's saying that they want to live there for at least 20 years.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.580]   That sounds like a semi-forever home.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.740]   That's not what he said.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.820]   He called it a one-in-20 home.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.820]   I think he's saying it's like the rare home that actually fits all of their desires, right?
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820]   Fine.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   One-in-20.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820]   All right.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.820]   So here's why it matters.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.580]   If you're not going to be there for the duration, then the ARM absolutely makes sense, right?
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.740]   To save a point and a half, that's a significant savings.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.140]   The risk to that, and there are all sorts of different types of adjustable rate mortgages
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.260]   that have different bells and whistles.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:19.140]   The risk, of course, is that you end up getting very comfortable, and this does become a permanent
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:29.180]   home, and rates are higher in 10 years, which we were saying 10-year forecasts are silly
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.420]   on Animal Spirits this week because Druckenmiller was talking about where the Dow will be in
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   10 years.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   So I don't want to be a hypocrite here.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.580]   However, I will be a hypocrite, are 30-year mortgage rates going to be higher in 10 years
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.060]   than they are today?
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.060]   All right.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.460]   John, throw up my mortgage rate chart here.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460]   The last table.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.460]   Excuse me.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.460]   I asked a question.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.460]   I asked a simple question.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.460]   I'm going to hit you with data.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.700]   Look, so this is 30-year mortgage rates during every single recession since the 1970s.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:59.580]   The average decline is about 1.7% from the high during a recession to the low.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.060]   We're going to have a recession sometime in the next 10 years.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.500]   I think at that point, he's going to have the ability to refinance, correct?
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.860]   So I think the problem is I don't think you can feel like an idiot for being financially
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.260]   prudent, saving, and then finding your dream home.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260]   Guess what?
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.940]   The people who are in the best position to still buy right now, we've been talking about
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.460]   the housing market being kind of broken, the people who own a home and have some equity,
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.460]   it's going to be tough.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.180]   You're going to have to plug your nose and do it.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.660]   But if you find your dream home and you want to be in the school district, then I don't
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.100]   think you can feel bad at yourself for mistiming it.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.620]   If you can afford it, then you go ahead and do it, probably.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:40.580]   And if you can get the arm, yeah, I don't think you worry about the financial problems
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:46.140]   here and say, "Oh, I gave up this wonderful mortgage rate," and let that override all
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.140]   your decisions.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.940]   I think you just suck it up and you do it.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.940]   Agreed.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.220]   Didn't we talk about some places have portable mortgages?
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.780]   In Great Britain and Canada, I think.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.980]   But I say all else equal, the life decision should always trump the financial decision
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.180]   when it comes to this kind of stuff, right?
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.180]   1,000%.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.180]   It has to.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.180]   1,000%.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.180]   If it's going to make you happier.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   Switching it up.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.180]   I agree.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180]   Guess what?
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.140]   He said, "I fear I'll be 85 with a ton of retirement money but full of regret of a life
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.380]   lived as safely as possible."
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.420]   It sounds like they've already thought through all this too, right?
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.420]   They're saying it's a school district.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.060]   They want their kid to go to school in.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.740]   This sounds like a thoughtful person and it sounds like they're asking us to give them
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.500]   permission to do what they should do.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.180]   And Ben, do we give them permission?
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.180]   Yes.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.180]   Yes, we do.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   I'm giving them permission.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:37.700]   And if interest rates reset at 15%, don't come complaining to us, but yeah, go for the
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.700]   dream home.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.700]   Hey, this is fun.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.700]   You do this every Thursday?
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.700]   Can you believe it?
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.700]   Thanks for watching.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.700]   Live every Thursday?
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.700]   Just kidding.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.700]   I'm a fan.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.700]   You know I watch.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.700]   Yes.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.700]   Duncan, thank you for calling in from Disney.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.300]   I think, so Mike will be the next one to go to Disney in a few months, right?
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   February.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   I'm going in February.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.140]   I went earlier this year.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.100]   We're keeping the Disney economy humming.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.140]   We should do this as an economic indicator, just every quarter someone goes to Disney
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.140]   to report.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.140]   It really is.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.140]   All right.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.140]   So thanks to Duncan.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.220]   Did Duncan just put in a higher low on Disney?
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.900]   I think so.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.020]   Duncan, is that your hotel phone ringing?
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.020]   It's not actually.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.020]   What is that?
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.020]   All right.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   Maybe it is.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   I don't know.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.020]   Send us an email.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.980]   Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com and we'll see you next time.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.980]   Thanks Ben.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.980]   Thanks Duncan.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:26.980]   See you everyone.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.980]   Bye.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.980]   Bye.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:29.980]   Bye.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   Bye.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   Bye.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.980]   Bye.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.980]   Bye.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.980]   Bye.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.980]   Bye.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.040]   you
