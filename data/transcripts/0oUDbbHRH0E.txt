[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   I'm going to run through types of financial independence.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.080]   Traditional FIRE is have enough money to quit your job and never work again.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.560]   Lean FIRE, which would be the retiring early, but bringing your expenses way down.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.080]   Coast FIRE, it's saving up enough money so that you can stop contributing towards retirement.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.280]   Barista FIRE, which is you could choose to just have a side job that only covers the expenses.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.520]   And then the last one that I'll mention is...
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.960]   Most people, if they had the wherewithal to reach financial independence,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.200]   they are going to do fantastic things.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.640]   They're going to add value to the world.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.840]   They're going to do interesting and varied things.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.600]   What I actually would care about more than quitting my job is having the flexibility to work,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.800]   but also I would like to save up enough money so that I'm not beholden to a job,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.920]   but I don't want to sacrifice.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.000]   I want to be able to go on really nice vacations,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.360]   eat at whatever restaurants and spend money and live in a nice house.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.240]   Can you give a little more detail on that, how people are doing this?
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.960]   Yeah, I mean, I think...
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.920]   Brad, thanks for joining me.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.360]   Yeah, man, this should be fun.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.160]   I always love chatting with you, whether online or off.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.680]   So this should be a good time.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.280]   We did our first conversation.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.480]   Well, first one was many years ago on your podcast.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.760]   Yeah, you first joined me on April for what became episode two of All The Hacks.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.000]   And then we did it again for episode 100.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.680]   And we talked a little bit about FIRE at the beginning.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.680]   But I think both you and I have had an evolution of perspective on financial independence.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.920]   So much so that in researching this episode,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.360]   I found out that I didn't even know what "coast fire" was.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.400]   And it turns out that that's actually the thing I'm probably most in tuned with myself.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.480]   So lots of stuff to talk about when it comes to financial independence
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.400]   and how our perspectives have changed.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   Yeah, agreed.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.880]   Going way back to episode 71 on Choose FI.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.680]   So that was almost six years ago when we recorded this.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.920]   I think, yeah, unquestionably, both of our perspectives have changed significantly.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.080]   And I think, frankly, changed for the better in a lot of senses
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.720]   and changed for the healthier, certainly.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.880]   I think both of us probably veered a little bit too much towards the frugality
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.080]   and over-optimizing at the expense of maybe enjoyment of life sometimes.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.880]   And I think there's been an evolution, certainly for both of us, clearly.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.800]   But I think, frankly, in the greater financial independence world.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520]   And this is one of the very few things that I will
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.280]   pat ourselves on the back for at Choose FI is, I mean, we, for a very large degree,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.080]   and we have really been the center of the FI world for, I mean, the last handful of years.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.600]   And we have made this very strongly anti that, like the miserliness,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   the just, "Hey, let's race to some number at the expense of life."
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.040]   And I think we've tried really, really, really hard to make it about,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.880]   "Hey, what are you running towards, not what are you running away from?"
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200]   And I think just that little shift in orientation
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.920]   has made a big difference in a lot of people's lives.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.440]   Now, for anyone who didn't listen to the hundreds of episodes you've done,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.200]   the few we've done, hasn't ever introduced themselves to FIRE,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.720]   which will maybe only be a few people.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.400]   So briefly, briefly, since you're the pro, for anyone out there,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.560]   how would you just define financial independence
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160]   and the difference between financial independence and FIRE?
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.360]   Yeah, well, that's a great question.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.760]   So, okay, FIRE, the definition, so we're financial independence, retire early.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.520]   And now that was en vogue certainly five to 10 years ago.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.960]   It was this really, there's an allure to it.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.400]   And frankly, Chris, it's that cute little acronym, right?
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.240]   Like FIRE just sounds cool.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.760]   Like, "Hey, I'm pursuing FIRE."
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.280]   But honestly, there was so much overemphasis on the retire early
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360]   that it just became this horrible distraction.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.400]   And there are just people really just crapping on,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.720]   hold on, I don't want to say this, Andrew, cut that.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.800]   And there are just people who love to rip on the FIRE movement
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.160]   because all they hear is that R-E.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.880]   And it really takes away from people who are pursuing
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.440]   financial independence to live a better life.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.800]   And that is how I see, I see financial independence as a universal good
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.160]   in that people are resting control of their lives back from this elusive they, right?
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360]   Like you always hear the doom and gloom of you can never retire.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.480]   It's impossible.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.680]   You need 10 to $20 million to retire.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.600]   Healthcare is going to be unaffordable.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.880]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.600]   You can't do this.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.320]   You can't do this.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.520]   It's impossible.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.040]   As opposed to reorienting around what can you control?
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   And you, to a large degree, can control your expenses.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.840]   And now, again, this is probably where people overemphasize just the cutting.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.800]   And Chris, obviously we'll talk about that in depth here today,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.080]   but you can control what does your life cost?
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.520]   And then essentially you can say, okay, I take, what does my life cost per year?
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   And then multiply by some number.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.440]   It's usually by 25.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.240]   So let's say your life costs $80,000 a year.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.640]   Multiply by 25, that's $2 million.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.960]   That's your five number, your financial independence number.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.880]   Because I think many of us, most of us have heard of the 4% rule
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.400]   where we're not going to get into this really in-depth here today.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.640]   But in essence, you can pull 4% out of your investable assets.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.000]   So again, we'll turn it around and say that $2 million times 0.04 is $80,000, right?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.360]   So it's just the inverse of where we started at 80,000 for the expenses.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.760]   So that $2 million can spit off 80K to cover your living expenses.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.120]   Now it is indexed for inflation, normal inflation, not the inflation we've seen recently.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.320]   So there are some potential adjustments, but I think some people have some people adjust
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.680]   for that is say, okay, maybe I want to be a little more conservative and make it 30 times
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.040]   my expenses or 33 times something, something like that.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.360]   Right.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.960]   So you can, you can play with this at the margins, because I think really the essence
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.720]   of it is you actually have some degree of certainty and you have something to shoot
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   for maybe for the first time in your life.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.160]   And it's not just this doom and gloom of, oh, you can never do this.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.440]   You can never do that.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.160]   There's some elusive day that's going to impact you.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160]   It's you can control that.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.880]   So yeah, how does that sound for a rough definition?
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.240]   No, no, it makes sense.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.120]   And I will come back at some point to the 4% rule because I have some thoughts.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.960]   But, you know, when I think about financial independence on one perspective, it doesn't
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.280]   even have to get that detailed.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.800]   It's, you know, you could have a large emergency fund and that's a form of financial independence
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   because it gives you time to look for the right job.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.000]   You know, every bit of savings that gives you some flexibility is layering in financial
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.040]   independence.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   And sure, when you get to the point that your savings can cover your entire life and you
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.880]   can choose not to work, to work, to work for free, obviously, you know, that's even more
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.520]   independence.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.240]   And if you truly could replace your entire income, then yeah, you could retire early
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.740]   per se.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.640]   The irony is that most people end up using their free time to do things that very much
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.200]   resemble work and very often generate income and they're not truly retiring early.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   But I think that's why it's actually helpful.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.480]   As much as I thought it was confusing that there are many different types of fire, it
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.400]   was actually helpful to look at them and talk about what they are because it gave some perspective
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:17.360]   to the concept that it's not all about one particular style, which I think historically
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.840]   it has been.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.480]   It's always been saving up enough money so you have 25 times your income and don't think
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.280]   about anything else.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.600]   Yeah, I think you're spot on.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.120]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.280]   And that is why that caricature existed, right?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.360]   It's like this was for a very specific type of person is what it seemed like high income,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.880]   maybe in a tech job, maybe a white guy in his 30s, right?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.640]   Because some of the very famous early fire bloggers, I guess I even have a hard time
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.680]   saying it at this point, Chris, the early fire bloggers were fit that caricature, right?
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.960]   Or fit that profile, let's say.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   So I agree with you that A, nobody that I know of actually just sits on their butt and
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.440]   retires and doesn't do anything.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.480]   Most people, if they had the wherewithal to reach financial independence at some fairly
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.320]   early point or expedited time, they are going to do fantastic things.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.120]   Like you said, they're going to earn money somehow.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.720]   They're going to add value to the world.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.240]   They're going to do interesting and varied things.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.640]   And to imagine this again, you can tell I get bothered by this, right?
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.120]   So like that, they're just going to sit there and do nothing and sip umbrella drinks.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.680]   It's like, it's just so silly and laughable, which is why like to focus on the RE makes
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.480]   no sense.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.400]   And then, like you said, the power starts accruing essentially from day one, right?
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   It's like that first time, if you're living paycheck to paycheck and you're now all of
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.000]   a sudden you found out about ChooseFI and you're pursuing financial independence,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   okay, maybe it's not going to take you 10 years to get to five.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.160]   Maybe it's going to take you 20 years.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.320]   Maybe it's going to take you how many every year?
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.440]   It almost doesn't even matter.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.680]   But your life is vastly better that first time you have $5,000 saved up.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.040]   Even $1,000, right?
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   Like, Chris, how many people live paycheck to paycheck and think that an emergency is
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.400]   a $200 expense that came out of the blue, but was perfectly foreseeable in a given year?
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   But that to them is an emergency.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.960]   But it's really not, right?
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.880]   Like, it's just life is lumpy.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.920]   Expenses are lumpy.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.280]   That's the way it works.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.000]   But man, that first time they have $1,000 saved up, $5,000 saved up, like their life
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.600]   is dramatically better.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.800]   So yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.000]   Like the FI journey starts from day one.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.280]   And I think that power starts accruing from day one.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.680]   And I think it really radically transforms people and their entire mindset.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.520]   Yeah, I think a handful of people I knew, myself included, probably went off the deep
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.240]   end with one version of it in our minds.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.320]   I'm going to run through because there's an unlimited number of types of financial
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.360]   independence, right?
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.800]   They're ones that I will leave off and maybe they're ones you're excited about.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.200]   But I'm just going to share a few of the ones.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.640]   I wrote down a couple quick definitions, because I think having a few options of what
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.200]   financial independence could be actually gives you more flexibility.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   So the one we talked about, just traditional fire is have enough money to quit your job
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.400]   and never work again.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.080]   But the other 4 are pretty interesting.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.280]   So I'm going to talk about first with lean fire, which would be the very tight end of
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:35.200]   the spectrum, which is retiring early, but bringing your expectation for expenses way
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.640]   down, really tightening your belt so that you can do it even earlier.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.560]   And I would say this one probably gets a lot more flack than practically shows up.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.960]   But this is I am going to change where I live, change what I eat, change the activities I
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.400]   do so I can stop working.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.160]   And I don't know.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.200]   I'll run through them all and we can talk about them.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.240]   The next one, which is interesting, is kind of coast fire.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.280]   And it's most interesting to me because I didn't really actually understand what it
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.780]   meant.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.280]   I thought it was a version of fire for people who live on the coasts where cost of living
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.080]   is higher.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.520]   But it turns out it's actually instead of focusing on saving up enough money so that
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:24.480]   you can stop working, it's saving up enough money so that you can stop contributing towards
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.840]   retirement, whatever time in the future that might be.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.000]   So let's say you're fine working till you're 65, fill up your retirement accounts enough
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.960]   early on so that all of your income each year can just go to life and not go towards savings,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.120]   which dovetails into another option, which is called barista fire, which is...
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.680]   And then you could choose to make a lot of money and spend a lot of money, or you could
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.600]   choose to just have a side job that only covers the expenses because you don't need to contribute
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.400]   to your savings.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.960]   And so you could take a less stressful job.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.040]   You could take a job that earns less income.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.600]   And by the way, this is all a spectrum, right?
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.880]   If in order to meet your retirement needs, you need to save $30,000 a year, it's not
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.600]   zero or 30, you could lower your income.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.000]   There's stops along the way.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.840]   And then the last one that I'll mention is Fatfire, which has a wonderful Reddit community
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.040]   and Facebook group, which is really just not sacrificing, right?
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.400]   It's like, "I would like to save up enough money so that I'm not beholden to a job.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.240]   I'm not beholden to anything.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.440]   But I don't want to sacrifice.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.600]   I want to be able to go on really nice vacations.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.720]   I want to be able to travel around the world, eat at whatever restaurants I want to and
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.040]   spend money and live in a nice house and choose to live in the Bay Area, even if I'm not working
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.400]   or wherever it is for you."
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   So I think that's like, "I want to live whatever life I want on my savings and not
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.280]   stress out about it."
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.640]   And I don't know, I'm curious what you think when you hear all of these things, whether
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.840]   you're like, "This is silly.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.640]   This is helpful."
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.360]   Yeah, I think it's helpful.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.880]   I think it's mostly helpful.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.960]   And like you said, there are a lot of these different ones.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.000]   I think these are the four probably main ones that I've heard of.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.440]   I suspect there are some that you and I have never even heard of at this point.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   But yeah, I think, like you said, lean fire is probably the one that appeals to me least.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.520]   But I suspect it's maybe, I don't know.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.880]   The easiest to achieve.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.440]   It's easy.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.960]   It's certainly easiest to achieve.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.880]   Yeah, it's the old school.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.360]   It's like essentially how little could you humanly spend more or less to live?
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:45.200]   And then have you achieved FI based on probably the 25 times rule based on that?
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:51.920]   So let's say your life, maybe just your actual structural expenses and some food to get by
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.720]   costs $30,000, right?
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.880]   Well, okay, then your lean FI is $750,000, which is very doable for a lot of people.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:06.400]   I mean, Chris, I can't imagine that sounds like a very appealing life to either me or
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.800]   you, but I can understand why people potentially pursue this.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.360]   What I think is interesting, and it's something I've actually said a lot, and I guess maybe
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.840]   I've been describing lean fire, is that it's helpful for me to have the security to know
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.880]   that I've saved enough money, that there is a lifestyle I could live, especially once
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.160]   you have a family and children.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:35.120]   If you have that $750,000, and something happens, you lose your ability to work.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.800]   Knowing that there is a place in the world that you could live, maybe even in the US,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.840]   maybe even nearby, there is an ability to buy food, feed your family.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.000]   That's a lot of security.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.040]   It gives you the flexibility to do a lot of things in your life and be a lot less worried.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.280]   Now, it's not enough money to live in a major city and go out and take expensive vacations,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   but it will give you some peace of mind.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.680]   I think the challenge is, when you get to the point that you hit it, do you really want
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.840]   to stop, do nothing for the rest of your life, and live that life or keep going?
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.920]   So to me, there are stops along the journey that start with being out of debt, start with
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.760]   being able to pay off... Well, let's skip that.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.120]   It starts with being out of debt, building up savings and whatnot.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.480]   But I think what I've seen in my life, leaving to start this podcast, my wife leaving to
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.960]   join me, those were things we were able to do because we have savings.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.200]   Do we have enough savings that we could live off of it in our current lifestyle with zero
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.680]   income?
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.640]   Probably not.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.320]   But do we have enough savings that we could adapt our lifestyle, move somewhere else and
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.960]   live off it?
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.600]   Yes.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.040]   And that gives us a lot of comfort.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.360]   Yeah, the security.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.840]   I mean, there's a real allure to that, certainly.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.720]   And I don't think any of these are all or nothing, I mean, especially something like
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.520]   LeanFi.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.160]   So I mean, I can use the example of my brother and his wife and family.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:10.800]   They, I mean, maybe you could call it a mini-retirement, but there's some intersection of a mini-retirement
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:18.480]   and LeanFi in that they just had a daughter and she's a year old now.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.160]   And basically, he was staying home to raise her for the first year.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:30.240]   And then his wife, Kristen, realized, "Hey, I don't want to miss this time.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.560]   This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:40.480]   We're not at Fi, but we're certainly at a LeanFi number where we could easily live off
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.320]   the 4% rule based on earning zero income."
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.960]   So they wound up almost doing exactly what you described, Chris, which was, "Hey, maybe
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.520]   you could even do this within the United States."
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.400]   They moved to Wisconsin, where she's from.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.040]   They bought a condo, don't have a mortgage on it.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:05.680]   And they're living for a year or two or maybe even more in this LeanFi style.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:12.800]   But the benefit they're getting is they're seeing those first formative years of their
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.040]   daughter's life as a family.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   And the three of them are there every single day.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   So you talk about security, but you also talk about benefits of something.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.840]   I mean, that is literally priceless.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.600]   And I mean, I don't know precisely what's going on in their lives, but are they going
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.840]   out to fancy dinners all the time?
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.040]   Are they doing this and that?
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.400]   No, but man, they're there with their daughter every single day.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.280]   And that's an astonishing, astonishing thing.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.920]   I think you could choose what you want to do with your financial independence.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.760]   You could choose how it exists.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   But let's come back to CoastFi because it's the most interesting one to me because it
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.400]   feels like what I'm interested in and what I actually would care about more than quitting
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.600]   my job is having the flexibility to work, but also save.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.880]   I'm curious what you think.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.320]   So it's funny, actually, that today is the day you found CoastFi, right?
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.120]   And you realized, oh, wow, this is interesting to me.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.640]   This is what I'm living at this point.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.760]   And yeah, I mean, I think this has a real appeal to a lot of people.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.360]   This is maybe one of the newer of these flavors of Fi, but it was one of those aha moments
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.840]   for a lot of people in that, yeah, I mean, essentially, and Chris, obviously, there's
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.480]   the intersection of like the rule of 72 and compounding money.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.920]   So just to take a quick sidebar and explain that is I think most people understand that,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.160]   okay, you have some investable net worth saved up, right?
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:49.120]   And while we can't guarantee what a stock market return is, I think you have a general
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.600]   annual return over a long period of time.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.160]   Like at ChooseFi, we generally say 8%.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.760]   We use that as the back of the envelope.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.880]   So using what's known as the rule of 72, and I don't want to get in the weeds here, but
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.080]   this is actually a really useful and pretty easy thing to figure out is it basically tells
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   you how long it'll take for your assets to double based on a certain rate of return.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   So more or less, you just take the number 72 and then divide by your expected rate of
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   return.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.120]   If we're saying 8%, so 72 divided by 8 very simply is 9.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.920]   That's the number of years it'll take your money to double.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:34.960]   So that's really, really important for CoastFi in that basically how CoastFi works is let's
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.520]   say you've saved up, I don't know, 300,000, let's start there.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.800]   Something that's reasonable and is certainly a nice net worth, but is not going to get
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.680]   just about anybody to buy, right?
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:54.240]   So you've saved up 300,000 and now you want to not save any more money.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.520]   That's the part of coasting.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.840]   You're not saving additional money into your, hold on, sorry, let me say that again.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.200]   So that's the point where coasting comes in is essentially your money is working for you
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.440]   in the background and you are not adding anything to those assets.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440]   You're not saving.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.600]   You are either earning less and spending it all or potentially spending more money, right?
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.560]   Or potentially spending more money and just increasing your lifestyle to meet where your
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560]   income is.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.640]   So either way, not a bad option, right?
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:35.000]   And basically using that rule of 72, let's say your actual fine number was, I don't know,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.160]   1.2 million just to make the math easy.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.960]   So that 300,000 will double to 600,000 in nine years.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.080]   And then that 600 will double again to 1.2 million in 18 years total.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.280]   So 18 years from now, if you had a $300,000 net worth, again, in theory, we're not saying
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.760]   this is a guarantee, but assuming an 8% annual return, it would be 1.2 million in about 18
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.760]   years.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.720]   And at that point you would be fine.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.040]   So you're more or less coasting into it based on the work that you've done previously by
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.080]   saving in this concerted manner to get your current net worth.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.560]   And yeah, I mean, Chris, I think there really is a great allure to that.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.160]   I know, again, this is something that you're thinking about in your own life, right?
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:28.400]   You clearly have a nice net worth, but I think you are not at fi as you would traditionally
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   define it, right?
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   I mean, it's funny because 10 years ago, I probably would have said yes.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.560]   Then you have children, you move into the Bay Area, and you spend a lot...
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.280]   You realize how much more money you're spending and you come out of it.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.760]   So it's like you can come into it, you can come out of it.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:49.400]   For me, I think we've saved enough that it'll cover retirement if it continues to grow.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.840]   And that we can not focus as much on saving in the short term.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.080]   But we do need to focus on covering our expenses.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.200]   And so that's where I think it seems like, "Oh, I could do whatever I want."
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   No, no, no.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.640]   Can't do whatever we want.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.400]   Still need a reasonably high pre-tax income to cover where we live and how much we spend
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.320]   each year and probably will save more.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:19.760]   But in a strange way, for me, it's weird to ever withdraw money from your savings.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.320]   So for me, the money we put away in our brokerage account, our retirement accounts, that's for
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   retirement.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.460]   That starts TBD.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.440]   I feel weird taking money out of it.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:35.520]   The strange thing in this new kind of Coast Fi world that I'm hours into is this idea
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.280]   that, "Well, maybe it makes sense to withdraw some of it so that we can put other money
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.560]   we make into more tax-advantaged accounts."
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.700]   So I could actually see a start to draw down on our long-term savings, which for us is
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:56.080]   in our Wealthfront account, so that we can increase our solo 401(k) contributions because
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.020]   there's just a more tax advantage to doing that.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.720]   That's something that we'll probably still do.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.240]   So we're still going to save, but we're going to also withdraw at the same time, which I'm
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.720]   sure will make some financial model confused.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.960]   But I think for us, this feels...
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.440]   It feels like the first time I found a part of the FIRE movement, if you will, that I'm
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   like, "Oh, this makes sense now."
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.200]   I don't necessarily want to quit my job.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.720]   And I think a lot of people I talk to don't want to quit their job, or at least don't
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.880]   want to stop working.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.160]   And so the one nuance to calculating this is thinking, "When do I want to stop working?"
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.940]   Work backwards from there to figure out how much you need now.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:40.360]   So like you said, if you want to stop working in 18 years, I'm a bit more conservative.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.160]   I probably use 6%.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.380]   So for me, that takes your 18 to 25.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:53.520]   So if you're cool with a 65-year retirement age, and you want to work backwards, by 40,
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.800]   you need one-fourth of what you think you need to live on in retirement.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.960]   So if that number is $1 million, you need $250 because you're not going to touch it.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.000]   It's just going to grow until that day.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.980]   We could go down a lot of rabbit holes here.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.500]   But I've been really intrigued.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:15.620]   I will say, I will just take a quick tackle on the 4% rule because I went down the Early
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:24.240]   Retirement Now website, which had this great whole thing on safe withdrawal rates and sequence
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   of return risk and everything.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.480]   It was like a 60-part blog post series, which I will just say is a lot.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.720]   I'll link to the first one in the show notes.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:40.180]   But I think the 4% rule often gets misinterpreted because it was truly built for a 30-year cycle
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.940]   to end at zero.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:49.300]   And so if you're using the 4% rule, starting at age 30, the certainty with which it has
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.700]   worked in the Trinity study that it was based off of would have only gotten you to age 60.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.100]   However, if you look at a lot of the calculations and the Early Retirement Now blog actually
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:07.460]   has a lot of them, you'll notice that if you just reduce it to 3.5% or even 3%, it works
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.460]   in perpetuity.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:13.020]   So if you want to be really safe, which is what I do in all my projections, I use the
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.140]   3% rule.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.300]   I'm probably underselling things.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.900]   I'm also not factoring in Social Security or anything else.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.740]   But that's where I come out with on the 4% rule.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:31.140]   I think for a handful of reasons, it's probably both too aggressive to be certain and too
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.380]   conservative for what I imagine we will see with returns.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.380]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.380]   Right?
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.540]   And yeah, Karsten.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.460]   So listeners of ChooseFI will be very familiar with Karsten from Early Retirement Now.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.100]   He is just an amazing, amazing intellect.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.020]   And yeah, like you said, if you're looking to dive deep on safe withdrawal rates, his
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.740]   60-part series, it's almost laughable to say 60-part series out loud, but yeah, it is amazing.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   And yeah.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.460]   And by the way, each part is not like three paragraphs.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.060]   Each part is like seven pages of content.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.060]   Right.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.580]   Thousands of words and graphs and charts and stuff.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.580]   But right.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.180]   I think on our show, he basically has said it's almost a guarantee, and he would never
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:19.220]   use the word guarantee, but in every Monte Carlo simulation he's come up with, that 3.25%
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.060]   will get you there in virtually every single scenario.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.740]   So like you said, using a 3% safe withdrawal rate is very, very conservative and not including
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.740]   social security.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.900]   I mean, we're all, I think those of us that are inclined to think that way, and I am as
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.380]   well, because I mean, I use that 33 times.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.140]   So that's the 3% rule, 33 times your annual expenses.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:47.260]   I think we all understand we're being ultra, ultra conservative, but again, a lot of this,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.780]   a lot of personal finance is psychology.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.220]   It's more than it is numbers.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:56.460]   And I think if that helps you sleep well at night, because again, that word security,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.460]   right?
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.460]   We'll come back to that.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.820]   I think that is a really important word.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.460]   It's a really important concept.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.020]   And if that helps you sleep well at night, then so be it.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.020]   It's fine.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.900]   Like, but you have to understand like, what's the opportunity cost, right?
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:14.020]   So the opportunity costs potentially are years of your life that you're working.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:19.780]   Now, if like you, you're doing something that you love, and again, I just wrote down as
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:25.240]   you were talking, like, who says you have to stop working as if you need to stop working
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.740]   to be part of the fire movement or something like that nonsense is gone.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.940]   It was gone years ago.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.460]   Like, that's not a prerequisite to being a member of the financial independence movement,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.460]   certainly.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.700]   And like, you can do what you want.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.340]   That's the whole beauty of this, Chris, right?
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.020]   Like, you have the freedom to do what you want in life.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.660]   And if that means you want to work because you love it, then do it.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.660]   That's great.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.660]   But do it on your own terms.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.660]   Right?
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   So I think, again, we're being a little conservative, but that's okay.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.860]   Again, understanding what's the opportunity cost and for people who are working in jobs
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.900]   that they don't love, and that it's that one more year syndrome, how many people fall prey
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   to that?
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.380]   Like, oh, I don't feel safe enough yet.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.500]   I don't feel safe enough.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.940]   What if I need the 2.5% safe withdrawal rate?
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.660]   What about 2.25%?
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.980]   And I don't think Social Security is going to be here.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.660]   You know, you can come up with all of this stuff that will keep you working in a job
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.380]   that you potentially hate forever.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.340]   And that's not a good alternative either.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:30.020]   So clearly, I'm kind of setting up almost like a straw man ridiculous argument here,
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   Chris.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:37.300]   But like, but maybe not, because I fear there are people that could fall prey to that.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.800]   I think the one thing that you got to remember is that it's not binary.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.860]   If you have a job you hate, you don't have to just quit that job and never work again
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:52.220]   and be able to replace your income for the next 30 to 60 years.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:58.580]   If you build up enough to get you by for a year, then you can go try to find another
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.700]   job that you might like more.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.220]   And it turns out, if you love it more, you might be able to advance better, negotiate
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.820]   a salary better, be more productive.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.140]   You might end up making more money in the long run.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.520]   I know a lot of people that find themselves sometimes in their career not happy with their
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   job.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.920]   And if I look back now that I've kind of had the professional experience, most of them
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.980]   found other things pretty quickly that they loved.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.940]   Some took longer than they needed.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.060]   So a lot of them worried that they couldn't quit their job because they needed enough
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.420]   money, millions of dollars to cover their income forever.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.540]   And I know that because I was one of them.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.780]   But I quickly found other things that I loved.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:42.180]   And so, put together, that's more of an emergency fund issue than a financial independence issue.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:49.100]   You don't need to have your entire life covered in costs before you can take time to find
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.100]   something you love.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.340]   And I have a good friend who did this.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.200]   He knew he was ready to find something new and knew that it might take a year and had
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.060]   enough savings to do that.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.960]   Didn't think he needed financial independence, retire early money.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.720]   And about six months in, he found a thing that he's really, really excited about.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.540]   And it took time, but he's going to be much happier.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.360]   And I think his career will flourish because of it.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.720]   So I don't know, that's just one perspective I have.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   No, that's really cool.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.920]   I mean, that resonates with me in my own life, frankly, and you as well, right?
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.800]   We both did this with our own entrepreneurial ventures.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   And it's cool to have options.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.000]   And I think that's what pursuing FI gives you.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.640]   It gives you options that if, I mean, for me, if I didn't have any type of side business
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.200]   and I was just, I mean, I was a middle manager at doing corporate state tax returns.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.480]   I was a CPA and I was on the path to FI.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.920]   I was still a number of years away and I had built businesses on the side.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   I mean, Chris, they weren't bringing in a ton of money, but it was something that like
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.880]   I had proved the concept to myself.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.760]   And I said, Oh, if I could actually do this full time, maybe I could turn this into something.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.760]   And it's, you know, in the points and miles world, you didn't even realize, I don't think
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.680]   all this time that we've known each other, that that was really my first foray into entrepreneurship
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   was through points and miles.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.600]   And it was for basically regular people.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.680]   I was helping people get to Disney world, take Disney world trips, not first class on
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.520]   Singapore suites or anything like that.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:28.720]   But literally trips to Disney world, because I figured if they were, if I, if I could save
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.360]   $4,000 for my family, there were millions of other families who want to go to Disney
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   world.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.360]   And yeah.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.040]   Is that super attractive to a 24 year old kid who's looking to fly first class and,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.560]   and do all the travel hacking type of stuff?
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.560]   No.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.520]   But is that appealing to tens of millions of families who want to go to Disney world?
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.720]   Yeah, you bet.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.680]   And then I kind of scaled that with my next business travel miles one-on-one and, and
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.720]   it was just, I wouldn't have had that opportunity.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.560]   I wouldn't have had the guts, frankly, to leave my job, my nice safe job when I had
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.360]   two daughters and a wife.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.840]   If I didn't, if I wasn't pursuing fine, if I wasn't 80% of the way to my fine number,
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.080]   it was that, that security blanket, it made a massive difference, you know?
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.600]   So you said 80%.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.240]   So I'm curious, how are you tracking this?
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:21.080]   I downloaded Karsten's toolkit, which is a spreadsheet that I didn't even...
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:25.000]   I spent about 20 minutes on it and I made it about 10% or less the way there, which
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.280]   is not to say it's not a helpful tool.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   But I think there's a world where you can go down a lot of rabbit holes.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.160]   So just to be clear, his tool is incredible, especially when it comes to modeling a lot
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.440]   of the things he talks about.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.320]   If you want to nerd out, I'll also link to that in the show notes.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.440]   But high level, what are the tools you're using on a daily basis to kind of manage your
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.160]   money and track your financial independence journey?
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.960]   Well, you, the AllTheHacks guy, are going to be very disappointed in me.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:59.000]   I am as low-key and low-tech with this as one could possibly be.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.240]   I still use the Excel, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that I've been using for like my entire FI
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   journey.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:15.920]   I have it literally quarter by quarter saved, my net worth saved for the last 10 plus years
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   now.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.200]   And which is actually a really cool exercise.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.920]   I just love, and I know our good friend Paula Pant does this as well, just loves really
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:30.720]   getting into the nitty gritty of like, I know it sounds silly, but entering those numbers
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:38.220]   into the spreadsheet, there's something really visceral about it that is better for me personally
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.280]   than using some fancy tool or some fancy projection software.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.200]   And I know you've dove into a whole bunch of these things.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   So I want to get back to you on this because you have a better answer.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.120]   But yeah, I mean, I very simply, I have my CPA's brain.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.720]   So I've come up with like income statements and net worth statements that I just track
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.280]   in Excel.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.680]   And I basically maybe spend an hour every month just kind of really tying everything
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.000]   out to, I run everything through my checking account.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.920]   So I use that as the account that I run everything off of and then any transfers into other accounts.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:21.040]   And then obviously increases or decreases in the account balances at Vanguard or Fidelity
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.200]   or Schwab or Wealthfront or wherever it may be.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.480]   And that then ties out to my net worth.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:33.000]   So basically I'm doing this probably, like I said, about an hour a month, give or take
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.200]   to track my checking account.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:41.280]   And then at the end of every quarter, I spend probably no more than 30 minutes logging into
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:47.960]   every account that I own, that I have assets at and just jotting down in this Excel spreadsheet
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.520]   my balance there.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.120]   So it ultimately then ties out to my, I get my net worth.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.280]   So it's been, yeah, I know it sounds like a lot of work.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   It's really not.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.120]   And there's something, there is something fun about it.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.680]   So I know that doesn't appeal to you at all.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.740]   But yeah, tell us about where the rabbit holes you've dove down.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.800]   Obviously I took a more tech forward approach than a spreadsheet, although I used the spreadsheet
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   for a long time.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.600]   But I just found that if I didn't update it for 6 months, it was just a lot of work.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.760]   So I think that for everyone, there's 2 to 3 tools.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.680]   And I think for a lot of people, it can just be 2.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.580]   And all of the stuff we've talked about this entire episode really comes down to knowing
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.880]   2 things.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.520]   It's knowing how much you're spending and knowing how much you have.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.240]   And I guess knowing how much you make also, but that's usually a lot easier number for
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.380]   a lot of people to peg.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.920]   And so it's how do you track your spending and how do you track your net worth?
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.800]   And how do you project from that would be the third piece of the puzzle.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.120]   I used to try to track spending in Mint along many years ago.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.160]   I've done an entire episode where I broke down...
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.520]   I actually went and used all the tools.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:11.840]   Mint, YNAB, Monarch Money, Copilot, the one that Quicken launched, Simplify, and a couple
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   others.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   And I played with all of them.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.700]   I synced all my 2022 transactions, looked at everything.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.800]   And the end goal was like, "I'm going to pick the best one."
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.660]   I had some ideas of what it would be.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.200]   But at the end of the day, I went with Copilot.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.380]   I think it's for anyone who's on Apple products, it's the best.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:38.320]   If you're on Android or Windows, it's an iOS, Mac, iPad-only adventure.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:48.000]   But for me, it almost makes it so easy and fun and simple and that's just what I've chosen.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.460]   Right after I reached out to them and I was like, "Hey guys, I've been pitched by a handful
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.200]   of companies in this space to work with them as sponsors of the podcast.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   But at the end of the day, I want to work with the products I use."
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.680]   And that's how I've actually done most of the sponsorships we have.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.120]   So I did end up working with them.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.840]   So full disclosure, they are a partner of the show.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.640]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/copilot, you'll get a discount.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.080]   But I think that is how I manage how much I spend.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.760]   I did a whole episode on all that, so I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:25.800]   Then for how much money I have generally, Wealthfront has a free version of linking
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.520]   your accounts, seeing how it's going, doing some light projections.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.640]   I'd put it in the "I don't want to play around a lot.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:37.820]   I want you to give me best practices on everything."
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:43.640]   What I think goes a step further than that is a product called Kubera, which I first
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.760]   heard about at FinCon, when they presented on stage, I later started using.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.800]   And then later, I would say partnered with, they're not a sponsor of the show.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.240]   But we worked together on the All The Hacks membership.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.700]   So All The Hacks members get their first year of Kubera free.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.560]   Both of these tools are not free.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.880]   So your option of a spreadsheet is free.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.360]   My option of 2 apps, I pay for both of them.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.320]   They're not huge expenses.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:17.120]   But I think Kubera is like, imagine if someone wanted to build the website version of the
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.040]   spreadsheet you have, where you can put it in categories, you can look at...
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.280]   Especially on the investment side, you can look at cost bases or IRRs.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.560]   But they're calculating it all for you.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.440]   They're pulling all the info.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.160]   And then they just launched recently this fast forward feature, where you can put in
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.240]   a set of simple rules in multiple scenarios and be able to just see what happens.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:45.560]   So this isn't the full on financial projection tool that you could go down every rabbit hole
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.980]   of tax assumptions and everything.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   But you could say...
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.980]   And I'm looking at mine.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:56.320]   It's like, let's say my assets grow by 3% factoring in inflation.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.400]   Let's say my salary continues for this many years.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.420]   Let's say inflation is this.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.280]   Let's say I have a future expense for college starting in this year, lasting for 4 years.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.240]   Kind of some simple rules.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   On mine, I have 6.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.880]   And it'll project forward and say, "Here's your net worth in a year, 5 years, 10 years,
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.520]   20 years, and what that will generally look like."
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.000]   So I think Kubera...
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.880]   I've abandoned my spreadsheet for Kubera for tracking net worth and everything.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.520]   It syncs with...
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.560]   The thing that I think has always been the problem is there are a handful of providers
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.920]   of linking services, meaning where you'd log into your bank account and they'll pull data
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   on a read-only basis.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.820]   And most apps use one and Kubera works with 2 or 3 of the top ones.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.600]   So they know that if you're trying to sync that obscure Vanguard, a census retirement
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.760]   account that I have, they know to make sure you use Yodlee instead of Plaid because it
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.760]   syncs better.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.320]   So I love that.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.440]   And so Kubera.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:05.960]   And then the third one is one that I recently started playing with after a bunch of listeners
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.520]   emailed in and said, "Hey, you haven't included Projection Lab."
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.600]   And so I said, "Oh, you're right.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.960]   I haven't included Projection Lab.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.560]   I'll make sure at some point to go look into it."
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.320]   And I had a call actually with Kyle, the CEO or the founder of this company.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.520]   And it's really interesting.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.960]   I think if you're the kind of person that wants to model out a lot of scenarios, toggle
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.640]   things on and off, look at the tax implications, look at the flow of capital on a year-by-year
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.160]   basis, Projection Lab is amazing.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.600]   I will say, I think jumping into it, it's not going to be the "I want to set up 3 simple
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   rules."
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.480]   There's an onboarding and you walk through a lot of stuff.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.360]   But once you're done, the flexibility you have is really cool.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.840]   And you can define steps along the way like, "I want to get to...
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.520]   When will I get to financial independence at 33 times income?
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.760]   When might I get to fat fire at 50 times income?"
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.480]   You can set these milestones and see these projections.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:11.560]   So I would say if someone needs an app to track their spending, I'm a fan of Copilot.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.760]   If someone wants to track their net worth, I'm a big fan of Kubera.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.640]   And if you're an All The Hacks member or want to be, it's free for your first year, which
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.240]   is cool.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.480]   And then finally, I would say if you want to go really deep in the weeds, you can use
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   Projection Lab.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.760]   And I don't say "deep in the weeds" like it's not interesting for most people.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   I just...
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.200]   You're going to spend more time on it and if your money is important.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   Some people...
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   I love putting my money on autopilot.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   But if I'm trying to figure out big decisions, I like having all the data.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.800]   And so right now, we're looking at school.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:51.200]   If we ended up paying for college or doing private school, what are those huge costs
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.080]   what kind of impact do they have?
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.960]   And I think those are really interesting questions to ask.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.760]   And when you want to factor in the taxes of it, and you want to factor in required minimum
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.680]   distributions from retirement accounts, it's pretty interesting.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.880]   Yeah, you showed it to me right before we jumped on.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.000]   And yeah, it looked fantastic.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.640]   And there is a spectrum, right?
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:17.360]   I mean, clearly, I think we are the spectrum here of mine is aside from people who aren't
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.880]   tracking anything, which please, please, please, please track something.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.240]   You just need to at the very least, what do you spend?
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.360]   What's your net worth?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   You need to do that.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.560]   Up to you who are trying out all these different tools and want to get it.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.520]   I would say by any measure, you are being more accurate than I am, right?
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:44.400]   And having these major expenses, like just seeing that, "Oh, hey, from, in my case, 2026
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.760]   to 2034, I'm going to have college for each of my daughters.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.760]   It's going to be eight straight years of college."
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   That clearly needs to be factored in somehow, right?
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:01.320]   And if I was earning $0, then we would potentially have an issue.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.560]   Am I really at phi?
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:08.520]   And I think it's an interesting thought experiment in my case, but for a lot of people, hey,
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:15.120]   if you've "reach phi" and you're not, maybe you're earning a fraction of what you were,
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.200]   and you have these massive expenses coming up that you haven't modeled, well, there are
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.160]   many of these software options.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.720]   I know there's a new retirement.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.560]   I think there's on trajectory.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.240]   I've just loosely seen those in the past, but yeah, this Projection Lab looks amazing.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.840]   And just to be clear, normally when I want to do an episode on this, I'll go play with
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.060]   every tool.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:41.700]   And so Projection Lab does not get the seal of, "I have gone and played with every tool."
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.240]   But I just got so many emails from listeners to check it out.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.560]   And many of those people have gone and played with every tool that I thought it was worth
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.680]   looking at.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:55.880]   But honestly, I say that because I enjoyed spending an afternoon going to enter it in,
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:02.040]   but I equally enjoyed, on Kubera, creating 4 or 5 or I guess 6 rules.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.240]   It's like "To college", "Growth", "Inflation", "When does my income end?" and "How do my
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.840]   expenses change?"
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.200]   And just having a very simple form of "How do things project out to the future?"
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:19.360]   So I care more about people being aware of the circumstance than I do about them going
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.120]   deep, deep down rabbit holes.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.400]   But those are the 3 tools that I say all of my financial life lives through.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.840]   It's not related to business.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   There's quick books for business and all that stuff.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   But for me, it's those 3 tools are how I'm doing almost all the tracking.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.360]   And we'll see where Projection Lab fits in, in the long run, whether it's a thing I check
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.520]   every month, every year, or whether it's a thing I use to make big decisions.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.640]   No, that makes perfect sense.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.480]   And Chris, I actually wanted to double back to something you said before, because I think
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.300]   there might be some people who are looking for some additional clarity on this.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.920]   So we were talking about LeanFi.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:04.040]   You were saying that you were potentially going to be taking money out of some accounts.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:09.320]   It sounded like your taxable brokerage account, but you're going to be putting money in also
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:14.200]   into let's say, solo 401(k) or some other pre-tax options.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.960]   You mentioned that very much in passing.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   And I always love to close the loop on things.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.400]   Can you give a little more detail on that?
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.880]   Because I think there are going to be a lot of people who are like, "Chris, I want more
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.880]   info on this."
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.800]   Like the real nuts and bolts of how people are doing this.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.920]   I mean, I think I did some aggressive saving early on and built up a good taxable brokerage
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   account.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:43.120]   Now, we could have a whole conversation about what was the deprivation of skipping dinners,
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.400]   not ordering appetizers, like was all that worth it?
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.040]   Conversation for another day.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.880]   So now, most of my savings is non-retirement savings.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.840]   However, and our expenses have gone up.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:04.060]   And right now, with Amy leaving her job to work on all the hacks, I would say our income
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.120]   has gone down.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.240]   Twelve months ago, we had two jobs and a podcast and now we have zero jobs and a podcast.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:21.800]   And so, we just frankly do not have the income right now to both live and contribute to retirement
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   accounts.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.600]   And that's not to say we're in a...
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   You should feel bad.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.860]   No, we're in a fine financial position.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:32.600]   It's just if you look practically at the dollars coming in, all the expenses we have related
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:40.400]   to the podcast, employee, we have a full-time employee, all this stuff, practically, we
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:45.560]   want to cover our expenses and there's just not a big buffer left over to fund retirement
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   accounts.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:53.480]   However, there are a lot of great options, whether it's Backdoor Roth IRAs, or Solo 401Ks,
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   or...
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:00.800]   I just got this cool email about this option that I'm not entirely sure how it works, but
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.840]   something that goes one step even further than just Solo 401Ks, it was called a Cash
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.800]   Balance Plan.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   So I just read this description.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.620]   I'm just going to read this description.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:17.260]   This is an advanced retirement plan for business owners that are making mid-hundreds of thousands
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:22.840]   of dollars a year in profit and want to put away more than the $66,000 a year Solo 401K
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   plan allows.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.560]   It costs considerably more to set up, about $2,000 to set up and maintain each year.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.680]   But it's unparalleled in the size of the benefit, and it can be combined with the Solo 401K.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.200]   So I don't even think...
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.240]   When I read this, I wasn't thinking, "This is for me."
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.520]   I was just thinking, it made me realize that there are a lot of things as a business owner,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.160]   or even if you were just an employee, that you could use your money to be more tax-efficient
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   in the future.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.540]   But if you don't have the spare cash, what do you do?
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:59.780]   It's always been crazy for me to think, "Let's withdraw from our long-term savings."
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:03.540]   If you look at our wealth front balance for the last, I don't know, 5 years, it has not
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   been touched.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.580]   We don't withdraw from it ever.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:10.760]   It's our long-term retirement plan.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.700]   But now I'm like, "Psychologically, I'm talking about pulling money out of it so that I can
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.500]   take income somewhere else and put it somewhere else."
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:26.260]   Which in turn might mean investing my savings into the business, and then the business contributing
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.900]   to a retirement plan.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:32.260]   It's a little complicated and we're working with our accountant to make sure we don't
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.140]   mess it all up.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:39.380]   But it's just something that we're considering right now in that interim stage.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.340]   Once you go full, quit your job, financial independence, you tap into your savings all
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.380]   the time.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:52.220]   But now that I'm living this "Coast Five" thing, which is so funny to say, having misunderstood
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:55.900]   what it even meant as early as this morning, it's like, "Well, I don't want to touch my
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.620]   savings anymore."
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.620]   Even though I had that attitude, now I have a name to define why I'm not touching that
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.620]   savings.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.060]   And then almost immediately, I'm like, "No, no, no.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.580]   I'm going to touch it, but I'm going to replenish it through another door."
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.580]   I love that.
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.580]   So you're right.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:15.180]   You are, in essence, you're netting to zero in the sense that you would be pulling money
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:21.100]   out of your taxable brokerage account to cover your life expenses, but also contributing
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:26.260]   to retirement accounts, whatever they may be, whether it's this crazy cash balance thingamajig
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.980]   or 401k, etc.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:34.060]   But in essence, what you're doing then is getting the tax benefit from those contributions.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:42.560]   Yeah, it's like I'm basically shifting my after-tax, subject-to-tax-in-the-future investments
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:50.040]   to tax-advantaged investment accounts, which will reduce my income and give me more growth
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.040]   in the future.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.060]   So it actually is not a zero sum.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:00.580]   It's actually a net positive sum other than the short-term capital gains hits of selling
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:05.220]   my portfolio, which fortunately, because we've been keeping this money and wealth front for
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.760]   a while, we built up a ton of tax loss harvesting.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:15.020]   So I think I can actually mitigate most of the capital gains with built-up capital losses.
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   So yeah, it'll be a net positive.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.320]   And for anyone listening, I think, "Look, you might not be a business owner.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.480]   You might not be in a situation in any way similar to Brad or mine.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.840]   But if you work at a company, and you're not maxing out your 401(k) because maybe you just
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.200]   had two children and you decided to quit one of your jobs, and you're in a situation where
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:41.800]   cash is tight, but you do have savings in a taxable account, just a standard brokerage
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.060]   account, I'm not going to talk about what you should do.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:50.620]   I'm not going to give personalized financial advice, but definitely worth considering using
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.900]   some of your long-term savings to live on so that you can put some of your income into
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.700]   a more tax-efficient vehicle for long-term savings.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.520]   And it's important just for people to be cognizant of just this concept.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.460]   So yeah, it's very cool that you're doing this in real life.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:10.260]   And welcome to the Coast 5 world.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:15.480]   So one thing we haven't touched on, now that we've evolved our thinking on financial independence
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:21.380]   over the course of, for you, probably a decade, for me, probably a handful of years, I'm curious
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.060]   to hear some of the changes you've made.
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:33.540]   I think we both kind of went from more deprivation, less spending, to training ourselves to spend.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.380]   So I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about how did you learn this skill of
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.580]   spending and what have you been using it for?
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:43.300]   Yeah, the skill of spending is such a great way to put it and yeah, Mr. Money Mustache
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:48.500]   had come up with this earlier in the year as a phrase that really just appeals to me.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:54.860]   I think a skill of spending on the front side of FII is largely, okay, you do have to be
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:58.260]   more optimized, especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck or getting into debt
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   every month.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.140]   Okay, you have to cut, you have to be a little more efficient.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:06.380]   And that doesn't mean deprivation necessarily, but it means being smarter with your money.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:10.740]   But yeah, Chris, you and I are now at points where I think we've evolved the other side
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:19.220]   of the skill of spending is learning how to spend for life benefit, for memory dividends,
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:25.060]   for just enjoyment and for connection, for what we talked about last time, something
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:29.580]   that you're working on is trying to buy back your time in a lot of senses, right?
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:34.980]   Like there's lots of ways to spend and to spend well that can really help your life.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.420]   So yeah, I mean, I am really thinking about this in a lot of ways.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.500]   There's certainly spending to get time back just in little ways.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.580]   Even something like that is very obvious to most people, getting a cleaning service at
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:55.900]   our house, which we never did forever, spending more on food now than we ever have because
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:02.380]   we just spend a lot of time cooking and cleaning and it doesn't really make that much sense
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.380]   anymore.
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.260]   I think we're at a point in our lives where, okay, the ease, especially with having two
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:13.940]   daughters now in middle and high school, and we're driving them all over the place and
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:19.340]   to spend an hour cooking and 20 or 30 minutes cleaning up, it just, it doesn't make any
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.980]   sense for a couple of dollars.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.020]   So clearly spending more money there.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:26.780]   I mean, Chris, the biggest thing is like experiences.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:32.580]   I think this is something that I've been honestly like really proud of myself this year.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:38.620]   And this also comes back to like the memory dividends and Die With Zero and Bill Perkins.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.360]   I love music.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.220]   And this is like a part of my life that has really not been an important part of my life
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.060]   for the last 10 years because I've let it kind of fall by the wayside.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:58.260]   And I think in a lot of senses, like since my daughters were born, like I lost myself.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.100]   Might be hyperbolic, but I lost myself in a lot of like the things that I love doing.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:07.500]   I used to love watching like the English Premier League on Saturdays and going to concerts
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:13.300]   and doing just like a lot of fun stuff that I just had let, like I said, slip away.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:19.140]   And this year I challenged myself to really make moves on this and see what I can do.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:27.420]   And I actually planned like an impromptu last minute solo trip to New York City to see Bono
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.620]   from U2.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:36.180]   So he was doing this like really small concert at the Beacon Theatre that was partially a
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.180]   book tour.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:42.700]   So it was like half one-man show, half book tour/concert.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.580]   It was very, very interesting.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:50.940]   But I bought tickets on StubHub, bought flights, got a hotel, and it was like the week before.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.260]   And I just, I'm like, this is the coolest thing ever.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.800]   I'm going to take a trip to New York.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.420]   And it was, I mean, Chris, it was really awesome.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:04.060]   And that is something I never would have done in my entire life before reorienting this,
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.700]   before reorienting this, this skill of spending.
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.700]   And how did you do that reorientation?
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.300]   Because I think I'm not, I'm not quite there yet.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.060]   What do you think changed that made it possible now when it wouldn't have been possible in
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.060]   the past?
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:23.100]   It is understanding that time is finite.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:30.540]   And maybe that's that I'm 44 years old and not getting any younger and my kids are growing
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.780]   up.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:38.380]   And like I said, I might have, you know, lost some part of myself over the last 10 years
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:43.340]   where I haven't focused on, on things that bring joy.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:48.260]   And I just really want to do that.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.340]   There was no moment.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:54.260]   It was just understanding that you got to do it.
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.420]   You got to live life.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.140]   You can't be worried about saving money all the time.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:04.040]   And even just little challenges, Chris, like as silly as this sounds, like the Richmond
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.460]   airport is like, it's not very expensive long-term parking or even like the short-term parking.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.300]   But I was like on this trip to New York city, I'm like, what would, what would doing this
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.500]   trip like a rich person look like?
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.900]   And it was almost like a Ramit Sethi kind of thing.
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.280]   And it was not parking in economy parking.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.360]   It was parking in the daily lot that was right there.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.540]   And I could just walk over to the airport.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.860]   It was like, and Chris, this cost me like nine extra dollars because I was, it was 24,
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:31.860]   24 hour trip.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:37.380]   So this is not that big of a deal, but, and it might've even been less than that, frankly,
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.700]   but it just felt great.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.620]   It was just, it was really cool.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:45.020]   And it was like, okay, how can you find these little things that actually make a difference?
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:51.500]   And going back to the food, it was like, we get these amazing, hold on, let me say that
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.500]   again.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:56.140]   And going back to the food, like we're now getting these amazing meals brought into the
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:01.620]   house and it's like, it's just a couple of dollars more, but it's just reorienting to
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.940]   what's the value here.
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:08.380]   So it's like this valuist play is like this term valuist is how I've always, I've talked
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:15.940]   about this on the podcast for so many years, but I never really embodied it in, in actuality.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.820]   I think I did to some degree, but I didn't get there.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:23.300]   And now it's just, all right, look, like I said, and I know it sounds a little morbid,
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:28.980]   but I, but I think it's important is understanding the finite nature of your life, right?
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.500]   And like the finite nature of seasons of your life.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:38.540]   You know, I, I took a trip to see Taylor Swift to in Pittsburgh with my older daughter and
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:44.660]   we bought very, very expensive tickets on, on secondary and man, Chris, we had the time
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.660]   of our lives.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:50.860]   And like that we'll, we'll be talking about that 30 years from now, it was amazing.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.060]   And I don't regret any single one of those dollars I spent on that trip.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.620]   It was astonishing.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:03.340]   And I think it's, I I'm just, I'm really fortunate to be in this position, but I'm really proud
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.380]   of myself that, that I've made these changes in that shorter period of time.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:14.620]   I mean, a lot of the language you're using, memory dividends, seasons of life were, were
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:18.500]   languages from Bill Perkins' book, Die With Zero.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:25.740]   I know, you know, I had him on for, I want to say episode 91, but I can't quite remember
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:28.300]   the number.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.620]   Did that have a big impact on you?
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.620]   It was episode 91.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.620]   That book had a massive impact on me.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.620]   It really did.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.140]   And it was just the, the conceptual framework.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.740]   And I mean, Chris, I knew all this stuff, right?
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:46.340]   Like sometimes it just crystallizes and hits in a moment when it matters.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:51.300]   And I think that's, what's also interesting about taking in a lot of different content.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:54.940]   Like I probably listen to way more podcasts and read more books than I, than I probably
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:55.940]   should frankly.
[00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.620]   But like, but sometimes you just, you hit on something like this, where it is just a
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.700]   life-changing thing.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.380]   And I, and I don't know what it was, but, but again, like I'm even doing like little
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.380]   things now.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:14.660]   Like I went to a yoga and meditation retreat last month that like, that's something I never
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   would have done.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:24.860]   I never would have had the guts to like, just go off for two days by myself and just be.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.860]   And it was awesome.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.220]   It was just really fantastic.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.700]   I'm like, again, just trying to build these things into life.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:38.140]   Like I'm part of a mastermind group where it's about 24, 25 of those guys.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:43.180]   And now we're trying to do more in-person events and like, Chris, I always had an excuse.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.780]   I always had, it was always like, oh, it's too far.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.140]   Oh, I need to be home for the weekend with my wife and my daughters.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.780]   Like it's selfish to leave.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.460]   Like that's how, this is the script that I always had running in my head.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.340]   Like it's selfish to leave, but you know, it's really important to take care of yourself
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.060]   too and to find joy in little ways.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:07.660]   And like, we had this day of fun at one of my buddy's house, 12 of us kind of converged
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.900]   on his house and in New Jersey.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.700]   And we had like eight hours of playing like this, like Olympics of games.
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.700]   And it was just, cause it was the most fun I've had in years.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:22.580]   And like one of the guys cooked this amazing like Michelin star-esque dinner.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.380]   It was just like one of those days I'll remember forever.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:31.300]   And like, I know I could tell you for certain a year ago, I would have said no to that weekend.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.300]   I would have just said out of hand, no.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.700]   And so again, this reorientation.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.880]   So I think, yeah, I mean, a lot of things have changed in my life and I think they've
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.180]   changed for the better.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.140]   I don't think it's selfish to take care of yourself.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:47.660]   I think it's selfish if you don't encourage your partner to also do the same.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.660]   So I'm sure you found that balance as well.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.140]   And I think that's the important thing.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.820]   I had a similar moment, which was more serendipitous in that it wasn't something I would have said
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.300]   no to.
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:03.180]   But we had this moment where we invited some friends up to a house we were staying at in
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.780]   Napa, not ours.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.220]   And there was a volleyball court.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:11.140]   And for like two hours, we were all just playing outdoor volleyball, probably getting sunburned.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:16.260]   But we're blasting some good 80s rock.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.460]   And I just had this moment where I was like, "Wow, this is...
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.020]   I want more moments like this."
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.100]   And the downside is that with kids and stuff, you have to really plan them.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.660]   You can't just expect to text five friends and be like, "Hey, do you want to go do this
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.260]   thing an hour away right now?"
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.260]   No.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.260]   It's just...
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.160]   It's not practical anymore.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.740]   Maybe when I get a little older and my peers and friends or kids are a little older and
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.620]   easier to travel with, maybe it'll get a little better.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:45.340]   But you have to plan ahead and you have to commit earlier.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.940]   And I think I'm still learning, but you've got a couple years on me and your kids do
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.940]   as well.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:53.260]   So I hope I get to that place where you are.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:58.460]   But I had the same impact when I talked to Bill Perkins and I made that episode.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.860]   And we actually planned a trip to London and Paris.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.460]   I talked about it in the episode and then we just booked it.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.800]   And we were like, "We just have to do it."
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.180]   And in a weird way, we stopped tracking our net worth after that episode.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.340]   We stopped caring about whether it went up.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.660]   And we started focusing on "Do we just have enough now?
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.860]   And when do we want to spend our money?
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.860]   Do we want to spend it later?
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.340]   Do we want to stop working?"
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.020]   And for us, now we've both found something we like doing.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.340]   So I don't know.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.980]   It changed a lot for me.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.140]   I encourage anyone to go pick it up and read it.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:35.820]   Or if you want a preview, the hour version, I interviewed him in episode 91, which we
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.080]   can link to in the show notes.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.660]   But yeah, that changed a lot for me.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:46.880]   And we started spending a little bit more on things that some have an ROI, some don't.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:54.980]   But I actually am surprised at how much we've been able to accomplish with the podcast,
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:59.840]   now that we have a little more free time, because we've spent a little bit of money
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.600]   on other things.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:08.120]   Whether that's someone to clean or someone to help with food, or that's hiring an assistant
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.040]   or an employee for your company.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.740]   These things that felt like they were big expenses we were nervous about.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.560]   But now that we have them, they've unlocked a little bit more creativity, a little bit
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.080]   more time.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.080]   And we've been good in our career at turning that into opportunity.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.120]   And so you'll never know unless you try.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.000]   That's some expenses, right?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.160]   A Taylor Swift concert is probably not one that's going to make you more money in the
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   long run.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.400]   But it's certainly one that's going to give you memories that far exceed that.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:45.280]   And whatever version of that exists when our daughters are a little older, I'm very excited
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   to do the same thing.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.040]   And it's important to prioritize it.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.360]   And I think just it being in your mind and like you said, going back and listening to
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:00.760]   that episode 91 of All The Hacks, that episode was more impactful to me than the book was,
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.960]   honestly, hearing him talk it through.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.240]   So yeah, I think that's a perfect starting point for people.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   And...
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.560]   Well, to go back to the Early Retirement Now blog, he gave a review of that book.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.560]   Yeah, that was part 60, right?
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:21.640]   And what was interesting was, he justifiably said, "A lot of these things aren't new."
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.760]   And I think the thing that Bill Perkins did was he took a bunch of concepts that we've
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.080]   all known.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.840]   We've all known that experiences are valuable.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   We all know that money diminishes or health diminishes.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.660]   But if you could package it in a good way, ultimately, a lot of things are just storytelling.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:46.120]   And I will say that when it comes to telling a story about money, most people aren't that
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   great at it.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.320]   It's something that a lot of people get bored with, aren't interested in, and Bill Perkins
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:57.280]   weaves a story around it that I think just comes alive when you hear him talk more than
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.840]   when you read the book, though.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.080]   You'll hear a reminder if you go listen to it.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.520]   And I'll give it to you here.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.140]   It is not an episode to listen to with young children in the room.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:13.960]   He has a very colorful vocabulary.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   He does indeed.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:22.800]   And yeah, I mean, even like you said, talking about health and longevity and vitality, spending
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.080]   money on that is important.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.600]   I think we both have become a little more cognizant of that.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:34.480]   I know this year I hired a personal trainer who I met through Twitter, actually, which
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.560]   was kind of wild.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:42.840]   But that again is something I can guarantee you two years ago, there was no chance that
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.600]   I would have done that, 0% chance.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.280]   And it has been the best money I've ever spent on my health in my entire life.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:56.320]   I was watching this video that a past guest of mine, Nisar Yasin, Nas Daily made.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.920]   And he hired a personal trainer in India from this company called Fitter.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   And I haven't done it yet.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.480]   I haven't pulled the trigger on this service yet.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.200]   But I was thinking about it and I want your perspective.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.420]   So your personal trainer is remote, right?
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:12.560]   They're not located where you are.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560]   You don't see them in person.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.180]   They don't come to the gym with you.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.680]   Is there a reason that they need to be in the US?
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.040]   Because if you look at the cost of living around the world, if someone could motivate
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.000]   you just as well, but in India, they can certainly live on less.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   And I was blown away.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.360]   And by the way, I have no connection to this company.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.280]   So I don't want to endorse it at all.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:39.440]   But I was looking at it and the personal training sessions were like $5 a session.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.440]   And you could do it in 5 days a week, monthly for like $100 a month or something in that
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.440]   ballpark.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.900]   I don't want to quote the prices because I'm not an expert here.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.240]   But I was just surprised.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.920]   And then it just got me thinking there are some services and practices that are really
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.220]   tied into our system, right?
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.140]   Hiring a tax accountant, you want someone who's really familiar with the rules and the
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.140]   regulations here.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:07.620]   But I was like, "Ah, personal trainer, someone to just throw on a tripod and motivate me
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.680]   to work out and whatnot, live video sessions every time.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.860]   Why couldn't that person be overseas?"
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:21.900]   So I want to hear your perspective on whether you think that you could get a similar output
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900]   from that.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.780]   And if so, how does that change your thinking?
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.320]   Yeah, that is really interesting.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.820]   I definitely think that you could hire someone from anywhere in the world.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:38.700]   So it depends what you're looking for, right?
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:46.020]   So how you described it, if you're looking for somebody to be there with you or just
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:51.460]   create a video or whatever, 5 days a week, motivation, a little accountability, absolutely.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.700]   It makes no difference where they are.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:59.780]   Yeah, my guy, Dean Turner is my personal trainer.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.900]   And he's fantastic.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.380]   Deanturnertraining.com is where he's located.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:10.460]   But, you know, he's in Philadelphia, which is not that far from me, but I'm never going
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.500]   to meet him in person in all likelihood.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.420]   So yeah, he could be in India, he could be in Australia, it would make no difference
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.420]   whatsoever.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:23.140]   I am paying for his expertise though, not for the motivation.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:31.660]   So yeah, clearly, if I was paying for motivation, I would move to that service you just mentioned.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.660]   That sounds like a slam dunk.
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.980]   I mean, that actually sounds amazing.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.020]   I suspect a lot of people would benefit from them.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.260]   You could even pair the two, right?
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:41.420]   You could probably find Dean and be like, "Help me come up with the curriculum."
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.140]   And then say, "Great.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.380]   Now someone else..."
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:51.100]   This is my big challenge with a lot of services is that you want to pay for experience and
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.300]   execution.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.540]   And a lot of times, you hire the person...
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:10:00.500]   And you can't get good experience without paying for it.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.160]   People charge a lot more for their time when they have experience.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.700]   But then it doesn't make sense to pay for the execution also.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.620]   And I think about this with financial planning, right?
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:13.660]   Like a human financial planner will give you a better financial plan that connects your
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.740]   emotions and stuff.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   And I'm not against people paying a fixed price for that.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.380]   I think that's really valuable.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:25.020]   It's just if you then on top of that tack on an ongoing 1% of your assets forever fee
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.460]   to manage the investments, that's where I'm like, "Oh, I don't know."
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.120]   So I wonder if there's a hybrid approach here where I think it's totally fine to pay financial
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:39.740]   planning fixed fee annually, and then a much smaller fee for investments.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:46.720]   Is there a Dean Turner + fitter super combo where you get daily motivation and workout
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.820]   regimens following the curriculum of someone who has a lot more experience and personalization?
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.660]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:59.220]   So this now is turning into a business lesson for Dean, I think.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:06.260]   So because, yeah, I wonder if he could scale his business more that way, if he used his
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:13.260]   expertise to create the programming, but then he found these people wherever they may be,
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.380]   and certainly a lower cost area.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:22.780]   And he could then potentially outsource part of the day-to-day with knowledgeable people
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:29.620]   who are well-versed in his methodology.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.020]   That would actually be really interesting.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:35.700]   Dean, if you're listening, at a minimum, if you go down this path, I'd love to give it
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.700]   a try.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:37.700]   That would be really cool.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.580]   I bet he'd be super interested in that.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:46.420]   So yeah, to be continued on that, but yeah, I think accountability is important.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.300]   I think that's why people like group exercise classes also, right?
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:55.700]   Everybody else is waiting for them, whether it's CrossFit or yoga or whatever it may be,
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.220]   Orange Theory Fitness, all these things.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:02.360]   When you have people waiting for you and, oh, they text you when you're not there, why?
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.660]   It's so easy to fall out of an exercise routine.
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:11.300]   And I think, to me, accountability and motivation are really, really important.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.220]   That's why I thought this was so interesting, because I was like, you know what, I would
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:19.300]   work out to avoid losing $5.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.100]   I might have gotten comfortable in my life spending money, but I have not gotten comfortable
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.380]   losing money.
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:32.660]   It seems so much harder to be comfortable just giving up money, even though you probably,
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.180]   in some cases, should.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:38.180]   So in this particular case, I'm like, it would almost be worth it just to say, "I'm going
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:43.260]   to work out 3 days a week from 8 to 8.30 and I'm going to book it with a person, just any
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.260]   person."
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:45.260]   It could even be non-existent.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:50.180]   I'm like, I'm going to pay this money and my wife gets to throw it, light it on fire
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.500]   if I don't work out.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:57.720]   But even better if you have someone that can sit there and motivate you along the way.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.060]   Anything else you've been doing in health that's worth covering?
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:05.700]   I know the last time you were on, you said 2023 is going to be your year to get healthy.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.500]   It's definitely, yeah, my bold move was healthiest year ever.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:19.140]   So yeah, I mean, a lot of it has, I talked last time, last episode about DNS that I have
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:27.460]   been doing to kind of maybe deal with some nagging shoulder and hip issues that I had.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.980]   And that's helped dramatically.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:35.220]   I think I've just been much more open again to spending money on massage.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.980]   I go, I get a massage in that cupping thing.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:42.060]   I don't know if you've ever seen that on swimmers at the Olympics.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.100]   So I do that once a month.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:50.420]   I found something in a Tony Robbins book that he was talking about this thing called fascial
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:57.340]   counter strain, and it's like a massage slash fascial release, which I really, really enjoy.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:03.940]   It winds up, what's so funny is the guy who owns the business here in Richmond is in the
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.260]   financial independence world.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:08.940]   He's like, "Are you by any chance Brad from choose a vibe?"
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:09.940]   It was hilarious.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.620]   So yeah, I mean, I've been doing that.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:15.400]   I bought an aura ring to track my sleep.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.420]   So I've been really focusing and trying to dial in in my sleep a lot.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:28.740]   I think I mentioned to you that I bought a hot tub and I just bought a cold plunge, but
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.180]   it was actually not one of those super duper expensive ones.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:37.140]   One of our listeners, a guy named Mitch, reached out to me and told me about this thing called
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   the ice pod.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.980]   Oh, I thought you were going to go down the path of the ice barrel, but the ice pod.
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:42.980]   No, no, no.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.200]   It is something you can buy.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.740]   So it's by the pod company.
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:49.940]   It looks like podcompany.com.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:50.940]   This thing's like 150 bucks.
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:53.660]   I mean, honestly, Chris, it's nothing special.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:56.700]   It's just kind of like an insulated little...
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:02.100]   If you've ever seen one of those like blow up hot tubs that cost like 500 bucks.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:07.220]   This is something similar for cold plunge, but the last handful of nights, we just got
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.380]   it up and running.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.500]   My two daughters and I have gone out after dinner.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.740]   It's getting dark now because it's getting later in the year.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:21.820]   So darkness, we go out, go in the hot tub, go in the cold plunge, back in the hot tub.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:25.740]   And it's just like this cool little experience together.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.500]   And I mean, this cold plunge thing, like I said, it was like 150 bucks.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.780]   It was fantastic.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:35.060]   So even if we don't use it much beyond the next month or two, it would be well worth
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.060]   it.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.580]   So, yeah, just all these little things that I'm just trying to add to my life.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:43.980]   And some of the stuff is really cool, like these experiences that I'm having now with
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:44.980]   my family.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:45.980]   I love it.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.680]   One of ours will be a sauna, which is days from now, we're getting added on, which will
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.660]   finally, I think, get our cold plunge more usage.
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.580]   For as much as I enjoy hot tubs, I enjoy saunas a lot more.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.900]   Is it an infrared sauna or a barrel sauna?
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.900]   It is neither.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.860]   It is a full kind of finish.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.020]   I've been working with this company that I'm not ready to share.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:14.860]   But when I am, they're building like...
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:21.740]   They might be like the best sauna makers in the U.S., at least making it accessible.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:25.180]   So it's kind of a much more finished sauna experience.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.980]   I went really deep down the rabbit hole of saunas.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.700]   (laughs) Surprise, surprise.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:35.860]   And there's this Trumpkin guide to saunas, which is like this crazy guide.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:41.380]   And barrel saunas have plenty of critique.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.420]   And so I was on the fence about it.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.300]   And I actually met someone who's like, "No, no, no.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:48.900]   I'm building this company and we're going to make the best saunas.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:52.660]   And we're going to do it in a way that is modular and easy for people to order and set
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.940]   up at their home and build something really nice."
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.500]   And yeah, I'm very excited.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:05.740]   But this is like a proper finish sauna style experience that gets hot.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:10.700]   And so, I don't know, Amy and I are very excited to add this to our routine.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.860]   And ideally, it'll be like, put the girls to bed and have a little time together in
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:19.900]   the sauna, dip out to the cold plunge, finish off in the sauna and sleep better.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.900]   Heck, yeah.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.900]   I love it.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.900]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.900]   All right.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.900]   To be continued on that one, for sure.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.100]   To be continued.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:32.940]   Maybe the fourth edition of Brad and Chris record a podcast together.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:37.540]   If you make it out to the West Coast, we can see if the audio equipment handles the heat.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.540]   Sounds good.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:42.260]   Might not be a video version, but you know...
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.260]   2024 goals.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:44.260]   I like it.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.540]   This has been great.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.140]   The emails I got after the last time we did it, I think I got 20 emails that were just
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.780]   like subject more Brad.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.100]   So for the 20 people who wrote in asking for more Brad, here you are.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.940]   Hopefully, there was at least a more Chris email in your inbox too.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:00.940]   I'll just pretend there was.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:01.940]   Yeah, no.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.940]   You know we got flooded with them.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.340]   I copied you on all the responses, so you know they came in.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.340]   Awesome.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.660]   Well, this has been great.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:10.300]   I am excited for your healthiest year ever.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:14.100]   I hope you finish it out strong and we'll chat soon.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.100]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.100]   Thank you, my friend.
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.300]   As always, it's good to chat with you and yeah, until next time.
