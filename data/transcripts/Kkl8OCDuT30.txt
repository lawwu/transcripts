[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   "Why do you think that personal finance and investing
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   "are just so hard for so many people?"
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.040]   - It is a very complex topic,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.720]   and it is filled with mountains of data,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.400]   but more important, mountains of emotions.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.560]   And I think that everybody
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.640]   has their own unique experience with money.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.540]   We grow up in different types of environments.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.040]   We grow with different types of parents
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.160]   and different types of role models to look to.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.840]   And as a big part of that, historically,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.640]   money, personal finance, and investing,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.160]   they haven't been subjects that have ever
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.600]   been taught in school.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.900]   A lot of schools have basically said,
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.380]   "You're gonna learn this from your parents,
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.920]   "and you're gonna learn this from outside of the classroom."
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.000]   So because of that,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.680]   and because it's such an important topic
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.160]   that is emotionally charged,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.120]   I think it is a very easy topic
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.120]   to have a lot of different opinions on.
