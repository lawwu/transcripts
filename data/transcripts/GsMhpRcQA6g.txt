[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.360]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.800]   My name is Teresa, and I work as a journalist and editor
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.960]   for a niche industry publication in the Midwest.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.600]   Before the pandemic, I would spend up to two hours
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.660]   of my workday on Twitter, thinking
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.360]   it helped me stay on top of the news in my industry
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.920]   and helped me generate story ideas.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.260]   But in reality, it was mostly to pass the time
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.240]   while I was sitting at a desk from 8 to 5.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.920]   After reading your books and listening to your podcasts,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.560]   I decided to use my work from home opportunity
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.920]   to develop new habits.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.880]   So I decided to quit Twitter.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   Now I only use Facebook to keep informed of my daughter's
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.640]   school announcements and my favorite local businesses
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   I choose to support.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.360]   The problem is, now that I'm back to the office,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720]   I feel like I'm behind my colleagues who are still
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.840]   on Twitter and getting story ideas from the chatter
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.440]   among those of us in our industry.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.520]   My question is, how do I overcome the fear of missing out
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.440]   as a journalist and still stay up to date on news
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.360]   in my industry without using Twitter and social media?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   Thanks, Cal, and I really appreciate your podcast
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.640]   and all of your advice.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.840]   Well, I appreciate this question.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   I actually had this debate with Ezra Klein in one
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.680]   of the appearances I did on his show.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.120]   I remember arguing with him about the necessity of him
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.440]   when he was the editor of Vox actually being on Twitter
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.880]   or not to keep up with the news.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.240]   And it was a spirited debate, which
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   is to say, if you're actually in a job where you want to keep up
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   with what's going on, it's not an obvious issue.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.840]   I would say a couple of things here.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920]   First of all, I do applaud you for quitting Twitter.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.120]   I think Twitter is basically like a reverse anxiety drug.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.320]   So instead of taking Paxil to feel like you have less anxiety,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.800]   you're taking anti-Paxil to make your anxiety really go up.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.480]   It really is terrible for mental health,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.520]   especially in our current climate.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.480]   So let's start with that as probably being good
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.160]   and see if we can figure out how to go forward without it.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.080]   I also want to mention, however, as an aside,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.160]   this observation you had that pre-pandemic you were really
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.720]   using Twitter to fill the time.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.280]   It's a really important observation.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.640]   And it's why I really recommend time block planning,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120]   especially if you're going to be working in an office where
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.440]   you are making a plan for what you want to do with your time.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   What's the best things to do with your time?
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.400]   If you're time block planning, you're not going to kill time.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   You either are going to find more or additional productive
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.160]   things to do, or you're going to be
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.400]   able to put large intentional breaks into your day.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.960]   And you could use these breaks to make progress
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.200]   on other projects or to learn about other things.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   We've talked about this before.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.440]   You can do it in a way that your employer won't be upset.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.760]   So I really don't like the idea of killing time informally.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.000]   Schedule what you want to do.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.840]   Make the most out of the time when you don't
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.640]   want to be working.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   Time block planning helps you do it.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.200]   All right, let's get back to trying to stay up on the news.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.400]   I have to imagine in whatever industry it is that you cover,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.840]   there is a way to stay up on what matters in the news
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   without having to just watch the ill thought
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.360]   through small tweet character count messages going by
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.080]   in that feed.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.680]   There's just so much that's toxic that happens on Twitter.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.000]   It just hits this way of interacting
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.360]   that presses all the buttons.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.160]   Just it's so quick to be annoyed or upset or mean
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.040]   and pseudo-anonymous.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.460]   I mean, the whole thing is a mess.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.640]   There has to be a way.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.160]   There has to be a way that you can stay up on news
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.440]   without having to just be there on Twitter.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.160]   So maybe there's email newsletters.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160]   There's podcasts.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.040]   There's websites.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.960]   There's honest-to-God physical newspapers.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   Depending what the medium is, find other ways
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.080]   that you can ritualize to expose yourself to what's
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   going on in that world.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.360]   Hold the line if you can against getting back on Twitter.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.320]   I mean, honestly, if I was a reporter--
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.720]   this is what I suggested to Ezra--
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   I would rather hire someone whose job it
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.400]   was three times a day to go into a Twitter account we set up
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.080]   for them with a clear list of the type of things
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.840]   I care about, what qualifies as breaking news
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.720]   I need to know about.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.400]   And they can call me if they see something.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.880]   Because you know what?
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.360]   They're going to find something once a month.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.720]   And once a month is not worth spending three hours a day
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.400]   lost in that morass of anxiety-producing nonsense.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.160]   So find a way not to be on Twitter,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.960]   especially if you know that you're prone to falling down
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   that rabbit hole, especially if you know you're
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.080]   prone to start using that as just anxiety-producing,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.840]   time-killing.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.440]   There's other ways to stay up to date
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   on the world with a little bit of effort.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.760]   I think you can find it.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.560]   Get it?
