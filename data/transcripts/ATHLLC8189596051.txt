[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.480]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.280]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.480]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you here.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   Okay.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.880]   So today I'm talking to Sunil Gupta.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.320]   He's the bestselling author of Backable, a really amazing book about the
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.520]   surprising truth behind what makes people take a chance on you.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.440]   He is also the founding CEO of the nutrition coaching app Rise, which was
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.920]   named App of the Year by Apple before selling to One Medical.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.640]   He later ran for U.S.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.840]   Congress, served on the faculty at Harvard, and is currently an emissary for
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.720]   gross national happiness between the United States and the kingdom of Bhutan.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.840]   I'm not even sure what that means, but it sounds pretty cool.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.800]   And in this conversation, we'll dig into his background and the research
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.480]   that uncovered seven surprising changes that course corrected his life and
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.440]   his career by letting him go from being embarrassed to speak inside team
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.600]   meetings to confidently pitching ideas inside the offices of people
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.440]   like Michelle Obama and Tim Cook.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.200]   We'll learn what it takes to have a seemingly mysterious superpower that
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.560]   lies at the intersection of creativity and persuasion, something
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.200]   he calls becoming backable.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.600]   Why is this important?
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.880]   Because we all have a brilliant idea tucked away somewhere.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.400]   Yet most of us are afraid to share it and have it be dismissed.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.640]   So I hope you enjoy this conversation with Sunil Gupta.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.600]   Sunil, thank you for being here.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   Chris, it's great to be here.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   Thanks so much for having me.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, I want to start with a fun story.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.400]   I don't know if I've ever shared this with you, but back in 2009, I also had
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.080]   my own face of failure story.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.200]   And I got laid off and I started a conference called Laid Off Camp.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.760]   So I was doing everything I could to promote this conference.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.360]   I was just hoping that someone would write about it.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.720]   People would learn about it.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.920]   And I kept striking out.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.280]   And so one day I got this email from a reporter who asked if I
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.520]   could participate in a story.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   And I was so excited.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.080]   After the interview, I called a friend of mine who knew everyone in tech.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.840]   And I said, "Hey, this reporter from TechCrunch reached out to me.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.080]   I did this story.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.040]   I'm so excited."
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.240]   And he was like, "Who was it?"
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.600]   I talked to him and he goes, "Yeah, that person doesn't work at TechCrunch."
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.520]   I was like, "What do you mean?"
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.160]   We searched online.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.920]   There wasn't ever a story that had been written by this person.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.040]   And we concluded that I got totally punked.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.600]   So my excitement was like, turned south.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.840]   And the next morning, a story actually came out on TechCrunch, written by Lena
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.200]   Rao, who also happens to be your wife.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.240]   So that's my connection to your family from way back and my story
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.000]   of kind of recovering from failure.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   This interview has already started out at a very, very meta level.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.360]   It's unbelievable.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.840]   Yes.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.640]   I mean, I love that story.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.160]   And I think my failure story is that I was out there pitching my company Rise.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.680]   I was getting rejected by every investor that ever took a meeting with me.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.960]   And, you know, I'd started a couple of companies before that, too,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.200]   that didn't do all that well.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.760]   And then I joined Groupon, which had a little bit of a moment and
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.280]   then sort of crashed, as we know.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.120]   It lost 80% of its market value within a few months.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.360]   And so I get a phone call one day from a conference organizer.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   And she's like, "Hey, would you like to be a keynote speaker at this conference?"
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.640]   And I said, "That sounds wonderful.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.760]   What's the name of the conference?"
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.680]   And she says, "FailCon," which stands for failure conference.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.080]   And so I'm literally asked to be a keynote speaker for a conference on
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.880]   failure, and I do it, and I didn't realize that there was a reporter from
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.400]   the New York Times in the audience.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:27.080]   And fast forward to this full-length article on failure with my face as
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.920]   the cover of this article, and I don't know what happened with that TechCrunch
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.640]   article that Lena wrote, but for this, I mean, Chris, it was crazy how viral it went.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.920]   And this was like early 2014.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   And I think failure, like the idea of failure was just starting
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.880]   to come into the zeitgeist.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.120]   We were talking about it a lot more, especially in places like Silicon Valley.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.560]   And so there was a moment where literally you could have Googled the
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.440]   word "failure" and my face would have been one of your very top search results.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.640]   I have to imagine that was, that's not like the moment you want.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.360]   Like if you could dictate what your search results are,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.960]   that's probably not the ideal one.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.600]   How did that evolve to a place where you're now, you ran for Congress, you
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.400]   wrote a book about becoming backable?
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.080]   You know, a good friend of mine gave me a piece of advice and I'll never forget it.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   And this is going to sound very sort of Buddhism focused, but, you know, the
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.440]   parable that he shared with me is that when you feel pain in life, you feel
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   embarrassment, there are two arrows that are fired.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.400]   One is the arrow that punctures your skin, right?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.840]   It's the, it's the arrow that actually causes you the pain.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.520]   And, and there's not much you can really do about that arrow.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.560]   But the second arrow is, is, is the meaning that you ascribe to that pain, right?
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.760]   What do you actually do with it?
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   And for me, you know, I was, I was embarrassed by, by all this and I, and
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.520]   yeah, I thought to myself, gosh, I've spent all this time trying to establish
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.400]   myself as this sort of face of success.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.000]   And now every time somebody Googles my name, failure, a list of my failures
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.720]   is going to be the first thing they see.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.880]   But you know, what I decided to do with it as I started reaching out to all of
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   these people who I admired from celebrity chefs to Oscar winning filmmakers to
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.240]   leaders of big iconic companies.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.240]   And I would, I would basically write an email, Hey, as you can see from this
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.680]   link, from this article, I have no idea what I'm doing, but would you be willing
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.400]   to grab some time with me?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.800]   Would you be willing to give me some advice?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.440]   And I was just astonished by how many people said, yes, I will, I will spend
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.240]   some time with you.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.280]   And I was also astonished by, I think people's willingness to talk about their
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.080]   failure, especially in these private conversations, because when you look at
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.160]   their bio, you look at their LinkedIn, you're not, you're not seeing that side
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.760]   of the story.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.040]   You're not seeing all the misses.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.400]   You're just seeing all the wins.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.800]   And so a couple of things really occurred to me during that conversation.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.520]   Number one, we don't rewind the clock enough and see how failure wasn't
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.920]   necessarily the opposite of success, but failure was a pathway to success for most
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.160]   of the people that we find to be successful.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.040]   But the second thing is that people who change things, they didn't just learn how
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.000]   to cultivate a new idea.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.320]   They learned how to sell a new idea.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.960]   They learned how to make themselves backable.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.040]   And that was a key thing that continued to come up over and over again, because
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.680]   you can have a brilliant idea and you can still be dismissed, right?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.320]   That happens all of the time.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.880]   And sometimes the paradox, the trick of it is that sometimes the more unique your
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.000]   idea, the less obvious it is, sometimes the harder it is to get people to buy in.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.120]   And so it puts us in a bit of a weird situation, especially if you are somebody
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.360]   who's trying to create change.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.600]   And that can be as an entrepreneur, that can be inside your own company, which is
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.320]   that oftentimes we are striving to do things that are different, right?
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.360]   I haven't talked to a single CEO of a company who isn't like, we want to be
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.280]   doing things differently.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.720]   We want to shake things up, but we rely on different.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   We need things to be different.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.720]   And yet different ideas are also the hardest to sell.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.360]   And so you have to, in some ways, again, not just learn how to come up with these
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.640]   kernels that are going to change things, but you also need to learn how to get
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.160]   people to buy into those things.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.680]   And you mentioned a couple examples of people with ideas, entrepreneurs, you and
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.320]   I have both been on both sides of that table as investors, as founders, but it
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.240]   came to me that this isn't just about learning how to get people to back your
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.920]   startup with dollars, that this could really have lessons outside of that,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.000]   which apply to anyone.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.280]   I completely agree.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.120]   You know, I mean, you know, you and I both are fathers now.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.720]   And I think about sort of what am I telling my kids based on my experience?
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.120]   What am I trying to share with them?
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.200]   And what's the outlook that I want them to have?
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.160]   And I have two daughters.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.200]   And oftentimes we say to our kids, you can do anything you want, right?
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   That's like the thing that a parent will sometimes say.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.000]   And I, and I've catch myself sometimes saying that, but I feel like I, knowing
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.720]   what I know now, I feel like I need to be more nuanced about it.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.840]   It's not, you can do anything you want.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.240]   It's, you can do anything you want, but remember that no one ever does it alone.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.360]   Right?
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.080]   No, no, no successful product, project, political movement, career trajectory
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.160]   that was successful ever happened through one person just saying, I'm going to go
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.720]   do that and doing it alone.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.800]   It was always the people along the way that invested in you, that hired you, that
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.040]   took a chance on you in some way, shape or form.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.520]   And yeah, that could be an investor for your startup, but it could be a hiring
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.720]   manager who says, you don't meet all the qualifications of this role, but I, but I
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.920]   like your energy and I'm going to take a chance on you.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.000]   It could even be friends and family, no matter what we're trying to do.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.600]   And in our communities and our careers and our companies, we always need to have
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.360]   those people taking a leap of faith on us.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.600]   And so how do you do that?
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.040]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   And if you think about people who just have jobs, they're not looking to get a
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.560]   new job.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.520]   Are there some examples of how you can use these kind of back ability traits
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.960]   to get things done at work?
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.080]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.920]   I mean, I know you had a Tim Ferriss on the show a few weeks ago, and one of the
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.880]   most important things that I think sort of surfaced in the book was, was what I
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.080]   call casting a central character, casting a central character.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.120]   And the way that this came up for me was when I was, when I was actually pitching
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.880]   my idea, though, I think that this is, this is something that can be, you know,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.360]   used inside companies as well.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.960]   But I was pitching Tim on my startup Rise, and what Rise did was one-on-one
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.840]   nutrition coaching.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.640]   And I had all of the sort of, I had the classic like Silicon Valley pitch deck,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:37.880]   right?
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.600]   It was like all the numbers, all the sort of trend lines, you know, I talked about
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.040]   the rising rates of obesity and hypertension and diabetes and, and how big
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.120]   this market was going to be.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.040]   And then literally during like Q&A, Tim and I started talking, and the story of
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.400]   my father came up.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.800]   And the story of my father is that when my dad was in his early 40s, he had, he
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.880]   had a triple bypass surgery, emergency.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.240]   He was rushed to the hospital.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.680]   He, he almost lost his life.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.720]   I mean, it was, it was, it was a really close call.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   And what I remembered most about the experience and what I was sharing with
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.160]   Tim was that when we went to go pick him up and, and brought him home, they had
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.840]   given us a folder of paperwork.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   And I remember sitting in the backseat of the car, I was nine years old, and I'm
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.040]   flipping through this paperwork.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.680]   And one of the pieces of paper was how to eat, right?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.160]   And then it had things like eat broccoli, eat Brussels sprouts.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.480]   And I remember thinking to myself, like, we don't, we don't eat broccoli.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.360]   We don't eat Brussels sprouts.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.600]   Like we're Indian, like we eat Indian food at home, right?
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.120]   That's not, just not part of our diet.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.960]   And I remember thinking to myself, like, I don't think this is really going to stick
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.920]   for my dad.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.360]   And it didn't.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.760]   Like he was, he was back in the hospital within 60 days.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:55.000]   And so it was when we went back to the hospital that they gave us the help of a
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.760]   nutritionist.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.120]   Insurance kicked in, helped pay for the cost.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.480]   And I believe that my dad is alive today, over 25 years later, because of the help
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   of that, of that nutritionist, because she was able to customize something that was
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.280]   able to make, you know, it really stick and work for our lifestyle, for who we are
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.920]   and how we ate.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.920]   And so I remember telling Tim that story.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.760]   And he looks at me and he's like, why wasn't that part of the pitch?
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.800]   Like, why was that?
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.960]   Why was that like a footnote in all of this?
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.720]   And what I realized is that oftentimes when we walk into a meeting and we're trying
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.320]   to persuade people, we come in with the numbers.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.880]   And that's especially true, I think, in places like, you know, Silicon Valley or in
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.280]   New York, when we can be incredibly numbers driven.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.120]   But sometimes we miss the story, the story of that one, that one, one person.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.600]   Right.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.440]   And what we found when we looked at the most successful pitches, both for
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.600]   startups or inside companies, what people tend to do is they tend to take us into
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   the, into the shoes of that one person that they're trying to serve.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.440]   Right.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.800]   And then they zoom out and talk about the millions of people who are sharing that
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.520]   one person's story.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.240]   So in the case of Arise, in case of my company, I would walk in and tell the
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.480]   story of my dad, right?
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   I would tell them, I would tell investors that story.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.240]   And then I would talk about the millions of people who are going through their own
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.680]   version of that same story.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.480]   Central character, casting one central character and marrying story with
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.960]   substance is, I think, one of the keys of a backable person.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.680]   Like stories bring us in, but substance keeps us there.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.440]   And so is that something that applies more throughout?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.640]   Do you start with the story?
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.400]   Do you have the story embedded throughout everything you're talking about?
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.000]   Is it more of the narrative?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.440]   How do you, how do you actually apply that?
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.480]   Yeah, I think you can try different.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.440]   I think you can try different ways and there's not a fixed formula as to
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.120]   sequence.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.680]   I don't think the story necessarily needs to come first.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.880]   I personally do.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.520]   I like the idea of walking into a room and saying like, let me, let me introduce
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.560]   you to this one person.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.000]   Right.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.200]   And let, let me bring you in in that way.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.920]   And then let's talk about the substance.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.360]   Let's talk about all the numbers that support all of this.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.920]   And I think that that tends to be the way that, that most, I think successful
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   pitches go.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.600]   I mean, even if you just look at like, let's, let's, let's zoom out of startup
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.760]   world for a moment and just look at like journalism, right?
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.920]   Like a great story that's written a journalist that wants to bring light to
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.520]   what's happening in a certain part of the world.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.560]   What they'll typically do is they'll start with one person's story, right?
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.240]   This so-and-so and they'll put you right there and then they'll zoom out and
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.400]   they'll talk about the, the, how the magnitude of, of, of the story, right?
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.160]   Like it's not just this one person, but how many people are suffering from the
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.760]   same thing.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.440]   I think it's a very powerful way to, I think, start with story and then roll
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.360]   into substance, but you can try it both ways.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.960]   You can start with the data and the numbers, and then you can tell a story
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.200]   too.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.880]   But I think the key is that you do both right.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.640]   Great story.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.680]   Like, I think we talk a lot about storytelling in the world of business
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.120]   today and it's become kind of an in vogue sort of term, but storytelling in
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.080]   business isn't, isn't sort of getting up in front of a room and saying once upon
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.920]   a time, it's, it's, it's story plus substance.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.600]   You need both.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.840]   And we're talking about an example where you're already ready to tell your
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.400]   story.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.280]   What happens before that?
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.080]   How do you, I know the first step in the book was to convince yourself.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.520]   And I think you mentioned something that I thought was really surprising, which
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.160]   is, you know, you think about someone in your mind who's kind of falls into this
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.800]   criteria of backable and I think charisma is something you think of and you pointed
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.680]   out that conviction is really more important than charisma.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.040]   So where did you kind of come to that conclusion and how do you apply it?
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.240]   Yeah, because when I first started writing the book, I thought that I was
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.080]   going to find a certain style to backable people.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   Like they were all going to speak with, you know, great enunciation.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.800]   They were going to have great hand gestures and pacing and eye contact and
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.080]   just all of like the classic communication things that we learn and, you know, a
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.760]   Toastmasters or a Dale Carnegie.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.000]   But that just didn't, that, that wasn't the case at all.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.080]   What I found was that there were certainly some people who were highly
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.920]   charismatic and that were backable, but there were plenty who were not.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.960]   And, you know, if you want just a quick example of that, go back and watch the
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   original iPhone launch, right?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.080]   2007.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.560]   And we, we remember that as, as a, as an epic, epic speech.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.920]   And it was, it don't get me wrong.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.320]   But if you look at Steve Jobs' communication style, it's not, it's not
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.720]   the poster child of charisma.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.840]   Like he uses the word "uh" over 80 times in the speech.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.560]   He spends a good deal of time sort of staring at his feet.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.160]   Like he does a lot of the things that if you were, if you were to go see a public
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   speaking coach, they would tell you never to do, but it was, it was an
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.040]   incredible, incredible presentation.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.760]   It changed the world.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.560]   And there are plenty and plenty of examples of that.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.040]   What I found is that backable people, it's not charisma that I think makes a
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.640]   person backable, it's conviction.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.280]   Backable people, the common denominator is that they take the time to convince
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.040]   themselves first, and then they let that conviction shine through with whatever
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.360]   speaking style it is that feels most natural to them.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.520]   So, I mean, if you're a charismatic person naturally, don't change that.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.280]   But if you're, but if you're not, like you're more, you're more shy or you don't
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.760]   have some of these classic techniques, what I would say to you is don't spend
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.160]   your time trying to develop those techniques.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.800]   Instead, go to, go to the conviction that you have in the idea.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.240]   And so one of the mistakes that we see sometimes is that people will spend a lot
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.800]   of time creating very slick, you know, sophisticated PowerPoint decks or keynote
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.320]   decks for their meetings, right?
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.720]   They'll come up with an idea and they'll immediately go to the design and to the
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.280]   aesthetic of how they're going to present it, but they don't spend enough time
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.120]   actually thinking about like, why do I believe this is true?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.000]   Like what, what, what are the, what are the potential holes in my thinking?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.440]   What answers do I potentially have for those holes?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.320]   And again, what we're talking about here, again, whether you're your startup or
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.080]   you're talking about inside a company, these are new ideas.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.880]   And so every new idea is going to have holes and it's okay to have that.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.120]   But spending the time to understand why you're convinced and also knowing what
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.760]   you don't know is you're going to be much better off spending your time doing
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.600]   that than creating a PowerPoint deck with a bunch of bullets, but then getting into
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.480]   a room and not really having the substance underneath those bullets.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:11.040]   And what do you say to someone who's, you know, maybe on one end of the spectrum
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.080]   where they have ideas and they're really good at picking them apart and kind of
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.600]   ultimately abandoning them.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.320]   And I think that kind of is me.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.840]   I think part of working in venture capital is saying no a thousand times.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.400]   And so every time I have something I want to do, one option is just like, wait, and
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.000]   if you're still really excited about it for, you know, three days, five days, 10
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.840]   days, keep going.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.800]   But I feel like I've probably had ideas that I picked apart too much and didn't
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   build the conviction in.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.000]   No, I mean, I think that that's definitely, that's definitely the paradox
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.080]   of, of, of being smart in a particular area, right?
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.960]   As an investor, you started to see the holes and ideas, and then you apply that
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.480]   to yourself.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   I, I was talking to an investor the other day who was like, he comes from a FinTech
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.240]   background and he's like, I've, I've passed on every single great FinTech deal,
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.720]   every single one, right?
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.880]   Because I just knew too much.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.000]   And, and, and so I do think that sometimes we can be sort of, I think more rigorous
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.320]   on ourselves than others might be, which is why I think that it is important to, to
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.680]   get out there and get feedback from other people.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.160]   Right.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.880]   And I think that, I think that for you, I mean, you know, look, look at how, look
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   at how far this podcast has come.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.240]   Right.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.960]   And, and where you are right now, I think that potentially back in the day when
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.120]   you were thinking about starting this, right, one of the things that might've
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.800]   been on your mind is like, why does the world need another podcast?
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.120]   Right.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.080]   And you definitely could have gone down the path of like looking at the numbers
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.360]   and saying like, why is this different and all of that.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.960]   And maybe you would have abandoned the idea.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   But my guess is that you probably started talking to some folks and they said,
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.000]   yeah, like this is, this is pretty good.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.560]   And so I, I think it's a combination of a couple of things.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.920]   I think number one is, I think the number one is, is, is starting to build what we
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.240]   call in the book, this backable circle of people who are around you.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.120]   And we can talk a little more about that.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.280]   There are four different types of personalities that we found that people
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.560]   have in this backable circle that they could, they could always go to.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.440]   And, and, and the, and I call those the four C's.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.320]   So the first C is your collaborator.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.480]   And that's the person who, in your case, when you have a, we have a podcast,
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.880]   you're like, look, I, this is my podcast idea.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.240]   And this is somebody who's going to build on top of it.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.120]   And they're going to be like, yeah.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.960]   And what about this?
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.160]   And they're using language like, yes.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.840]   And, and you almost feel like you're in a musical jam session with them.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.040]   This, the second is your, is your cheerleader.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.720]   And it sounds a little sappy, but we all kind of need that cheerleader in our
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.520]   lives, right?
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.080]   It's, it's somebody who can, who can, I think, give us that bit of juice that we
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.320]   need, even if, even if it's not a perfect idea, they're kind of like, you know,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.920]   look, you're going to be able to, you're going to be able to figure it out.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.760]   And what we found is that people, people who are, I think, the most backable,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.840]   extraordinary people, they all have cheerleaders in their corner.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.280]   The third is your coach.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.000]   And your coach is different than your collaborator, because your collaborator,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.080]   while your collaborator is thinking about whether your idea is going to fit the
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.480]   market or fit the company that you're in or fit the team, your coach is really
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.160]   thinking about like, does this idea fit you, right?
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.120]   Is this something that you are going to want to run with?
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.960]   And it kind of gets to your question, Chris, which is like, I don't think any
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.720]   new idea is going to, is going to be without holes.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.760]   Like if it, if it, if it didn't have holes, it probably wouldn't be a new idea.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.600]   But you know, the question is, do you, do you have enough emotional juice to get
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.400]   through the rejections, to get through all the setbacks that are inevitably come up
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:28.960]   along the way?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.440]   Right.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.320]   And you're only going to do that if, if the idea makes you come alive.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.120]   And one of the things that a good coach does is they know us intimately well
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.880]   enough to say, yeah, this is something that you're going to want to run with and
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.800]   keep getting back up every time you get knocked down, because you love this.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.520]   Like, this is what you do, right?
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.600]   Like for me, as a writer, I, I love, I love to write, but when I went, when I,
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.360]   when I went to my wife and I was like, look, I've got ideas for these books.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.360]   She wasn't like, Hey, all these ideas are like home runs.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.640]   But what she said is like, I know that you love to write, like this stuff makes
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.400]   you come alive.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.800]   And no matter what happens, like you're going to, you're going to like want to
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.520]   fight through that.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.400]   And you need a coach who knows you intimately well enough to be able to do
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:10.600]   that.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.440]   And the fourth, the fourth C is your critic, but I like to call this your, your
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:16.920]   cheddar.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.880]   And I call this person your cheddar, because if you've ever seen the movie
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.920]   eight mile, Eminem is surrounded by a circle of friends in the movie, and
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.320]   they're all kind of building him up.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.160]   But there's one friend named cheddar who's constantly poking holes in Eminem's
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.320]   ideas. And we, you know, we, we find throughout the film is that it's really
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   cheddar that gets Eminem ready for the stage.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.280]   And, and I, and I think it's the most underrated member of our circle because
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.320]   we tend to sort of push the cheddars out of our lives, right?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.440]   They can be kind of annoying.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.680]   The no one likes there.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.480]   No one likes people who poke holes in their ideas.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.000]   But what we found is that backable people tend to embrace their cheddar because
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.240]   they really find that it's cheddar.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.040]   Who's going to bring them, you know, get them ready for a big moment.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.720]   I mean, it's funny, as you walk through this example, I think of my wife, who's
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.400]   probably like the, I was like, Oh yeah, she's the collaborator.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.000]   Oh no, she's that.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.880]   Oh, she's the coach.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.120]   I was like, can, can the same person fill multiple roles or do you need four
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.960]   distinct people?
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.160]   No, the same person can fill multiple roles.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.560]   But I, I think the, the key is you want to be clear with people about what it is
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.280]   you need before, before you go in and talk to them.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.560]   So if you're about to go give a pitch or if you're about to go to a big meeting,
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.240]   you don't need cheddar moments before that, right?
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.560]   That's the last thing that you need in that moment.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.280]   You need a cheerleader, maybe you need a little bit of a collaborator.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.840]   So the key is that if you have one person who can play multiple roles, you say to
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.760]   them, look, all right, you know, let's take the reverse example.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.960]   You're early, early on an idea, right?
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.120]   And you're trying to get, you're trying to become aware of what are all the blind
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.920]   spots of the idea.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.800]   Well, then you call a friend, said, look, I need you to be a critic right now.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.760]   I need you to be a cheddar.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.840]   But if your moments before that big moment, you want to call somebody and say, I need
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.800]   a cheerleader right now.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.000]   And so just be very clear with people about what you need.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.800]   Yeah, I'll, I'll go and say this actually applies to so many things.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.080]   I, uh, as many people listening know, I have a newsletter and I remember the first
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.040]   time I asked my wife for feedback, I said, Hey, can you give me feedback on this
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.520]   newsletter?
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.160]   So I sent it to her and she comes back and there's all these comments about all the
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.520]   grammatical mistakes I made.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.840]   And I was like, Hey, I really appreciate you helping me because I made a bunch of
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.480]   typos and edits and all that.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.880]   But I really just wanted to know if it was a good idea to write about this topic.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:41.680]   And so I, I, you could take that lesson and apply it far beyond just ideas that
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.120]   become backable and that whatnot.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.640]   Totally, totally.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.480]   Yeah, no, I mean, same, same thing happens to me, by the way.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.400]   I had to be like, I'm, I'm working on a new book right now.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.240]   And, and, and it's very, very rough.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.440]   We're like in rough shape stage right now.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.520]   I'm writing very, very shitty first drafts.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.880]   And so I'll tell my wife and like, and she's a writer, as you know, and, and
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.720]   she'll say, I'll say to her, look, skip all the stylistic stuff.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.120]   Like, don't like, don't even touch that.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   Just like tell me, like, does this thing flow?
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.160]   Does this thing even make sense at all?
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.240]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.960]   cracks start to emerge.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.080]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:32.680]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one 37,000.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.200]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.

[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.520]   allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.200]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.400]   enjoy is actually so good for you.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.160]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.600]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.040]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:02.280]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.600]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.360]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.720]   toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.200]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.440]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.200]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.440]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.160]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.320]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.920]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.560]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.840]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.280]   And then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.120]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.680]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.480]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.

[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.880]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.960]   I know there are a few other things that you highlight in the book, but
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.320]   before we get there, I want to jump back to how you learned all of this.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.920]   So yes, you reached out to all these people where I'm not even sure if you
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.000]   were thinking about writing a book at the time, but what, what kinds of people
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.320]   wrote back and what were kind of some of the lessons that were themes amongst
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:36.760]   everyone?
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   I mean, I started to put it into practice myself immediately, and I
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.800]   naturally am just a, I'm a note taker.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.400]   And, you know, I, I, I tend to sort of take, you know, when I'm in a meeting
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.880]   with anybody who I'm learning from, I just take copious notes and, and I'm
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.120]   pretty disciplined about that.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.040]   And I would, I would leave every single one of these meetings.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.800]   And, and it was a broad range of people.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.960]   It was, it was, it was military leaders.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.680]   It was, it was celebrity chefs.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.000]   It was, it was people who were producing films.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.160]   It was a lot of people inside Silicon Valley who were on both sides of the
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.840]   table, founders who had done well and investors who invested in founders.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.920]   And so I was taking my notes and I was compiling them and I was starting to
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.000]   realize that a, I really loved having these conversations and wanted to have
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.480]   more of them.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.440]   And so I did, I just continued to do that.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.920]   But B as I was putting these things into practice, like it was working, it was
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.680]   working for me.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.760]   And I started to share some of the nuggets and some of the wisdom that I was
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.440]   getting in these conversations with other people, people who were starting
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.560]   companies, people who were inside companies that were trying to get their
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.440]   ideas made and it was working for them too.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   And so I, I, it took a while.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.000]   I mean, I, I started this process in 2014.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.440]   I didn't start writing the book until 2017 and the book didn't come out until
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.680]   2021 and so it's been a long time in the making.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.480]   The, the way that I sort of themed the book was I really tried to put a tight
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.760]   filter on like the obviousness.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.600]   Like there were a lot of obvious things that came out of these conversations
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.320]   too, right?
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.720]   You need to do your research.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.840]   You need to be prepared.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.360]   Like there are all the sort of obvious things, but I tried to just filter all
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.520]   that out because we already know that.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.160]   And I tried to really search for what was not obvious.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.360]   Convincing yourself first to me, even though now I look at it and I'm like,
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.320]   yeah, that makes sense.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.880]   It was one of those things I never really, I never really did.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.200]   And I noticed that a lot of other people didn't either really taking the time to
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.120]   build that conviction.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.360]   And you know, in the book we go through very specific things that people do to
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.520]   actually build conviction.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.120]   You know, one of the, one of the, one of the things that I, uh, one of the other
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.160]   themes that came out of the book was this idea of playing exhibition matches,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.960]   playing exhibition matches, which I thought was, I think I still think today
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.160]   is, is a really, really important one, which is that like, you know, when we
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.960]   studied backable people, one of the things we found was that they tend to almost
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.680]   have this improvisational style about them, right?
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.840]   Like when they speak, it's almost like they're speaking like they're off the
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:08.040]   cuff, but the reality is that that actually is the product of lots and lots
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.080]   and lots of practice, right?
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.360]   And in fact, the average backable person that we studied was practicing about 21
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.240]   times before they got into a big moment.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.880]   So with any type of new content, any type of new presentation, new idea, it was 21
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.080]   practice rounds before they, before they got into the real thing.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.160]   Now, like a couple of things to keep in mind.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.520]   Number one is like, these practice rounds can be with anybody, you know, like Chris,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.400]   I'm sure like your wife would be on that list.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.840]   Mine, mine would be on mine, right?
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.440]   My daughter, my daughter, my nine-year-old daughter will, we'll do an exhibition
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.160]   match with me every once in a while, right?
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.960]   I just need somebody to kind of listen.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.400]   And it's really important to, I think, do this over and over again.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.720]   Now the number one, the number 21 might seem like a lot because it did to me.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.080]   And I thought to myself, like, isn't that going to make you sound really scripted?
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.400]   Isn't it going to make you sound like robotic if you practice something that
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.880]   much, but what I found is that the opposite happens because once you've
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   actually mastered material at that level, when you sort of understand what you're
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.600]   talking about at that, in that way, what it allows you to do is it allows you to
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.960]   drop your script when you walk inside a room, right?
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.680]   You no longer are sort of married to the outline where you're like, yeah, I'm going
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.920]   to say this and I'm going to say that.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.840]   And I'm going to say that, which is, it tends to be how most presentations are
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.400]   sort of given very linearly.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.240]   When you have mastered your material at that level, what it allows you to do is
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.960]   be fully tuned in, fully present and adaptive to what's happening inside the
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.240]   room.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.200]   If something's resonating a little more, you can double click on that.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.280]   If you find that there's a look of confusion on that person's face, well,
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.360]   then you can take the pause at the right moments and you can start to adapt and
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.320]   you can start to flow.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   Then what we find is that backable moments never really happen when somebody
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.200]   walks into a room and like reads a script and then like drops the mic and
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.000]   leaves like that doesn't happen, right?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.560]   It's a series of interactions.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.720]   It's a back and forth.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.320]   It's a, it's pausing, it's jumping around where these like really productive
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.960]   meetings tend to happen.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.640]   And so mastering your material at that level allows you to have that kind of
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.040]   flexibility and fluidity.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.920]   Uh, one of my favorite quotes from the book is from Charlie Parker, who's this
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.520]   great, who's great jazz musician.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.240]   And, and he had just, not only was he just a great, great musically, but he had
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.400]   this incredible stage presence to him.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.680]   And so one day somebody asked him, they said, they say, Charlie, like, how do you
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   have such incredible presence on stage?
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:37.440]   And Charlie Parker says, well, you got to learn your instrument and then you
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.840]   practice, practice, practice.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.680]   And then before you get up on stage, you forget all of that and you just wail.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.840]   Okay.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.520]   And what we're really trying to do, Chris, I think is we're trying to get to that
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.400]   point where we feel confident kind of just forgetting it, like forgetting all
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.800]   the stuff that we had been, where we committed to memory and just like going
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.160]   in there and just being able to wail.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:34:59.680]   Right.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.640]   And the only way we get there is through lots of practice.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.320]   Two things that come from this that, that I'll share.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.680]   One, I always, if you look at a slide deck of any presentation I've ever given, a
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.280]   stark contrast to many others is that I try to put almost nothing on the slides.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.920]   Right.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.360]   It's, it's an image or a word or maybe three words or, or something, but I don't
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.520]   have a lot of bullets and I've never really been able to articulate why.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.000]   I always see people's presentations and I'm just like, cut it out, cut
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.840]   it out, put small things.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.960]   But now I feel like I can actually articulate it based on what you said,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.920]   which is if you know the content well enough and you want to read the room to,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.480]   you can't have a script sitting behind you or you're kind of forced into a
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.360]   specific conversation and so when you drop a lot of that, it gives you the
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.440]   flexibility to go wherever you want.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.840]   But it at least hones you to say, I'm still going to make this one macro point,
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.440]   but I can make it in whatever way I want.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.320]   So I appreciate you sharing that because I now, I now could articulate
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.000]   why I do this thing I do.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.280]   Well, I'll add to that too, cause I, I, I love that.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.880]   And part of the, one of the things that I think that, you know, backable people
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:17.360]   like yourself tend to do is that they tend to share what something could be,
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.600]   but not exactly how it has to be.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.000]   They share what it could be and not exactly how it has to be.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.320]   And so by having sort of a high level theme, what you're, what you're
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.800]   inviting is a discussion as well.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.200]   And it may be that off that one sort of meta bullet that you have on that, on
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.960]   that slide, instead of the seven bullets, what you're going to do is you're going
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.840]   to prompt the room to start, to start contributing to the conversation.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.360]   And, and that, and that's when just like the best things happen.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.080]   One of the chapters in the book is called flip outsiders into insiders,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.880]   flip outsiders and insiders, right?
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.200]   You want people to ultimately feel like they're an insider in your idea.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.240]   That's, that's when people get interested.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.440]   That's when they get excited.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.960]   You know, what Salman Rushdie, who's one of my favorite authors had this quote,
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.880]   and he said that most of the decisions that happen in our lives, most of the
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.840]   decisions that affect us happen when we're not even in the room.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.160]   Right.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.800]   And I love that because it's so, it's so true, right?
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.240]   You go in and give a pitch, like you were on the investing side, right?
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.000]   At Google ventures, when people came in and pitched you, even if you love the
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.840]   idea, your next step was to go talk to other people at GV, right?
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.720]   You had, you had to start representing the idea.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:33.440]   So now all of a sudden, this, the outcome for this founder is somewhat in your
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.120]   hands, right?
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.280]   They're not in the room anymore.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.680]   You're the one representing their idea.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.480]   And the point is that oftentimes we sort of treat these situations as we're trying
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.720]   to sell that person, almost expecting like that's the final outcome.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.920]   But no, we're not just looking to create people who like our idea.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   We're trying to try to create people who advocate for our ideas, right?
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   They have to go out and they have to sell their other people to sell their
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.320]   partners or their fellow colleagues or other members of the leadership team or
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.560]   whatever, whatever it is.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.440]   And we can only do that if they feel like they are, they have almost founder level
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.480]   passion over the idea, even if they didn't come up with it themselves.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.040]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.600]   And it's something that if I look back fundraising, I tried to do, but I'm not
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.440]   sure I, I did it as well as I would.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.640]   If I tried again, I want to go back really quickly and just point, point out
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:27.560]   something that I know you kind of conveyed, but you didn't title one of the
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.600]   chapters, you need to do some research and prepare for meetings.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.320]   It was play exhibition matches.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:39.080]   And what I took away from that, that was maybe subtle, but also important is that
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.600]   the type of preparation that you should be doing is very similar to the type of
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.880]   action you're going to have.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.840]   So if you're giving a presentation, give the presentation.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.240]   And that is different than reading the slides.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.320]   That's different from writing out the notes and practicing the notes.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.040]   So I just wanted to highlight, unless I got it wrong, that it's really important
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.720]   to match that medium and not just prepare, but actually do the thing you're going
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.000]   to do.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.240]   It's such a good, such a, I mean, I I'm glad you brought it up because like
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.360]   sometimes I forget how important this is and it was impressed upon me many times
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.840]   from all of the people that we studied, which is like, don't give the director's
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.680]   commentary when you're doing these exhibition matches, when you're, when
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.320]   you're giving these practice sessions, give it as if you're in the actual room.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.000]   Right.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.400]   So you're not saying, Hey, so here's what I'm planning on doing.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.320]   I'm going to say this to them and I'm going to say that to them.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.720]   You're just giving the actual thing because what you're doing is you're, is
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.200]   you're building the muscle memory that you're going to need when you're inside
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.680]   the real, the real situation.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.480]   When I was studying for, um, the GMAT, I still remember my, I was speaking and
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.320]   talking to my older brother, who's like a whiz at, at like the standardized tests.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.160]   And I was like, dude, how do you do this?
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.440]   Cause I suck at standardized tests.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.760]   What do I, what do I need to do?
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.200]   And he's like, listen, what time is the test that you're taking?
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.800]   And I was like, I was like at 3:00 PM.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:06.200]   He's like, all right, every day from here until the test at 3:00 PM, you take a
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.520]   practice test every single day.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.400]   Right.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.240]   And I, I, I never would have done that.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.360]   Like I never would have done that.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.000]   I mean, it, it, it, it elevated my game.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.120]   I mean, it was the best, it was the best standardized test I have ever taken.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.200]   Like I did way better than I thought I was going to.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.040]   And it was only because every day at 3:00 PM I took that test.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.160]   And so like applying that to like the world that we're in, if you are, if you
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.640]   have a big meeting coming up with, with the leadership team or you're pitching
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.040]   investors, whatever it is, right.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.240]   What time is that meeting?
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.440]   Is it at 11:00 AM?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.880]   Well, then at 11 AM, start giving these exhibition matches, start
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.040]   doing these practice sessions.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.920]   Like give a practice round every day at 11 AM between here and there.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.880]   And you start conditioning your mind.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.800]   You start getting it ready for the, for the real moment.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.160]   And again, like, like you said, you want to do the, you want to do the real thing.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.440]   The other thing that I, that I completely sort of, I, I, I am terrible at doing is
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.640]   like, I always ask the question after I give a practice session to somebody, I
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.480]   always ask them the question, what did you think?
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.880]   Like, what did you think of that?
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.360]   Right.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:15.040]   And what I realized is that backable people never asked that question because
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.400]   it's just, it's such a low signal question to ask.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.120]   You're not going to get the feedback that you need because typically if you ask
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.160]   somebody like, what'd you think, they're going to be like, yeah, it was pretty
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.440]   good, you know, like, yeah, I liked it.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.480]   And that doesn't really give you the information that you need to be better.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.360]   And so, especially if you're talking to somebody who is informed, the better
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:40.560]   question to ask is what part of all that stood out to you the most, right?
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.680]   Cause now, now they actually have to put some thought into like, they have to
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.360]   stack rank, like here's what the best stuff was.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.120]   And it may turn out that like some of the stuff that you wanted to be the best, the
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.960]   point that you were really trying to make, didn't actually make that cut.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.920]   And that's really good information to have.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.760]   Or the other great question that I love to ask now is how would you
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.600]   describe this idea to someone else?
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.040]   Right.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.000]   And that's something that I do now is as I, especially when I was thinking about
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.360]   new book topics and I sort of have my, you know, two page proposal proposal
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.400]   written is I would hand it to somebody and I'd say, can you read this?
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.160]   And then they'd be like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.280]   And I'd be like, well, how would you describe this idea to a friend?
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:17.800]   Right.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.880]   And what I've found is that oftentimes some of my friends would describe my
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.560]   idea in a way that was much better than I ever could.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.120]   And that ended up being the way that I ended up framing the book.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.760]   Is there a question that you can ask to find some of the stuff that's not good?
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.000]   Right.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.640]   I think that, that helps you rephrase and highlight what, what worked and I'm
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.600]   asking specifically, cause I usually ask guests at the end of this, after we stop
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.000]   the recording, I say, I want to know what I could have done to do a better interview.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.440]   And, uh, you know, I sometimes ask, like, is there a question I should have
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.720]   asked or what question did I ask that really stood out those things?
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.680]   But I'm like, what could I have done better?
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.800]   Like, what did I do wrong?
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.880]   It's like, I'm, I'm always craving me.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.720]   What did I do wrong that I could do better?
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.360]   Well, I mean, I love it.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.240]   I love that you do that.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.320]   I mean, one of the things that really impressed me, this is, let's answer your
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.160]   question is like when we were selling Rise, we sold Rise to a company called
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.320]   One Medical and one of the things that really impressed me from the beginning
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.880]   about One Medical and the founder, a guy named Dr.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:22.600]   Tom Lee was that he had sort of run his brick and mortar, you know, business in
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.800]   the, in the very beginning, it was like literally just him inside a clinic and
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.120]   he was serving every role.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.720]   He was the doctor, he was the nurse, he was the phlebotomist, he was the front
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   desk, he was everything.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.680]   The, one of the things that he did when he was starting out is every time a
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.600]   patient would leave the experience, he'd say, Hey, look, on a, on a scale of, on
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.160]   scale of one to 10, yeah.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.520]   How would you rate this experience?
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.520]   And if it was anything other than a nine or a 10, he would ask, what could I have
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.880]   done that would have made this a nine or a 10, right?
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:57.680]   And I think that that's just like a very positive sort of way, I think, to, to ask
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.080]   that question, but what was really cool about his story is like, because he was
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.320]   serving all roles, he would literally take that feedback and he'd roll it right
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.520]   into the next patient visit.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.600]   So he had this just like, you know, almost like product development, iteration
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.640]   style clinic that he was running.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.680]   And he continued to sort of fold this feedback in over and over and over again
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.240]   until he finally refined this process that he felt like it was ready, ready to
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.720]   scale.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.800]   So, yeah, I think, I think just asking people that, what, what would, what would
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.240]   it have taken to make it a nine or a 10?
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.720]   And that's like, it's so funny.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.680]   It's a classic thing that, yeah, companies do.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.960]   I'm sure everyone here has gotten a survey after buying a product online.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.880]   And the promoter score.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.160]   It's the NPS score.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.200]   And it's so crazy, but people don't actually use that same, if it's the best
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.120]   question that business is used to ask, why are we not using it in our personal
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.520]   lives is kind of something interesting.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:52.760]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.040]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.640]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.

[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.000]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this last bag of beans from

[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.760]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.320]   leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.560]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen, but one of his top hacks
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.200]   was using the microwave more.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.040]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.920]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.000]   with them for this episode.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.360]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.680]   scratch in the microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.600]   code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.640]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.320]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.120]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.360]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.800]   It is so good.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.280]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection they launched
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.360]   last year, you have to check it out.

[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.120]   I'd love to jump quick back to what you were saying about bringing people in.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:38.120]   And I'm curious if you have tactics for bringing people into your idea or your
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.680]   project.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.960]   I think you, you've convinced me of how valuable it is, but how do you actually
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.320]   do it?
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.400]   Yeah, I was kind of the person who would, you know, come into an hour long
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.880]   meeting and I would have like 40 minutes worth of content, right?
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.480]   Like I would have a, I would have a pretty exhaustive slide deck and then I
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.120]   would use that 40 minutes to, to sort of like go through it.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.480]   And then I'd use 20 minutes for Q and A.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.880]   And what I found is that that, that tends to kind of be sort of how most of those
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.760]   meetings go, that 40, 20 split.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   And what I now do is I, I reverse that.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   I walk in with 20 minutes or less of content, like just very, very high level
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:21.520]   and then open it up because I think these backable moments happen when you can sort
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.640]   of get people involved, right?
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.360]   And so that means sharing counterintuitively.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.040]   It means sharing less upfront than you might otherwise share, right?
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.520]   It means, it means just really kind of like setting out what the high level vision
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:39.360]   is, having a few of the details, but then having the, having the rest be in, in
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.720]   backup, like be ready, be prepared to have the discussion.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.840]   You know, one of the misnomers I think that people have is like the misconceptions is
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:51.000]   that, that it takes more time to prepare for a presentation than it does to prepare
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.200]   for a productive discussion.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.640]   That's not true.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.280]   It actually takes a lot more preparation to prepare for a discussion because with the
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.600]   discussion, you have to be able to ask the right questions.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.000]   You have to be able to pull out the right sets of information.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   You have to do a lot of research on the other people who are in the room because
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.760]   you know that they're all bringing certain perspectives in and you're looking to tap
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.880]   into those perspectives too.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.840]   And it sort of bring people in, in a certain way and start weaving all of that
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.320]   together.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.000]   I think it takes a, I think it takes a higher level of preparation.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.560]   And one of the stories that I really enjoyed was I studied a designer who was
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:26.160]   remarkably effective inside big companies, companies like Microsoft and Google.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.120]   And that's hard sometimes as a designer because you are, you're really trying to
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.040]   steer lots and lots of people.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.560]   And especially in bigger companies, when there's lots of red tape and lots of
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.800]   decision makers, kind of be a frustrating role.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.440]   Um, but this guy was remarkably effective at it and I wanted to understand like,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.360]   what was his process?
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.160]   What was it like?
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.240]   And one of the stories that he told me was that when he was starting out, he would
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.800]   always take these really pixel perfect designs into, into these meetings and he
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   would present his vision.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.240]   He put them up on the, you put them up on the wall and people would sort of tear it
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:58.600]   apart.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.320]   They'd be like, well, I don't like that and I don't like that.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:04.360]   And it turned out to be these very unproductive, frustrating meetings for
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:04.640]   him.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.080]   But one day, almost by accident, he, I mean, he forgot his backpack and so he
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.280]   didn't have his laptop, but the meeting was already scheduled.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.160]   And so he literally walks into a room, but he's not able to project these designs
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.280]   because he doesn't have them with him.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   So instead he, he literally goes up to the whiteboard and he begins to draw his
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.880]   design up on the whiteboard.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.840]   So now instead of pixel perfect colors, he's, he's black and white, right?
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:35.360]   And what he said was that people for the first time ever, like got up out of their
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.880]   seats and they like stood behind, stood with him at the whiteboard.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.920]   They started drawing with him and he's like, we got more done in that one hour
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.880]   than I had in like the previous few months trying to get this design done.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.200]   Because like I was, I was, I was going to them and I was trying to get their buy in
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.040]   rather than sort of bringing them in.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.160]   There's a, there's a classic, classic story of Betty Crocker in the 1940s.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.400]   And in the 1940s, Betty Crocker introduced instant cake mix to the market.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.160]   And they were so excited about instant cake mix because they'd done all the
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.720]   research, they'd done all the focus groups and they felt like this was going to be a
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.440]   hit product.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.920]   And so they, they, they put a ton of marketing dollars behind this.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.480]   They get instant cake mix on grocery shelves all around the country.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.360]   And then they wait for the sales numbers to come in.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.320]   And when they do, they're shocked because they find, they find out that nobody is
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:28.760]   buying this instant cake mix and they cannot figure out why.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.560]   And so they hire the psychologist, a guy by the name of Ernest Dykda to go out into
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.480]   the field and start interviewing customers.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.760]   And what Dykda comes back with it like is shocking to the people at Betty Crocker.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:46.120]   He says, I think you have made the process of making a cake too easy, too simple.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:52.000]   Because when a customer removes the cake from the oven, they actually don't feel any
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.880]   ownership over it.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.320]   They actually don't feel like they actually made the cake.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.440]   So Dykda is like, I have a recommendation for you.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.240]   Why don't you remove one key ingredient and just see what happens?
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.720]   And so they do, they remove the egg.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.840]   So now as a customer, you have to go out and you have to buy fresh eggs, you have to
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.800]   bring them back home, you have to crack them into the mix, you have to stir it in, and
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.520]   then you pop it into the oven and sales completely take off, right?
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:19.360]   Because now when the cake comes out of the oven, customers actually felt some
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.600]   ownership over that, over that cake.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.800]   They felt like they had made it themselves.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.400]   And look, I mean, this has been, this has been proven out over and over again through
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.760]   different psychological tests.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.320]   There's a group out of Harvard that calls this the Ikea effect, which basically says
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:36.840]   that we place up to five times the amount of value on something that we help build
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:41.080]   than something that we simply buy off the shelf because, because we made it ourselves.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.520]   And so there's a lot of, there's a lot of people out there with poorly made futons
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.920]   and furniture, and they're never going to get rid of it because it's like, no, I built
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.760]   this, I made it with my own two hands.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.800]   And so what does this have anything to do with what we're talking about?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:53:00.320]   I mean, I think that we oftentimes come in and we treat people like buyers instead of
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.520]   builders, right?
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.040]   What people don't want to be buyers, people ultimately, even if their job is to be an
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.560]   investor, their job is to be a producer, even their job is to green light ideas inside a
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.320]   company, people want to be builders.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.560]   They actually want to feel like they're part of something.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:18.200]   And so your job is to figure out a way to turn them from a buyer into a builder.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.240]   So by the time they leave the room, they actually feel like they have some ownership
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:21.880]   over this as well.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.400]   They were able to crack their own egg into the mix.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:30.320]   Yeah, well, first off, I'll just have to say thank you to Betty Crocker, because I, my
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.960]   wife and I love to bake and she's, she's much better baker than I, but I just don't think
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.760]   you can make a cake as good as cake mix.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.720]   Like it's just, it always tastes so much better.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.880]   So first off, just going to give a little thank you there, but I totally love this theme
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.000]   of if you're anything you're doing, whether you're giving a presentation, whether you're
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.480]   building a product, kind of taking a little bit less out of not trying to do the whole
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.960]   thing for the room, for the partner, for the buyer and inviting them in.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:00.920]   But I'll highlight, you said something and I have a tactic to share, but still being
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.440]   prepared for that discussion.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:08.920]   So when I was out fundraising, when I was out fundraising for my startup, I had a really
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.480]   short deck.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:15.400]   But what I did was I thought of every question that I could possibly get asked.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.840]   And my co-founder, every time someone asked a question that we hadn't thought about, wrote
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.480]   it down.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:24.920]   And for the next pitch, we had a slide that addressed every single question.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.000]   And this wasn't as easy, but I went and memorized the order of all the slides.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.640]   And I did an episode a few weeks ago about memory.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.040]   If you want to kind of improve that, check that out.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.480]   And so someone came and would say, this was about financial advice.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.040]   They'd say, "Well, how do financial advisors spend their time?"
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.480]   And I was like, "32."
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.160]   Boom, slides up, answer there.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.920]   We can have a conversation with data.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.680]   But I didn't walk them through all the questions because I wanted them to be a part of asking
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.240]   and answering and thinking through whether this was a good idea.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:59.640]   And the interesting thing I learned was that if someone asked me a question and said, "Do
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.040]   people really want to pay for financial advice?"
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.360]   And I answered, "Yes, they do.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.160]   And here's why."
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.800]   You know, they kind of bought it.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.600]   But if there was a slide that had my answer written on a screen, people were like...
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.160]   They bought the answer more.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.720]   And all it took was me thinking of every question, writing it up.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   Same answer.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.800]   There wasn't more data.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.280]   It was just written as if it was prepared.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.160]   And by being prepared, it was like, "Yes, this is certain.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.040]   This person's not just giving me the answer I want to hear.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.440]   This was the answer they were going to give no matter what."
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.560]   They're not ad-hoc-ing.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.760]   They're not BS-ing me.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.360]   And so I always tell people, "Take that Q&A."
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.160]   And you might not use 75% of the slides.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.880]   But write up a slide for every question you might get.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.760]   And it just makes the answer you give people so much stronger.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.720]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.520]   I love that.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.400]   It's great.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.600]   It was actually the only use case for the...
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.080]   Apple, for like a while, had this touch bar.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.880]   And it was like I could slide through slides and try to find them.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.160]   But it's a useless product.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.440]   They got rid of it finally.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.560]   In the conversation of meeting people and trying to bring them in,
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.760]   one of the things I think I and probably many people struggle with is...
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   Yeah, if you schedule a meeting, it's really easy to kick off that meeting.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.160]   But what about when you are at an event,
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.280]   and you see someone, you're like, "This person could add value.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.400]   I'd love to bring them in.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.200]   I'd love to bring them in to be an insider in what I'm doing.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.160]   But I don't know them.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.680]   And I'm walking up to this person."
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.800]   And some people have the ability to walk up to anyone
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.600]   and start a conversation and bring them in.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.240]   And I know running for Congress, you did this thousands of times.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.640]   Going up to complete strangers and trying to build that rapport really quickly.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.480]   What advice do you have for someone who's, let's say, at a conference,
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.320]   sees someone much more senior to them, maybe runs another company,
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.400]   very successful, could add a lot of value?
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.280]   How do you walk up and engage that person?
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.680]   What are the backable traits of people that do that well?
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.640]   It's a great question, Chris.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:00.040]   Even after doing it thousands of times, I don't know if I've mastered that.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.800]   I feel like I've never quite been great at small talk,
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.520]   which is not great if you're running for political office.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:11.960]   But what I would say is that I think that asking good questions
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:16.600]   is such an underappreciated art, right?
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:21.080]   And I think that one of the things that we tend to do is we tend to sort of, you know,
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:26.040]   we use those precious key moments that we tend to have with somebody,
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.240]   kind of just asking the same old stuff sometimes.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.040]   Like, "How you doing?"
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.320]   Like, "How's it going?"
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:36.040]   And I think that there are oftentimes much more precise
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.400]   things that we can ask people.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:41.720]   And I think that anytime that you are interested in getting somebody involved,
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.000]   rather than going out and immediately pitching them,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.880]   one of the things that I try to do is I try to put myself in information collection mode, right?
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.840]   Like, "What are they up to these days?
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.960]   What are they most interested in?"
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:03.400]   And so, one of the things I try to get from people is like,
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.920]   you know, "Hey, what are some of the things that you feel like are working the best right now?"
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.000]   Like, if it's an investor, for example, like,
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.800]   "What are some of the things in your portfolio that you're most proud of right now?"
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.040]   Right?
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:14.760]   Like, what do you...
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.720]   And potentially even asking like, "What do you feel like, you know,
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.280]   you thought was going to happen and surprised you?"
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:20.600]   Right?
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.840]   "What were the biggest surprises this year?"
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.680]   is a question that I might ask somebody.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:30.440]   You know, but I really am trying to use those few moments not to sell myself,
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.200]   but really try to get some signal on who this person is, right?
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.800]   That's one thing.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.520]   The second thing I would say is that oftentimes we go in for the kill too quickly, right?
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:46.840]   And like, even like running for office, like, I saw people who were like,
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.960]   "I'd love your vote."
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.200]   Right?
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.880]   Like, they'll walk up like, "I'm running for office.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.600]   I'd love your vote."
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.680]   And it's like, it never works.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.720]   Like, it's like, it's too soon.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:59.640]   And what you want to do is you want to get to know this person.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.120]   Who are you?
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.400]   Like, I'm talking to a voter.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.080]   Like, what are the things that you care?
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.360]   What do you care most about?
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:10.520]   What is going to be the thing that matters most to you when you end up voting in November?
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.000]   Right?
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.320]   And questions like that are questions that let me understand who this person is.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.520]   And I think that we need to sort of evolve from like going in for the kill
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.680]   to more of the thing like the one-two punch,
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:25.800]   where it's like phase one is really learning everything you can about this person.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.240]   And then phase two is setting up a follow-up meeting.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.200]   And saying, you know, "I'd love to share this with you."
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:35.880]   But then the thing that I think is like most important and almost never done
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.640]   is like as soon as you go home or like go off to the side
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.520]   and like write down everything that you just learned.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:42.760]   Right?
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.360]   Like literally pull out a note on your phone
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.960]   and write down like the four or five things that you've learned from that conversation.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   Because when you go back and talk to that person,
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.480]   you want to make sure that you're weaving those into the conversation.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.080]   Like you're reacting and responding to the information that they've given you.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.040]   - Yeah, I always get the email.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.040]   And I don't think I always write the notes down.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.840]   And three days later, you're like, "Gosh, what were we talking about?
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.880]   I met so many people."
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.920]   So I love the idea of I leave the email in my draft,
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.040]   but I should go back and just add a few bullets beforehand,
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.640]   even if they're not what I'll actually send.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.800]   - I think people, no matter what, at all levels, no matter who they are,
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.360]   I think at the end of the day, we all want to feel heard.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:22.600]   Right?
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.280]   We all want to feel heard.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.120]   And it's just so universal.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.000]   It's so primal.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.720]   And oftentimes, we just don't show people that.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.240]   We might actually even hear them,
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.560]   but we don't actually show them that we heard them.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.040]   You know, like the people who I studied inside bigger companies
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.680]   that were just amazing, amazing at navigating
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.440]   and like corralling people around them.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.280]   One of the art forms that they were able to sort of really get down
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.920]   was that even if they disagreed with people,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.440]   they would always sort of let them know that they had considered their feedback.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:58.680]   Right?
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.600]   Like, for example, there was an executive that I sort of shadowed,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.040]   who what she did is she would, every time people had feedback for her,
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.400]   she would write it down.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.120]   Right?
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.320]   And then when she was coming back into the follow-up meeting,
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.800]   what she would do is she'd start the meeting by putting all that feedback up.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:15.960]   Right?
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.880]   Like she would literally project all the feedback.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.240]   And she'd say, "Here are all the things that I heard during our last meeting.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.360]   And here's what I ended up doing with that feedback."
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.240]   And it wasn't always like, "I responded to it.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.080]   And now it's part of the new idea."
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.720]   But it was like, "No, sometimes I didn't respond to it.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.800]   But I want you to know that like I tracked it.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.760]   I heard it.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.960]   Like you have been heard."
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.320]   And yeah, it doesn't make people feel 100% when you've shared an idea
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.160]   and it wasn't used.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.040]   But it sure as hell feels a lot better than someone saying,
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.920]   "Huh, that's interesting."
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.960]   And then doing nothing with it.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.280]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   Yeah, I think it goes back to when you emailed people for advice
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.120]   and you got such a great response rate.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.280]   Obviously, you kind of got to show this,
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.200]   "Hey, look, The New York Times called me a failure.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.480]   Have some pity on me."
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.080]   But I do think the message that probably worked
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.720]   and drove people to answer is you weren't saying,
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.840]   "Can you do me a favor?"
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.800]   You were saying, "Can you share your learnings or your..."
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.080]   I always, when I write those emails, ask people to share their wisdom.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.160]   Because I feel like wisdom is like a word that's like,
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.520]   "Hey, I think you're smart.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.120]   And I'd love to learn from you."
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.080]   And so I go back and think that that's probably
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.760]   why you saw such a high response rate
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.880]   is because people want to be heard.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.200]   - I think that's totally right, man.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.080]   I think that's totally right.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.800]   And I think people want to share their story as well.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.880]   And I think that if you're coming across as somebody
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.240]   who doesn't necessarily have an agenda,
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.720]   I think that's really important.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.040]   I think there's a story in the book
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.360]   that I wish I could have brought in sooner, right?
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   Because it ended up making the last chapter of the book.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.280]   And so I feel like sometimes people don't finish books.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.920]   And so it probably may have gotten lost in the shuffle.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.120]   But it's the story of a guy named George Schaller.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.360]   And Schaller was this primatologist
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.440]   who was just amazing at what he did.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.360]   And part of the reason he was amazing at his work
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.640]   is that he was able to get closer to mountain gorillas
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.160]   than really anybody else.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.480]   Like the way that he would approach them,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.480]   they somehow let him in,
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.440]   in a way that they wouldn't let other people in.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.920]   And so Schaller is at this conference one day,
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.000]   and he's presenting his findings.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.520]   And finally, somebody in the audience gets up,
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.760]   and they're like, "Listen, Dr. Schaller, I don't get it.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.520]   "Why is it that these mountain gorillas
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.800]   "are allowing you to get so close?"
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.760]   And he says, "Look, it's simple.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.480]   "I never carry a gun, no matter what.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.600]   "I never carry a weapon."
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.400]   And that confused everybody.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.640]   Because they're like, "Well, okay, well, all right.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.960]   "We carry weapons, but they're in our backpack.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   "And we're not like waving it around or anything like that.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.400]   "It's like, it's tucked away.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.440]   "It's out of sight."
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.360]   And Schaller's theory was, "Look, you can hide your attitude.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.480]   "You know, you can hide a gun,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.360]   "but you can never really hide your attitude around a gun.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.680]   "And if you have it, and it's in your backpack,
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.440]   "you're always gonna behave a little bit differently."
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.560]   And there's that little bit of difference,
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.000]   that little energetic shift,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.720]   that these gorillas can pick up on.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.040]   Because it's just, it's so primal for us.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.960]   And I think about that a lot,
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.680]   because oftentimes, when I catch myself
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.720]   trying to sound smart,
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.440]   or I try to catch myself trying to come off it,
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.200]   like with an agenda, a hidden agenda,
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.760]   I realize that there's an energy that comes with that.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.800]   And to become pure about it, like in your case,
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.040]   "Look, I just really just wanna learn from you,"
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.640]   I think is why people are responding.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.280]   And I think you're getting some really great guests,
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.200]   myself not included, but some really great guests,
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.880]   like Johannes Marlowe and Tim Ferriss.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.560]   And it's really been an amazing show.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.520]   - Thank you.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.160]   Yeah, I mean, we covered so, I mean, first of all,
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.720]   everyone, there's so much more on each of these in the book.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.800]   And I actually made it through the whole book.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.440]   You're welcome.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   I didn't make it through the appendix yet.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.320]   But yeah, the one thing that we didn't touch on
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.480]   that I had a question on that I wanna jump to,
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.160]   and you shared, it's about finding an earned secret
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.520]   and uncovering the information that's not obvious that,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.680]   and you just mentioned the questions people don't get asked.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.440]   And you shared a great story
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.000]   about how you use that to get a job.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.160]   But my question is,
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.880]   do you have any tips for finding those secrets,
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.480]   uncovering those things,
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.080]   and maybe give a little bit more context on the chapter?
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.200]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.920]   I mean, one of the people that I studied for this book
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.120]   was Brian Grazer.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.280]   And Brian's a legendary Hollywood producer.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.280]   He has over 130 Emmys.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.560]   He has dozens of Oscars,
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.000]   but he also runs large teams, runs large companies,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.040]   and he invests in technology companies as well.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.000]   And so it was interesting when I went to go see him,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.520]   this is before the pandemic,
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.200]   and I'm in his waiting room in Beverly Hills.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.920]   There are people there ready to pitch him
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.120]   on all sorts of things,
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.840]   from films to technology to apply for jobs.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.600]   And you could just tell that like,
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.240]   it was really anxious inside that room.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.840]   Like people were really nervous.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.080]   And so when I went back to see him, I said,
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.200]   "Look, Brian, if I could have given everybody out there
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.640]   one piece of advice before they showed up here today
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.360]   on how to prepare for a meeting with Brian Grazer,
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.760]   what would that piece of advice have been?"
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.120]   And he thought about that for a moment.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.960]   And he said, "Give me something
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.720]   that I can't easily find on Google.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.320]   Like give me something that's not obviously Googleable."
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.000]   And I thought that was so interesting
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.280]   because the more that I talked to gatekeepers,
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.720]   decision makers, people who are classic backers,
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.120]   what I found is that like great meetings
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.680]   tend to be based on an insight
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.640]   that the person who's doing the pitching
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.720]   went out and found themselves.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.320]   Like they didn't just sit behind a desk,
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.160]   but they went out and like found something
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.680]   that may have been just a little bit like less obvious.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.920]   It doesn't have to necessarily be watershed,
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.560]   but they really put themselves into the story
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.200]   and found something that maybe they wouldn't have found
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.000]   had they just done sort of the classic research.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.400]   So that could be test driving a competitor's product.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.640]   That could be going out to, you know,
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.000]   like literally attending a show or attending something
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.640]   that like maybe other people wouldn't have attended.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.280]   It's like just taking, like thinking to yourself,
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.080]   I like to kind of almost do a two-step approach to this.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:15.800]   I think to myself,
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.680]   like what would most people do to prepare for this?
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.240]   And then how do I put myself
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.640]   just one step further into that story?
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.680]   Like what can I do to go one step beyond that
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   that takes me from behind Google
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.600]   and into the real world in some way?
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.640]   And it could just be call,
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.800]   it could literally just be calling a set of customers
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.560]   and asking them what they think about this.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.920]   When I was talking to somebody the other day,
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.680]   I know we've been talking a little bit
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.960]   about like applying for jobs.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.560]   And I was talking to somebody the other day,
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.080]   and this was after my book came out,
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.680]   and she called me and she told me this story.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.760]   And the story was that she was applying for a job.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.600]   She was a mom and, you know,
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.280]   she was returning to the workforce
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.080]   and she was applying for a job at a social media company.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.600]   And the trick of it was like, she didn't use the product.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.160]   Like it was very much like a Gen Z focused product
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.960]   and she doesn't use it.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.840]   And so, and she's like, she's like,
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.280]   so I was trying to figure out like what to do
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.520]   to prepare for this meeting for this role.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.880]   And I was doing all my research.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.640]   I was coming through the site and reading people's bios
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.400]   and doing all this stuff that we typically do.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.280]   But then she's like, you know,
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.120]   I need to do something more than this.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.680]   So what she did is she decided to interview
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.600]   every single one of her daughter's friends.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.840]   Every single one of her daughter's friends,
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.640]   she interviewed them and like,
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.160]   what do you like about the product?
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.520]   What do you not like about the product?
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.880]   What do you wish would be different?
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.840]   All this stuff.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.000]   And she accumulated all this research.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.520]   And then she goes into this interview,
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.400]   which is over Zoom during the pandemic.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.360]   It's over Zoom.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.400]   And she literally like starts like dropping
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.480]   all this like research onto this person.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.160]   Now, I don't know how much of it was different,
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.320]   how much of it that they didn't already know,
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.560]   but the fact that she had gone out there,
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.160]   like and done all this research
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.320]   and all this stuff that like people typically don't do.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.280]   This hiring manager was so impressed
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.720]   that not only did she get the job,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.760]   but right in the middle of the meeting,
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.360]   he actually patched in one of their UX designers
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.920]   who's like, "Hey, like you need to meet this person.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.400]   And I want the two of you to spend time together after this
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.920]   because she collected a bunch of stuff
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.880]   that might be useful to you."
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.080]   So I just think that taking yourself
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.960]   one step beyond what most people would do
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.720]   to try to find something that might be
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.000]   a little less obvious.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.280]   I mean, it just, it does wonders.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.480]   - Yeah.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.640]   I mean, find something that might not be obvious
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.520]   or even just do something that other people don't do.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.800]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.280]   I've had people, when I was hiring,
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.120]   that it's amazing how few people do that.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.000]   Like the amount of effort you have to put in
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.720]   to stand out as a job applicant,
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.760]   as a presentation giver,
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.280]   it's low because so many people just do the minimum.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.040]   And so I made a presentation.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.520]   It was funny.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.440]   I wanted this job at this hot startup back probably 2010.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.880]   And I made a presentation.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.320]   They were in the location space.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.720]   And I made a presentation about location services.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.280]   I looked back, right, and I got the job.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.120]   And I've looked back now and I was like,
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.960]   "That presentation was horrible."
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.080]   I took some dumb market research report
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.040]   that had no relevance to what we were building.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.880]   And I put it in a slide deck
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.800]   and I made some slides that were kind of silly.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.720]   And like, it was a terrible presentation
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.480]   that added no value to the company.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.240]   But the fact that I made it gave them some knowledge
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.000]   that I actually cared about the company
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.840]   because I wouldn't have taken the time to do this.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.840]   - So they didn't ask you.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.360]   They didn't ask you to make the presentation.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:26.840]   You just made it.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.320]   - No, no, no.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.960]   I was like, instead of saying, "Hey, I want to work here."
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.600]   I said, "Hey, I made a presentation
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.200]   about the industry you guys are in
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.480]   and I would love to share it with you."
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.200]   - Yeah, love that.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.800]   - And I want to work here.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.160]   Now, the funny thing is,
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.120]   there were no unique insights in this presentation.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   The unique insight was maybe that
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.880]   here's a person who cares about your company.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.040]   So if I could have found a unique insight,
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.560]   it would have been even more valuable.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.760]   I'll just say that even without the unique insight,
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.680]   going above and beyond can add a ton of value.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.640]   I mean, one of the reasons I think investors
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:04.280]   started to lean in on my idea for Rise
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.240]   was when they found out
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.960]   that I was going out to Weight Watchers meetings
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.280]   and I was standing outside of Weight Watchers meetings.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.360]   And when people were walking in, I'd be like,
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.880]   "Hey, I've got this prototype for a new app.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.040]   Could I give you a demo?"
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.960]   And look, the vast majority of people said no,
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   but every once in a while, somebody would say yes.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.680]   And I never really shared that story
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.120]   because it was kind of embarrassing for me.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.880]   And also, it's not one of those sophisticated
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.520]   sort of Silicon Valley ways of acquiring customers, right?
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.760]   I was a guy on the street.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.080]   But somebody asked me in one of the early meetings,
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.120]   somebody asked me,
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.960]   "How did you find your first customers?"
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.400]   And so I told him the story.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.160]   And that turned out to be the part of the pitch
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:45.960]   that he loved the most.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.480]   He's like, "I love that."
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.080]   And so I started playing that up.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.840]   And yeah, and that turned out to be the part
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.280]   that investors love the most
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280]   is putting yourself out there.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.440]   There's a story in the book about this publisher
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.720]   named Jonathan Karp,
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.840]   who really wanted to get Howard Stern to write a book.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.240]   And I talked to Jonathan and he was like,
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.360]   "I had been pursuing Howard Stern for 10 years
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.160]   to write a book and he never would."
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.920]   And his answer to me was,
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.840]   "Look, I already have a couple of bestselling books
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.520]   and writing a book takes a lot of time.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.040]   I don't want to write another book.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.240]   Leave me alone."
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.400]   And finally, Jonathan Karp was like,
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.920]   "Look, what do I need to do
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.000]   in order to get him to say yes?"
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.200]   And he thinks about it and he's like,
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.880]   "The vast majority of what Howard Stern would write about
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.840]   is actually kind of already out there right now.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.760]   It's in his interviews, right?"
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.280]   Because what he would probably do in this book
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.320]   is he'd probably be writing about
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.920]   like the most interesting people
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.360]   that he's interviewed for this show.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.720]   And so what Jonathan Karp did
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.600]   is he literally took transcripts of all these interviews
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.160]   and personally called those down
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.320]   into something that was very readable
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.640]   and then put them in a leather-bound cover
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.880]   and he shows up at Howard Stern's apartment
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.080]   and Howard Stern's like,
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080]   "Look, I told you I'm not going to write this book."
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.760]   And Jonathan Karp's like, "Well, here's the book."
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.040]   Like literally hands it to him.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.120]   And what Howard Stern said is like in that moment,
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.840]   he was so intoxicated by the effort
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.640]   that Jonathan Karp had put into the process
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.840]   that he could not say no.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.360]   - That's amazing.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.640]   Maybe one day I'll get there
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.240]   and somebody's going to write my book for me
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.040]   and just hand it to me.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:14.920]   That would be, you know,
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.200]   that's how you know you made it
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.040]   when someone out there writes a book for you.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:18.840]   - Well, in the meantime,
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.600]   we're looking forward to you writing your own book, Chris.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.400]   - Yeah.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.120]   So I feel like that story comes back to where we started
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.680]   about having the conviction to get out there
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.320]   and believe in your idea and get in front of other people.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.080]   I want to wrap with a few things.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.400]   Is there a story that didn't make it in the book
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.120]   that you wished it?
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.640]   - Yeah, there was a theme
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.080]   that I had been really playing with
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.880]   and I really wanted to make it work,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.360]   but I felt like it wasn't ready.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.360]   But today I definitely do feel like it is,
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.160]   which is that when we walk into a room,
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.480]   we are a combination of both the information that we bring
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.400]   and the energy that we bring.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.920]   And oftentimes when we prepare for a meeting,
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.360]   we're preparing for the information,
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.600]   but we're not really preparing for the energy.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.240]   One of the things I think about
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.360]   before I walk into a room now
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.360]   is how do I want people to think?
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.520]   What do I want people to do?
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.400]   But most importantly, how do I want them to feel
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.160]   as a result of this meeting?
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.200]   What's the feeling that I want people to have?
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.120]   Because I think Maya Angelou said it the best,
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.960]   which is people will forget what you said,
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.400]   people will forget what you did,
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.480]   but they will never forget the way that you made them feel.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.760]   And the reason that I think this is important
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.680]   is that we are living in such a back-to-back world now,
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.400]   especially for those of us who are working remotely,
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.920]   it can be very easy to sort of just jam your schedule
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.560]   with meetings and go back to back to back.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.920]   But I think it's become so, so important
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.320]   to just take a few minutes in between these meetings,
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.480]   to literally just schedule 55-minute meetings
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.880]   instead of 60-minute meetings
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.760]   in order to give yourself that five minutes that you need
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.200]   in order to reset,
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.440]   in order to kind of reset your energetic state.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.800]   Because we know the information
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.080]   we wanna bring the next meeting,
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.840]   but if all we're doing is compiling
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.560]   sort of like the energy decline,
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.440]   then by the time we get to
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.600]   some of our most important meetings or moments,
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.280]   we might actually be bringing the wrong energy
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.720]   into the room or to the space.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.440]   And so what I think is extremely important right now
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.240]   is to have what I call rhythmic recovery.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.640]   And again, the way that I think about that
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.960]   is like for every 55 minutes,
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.080]   I take five minutes to just like recover energetically, right?
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.240]   And that could be doing a breathing exercise,
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.760]   that could be doing pushups,
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.080]   but just something to kind of reset my energy
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.760]   so that what I'm bringing to my next meeting
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.120]   isn't just like accumulation of like the negative stuff
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.320]   that's been happening throughout the day.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.000]   - I love that.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.080]   I'll add one interesting thing
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.280]   that someone told me once is,
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   you might be in a situation
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.080]   where you just have to bring
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.360]   the negative energy to the meeting.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.480]   You're 10 minutes late,
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.760]   your last meeting was horrible,
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.520]   you gotta go.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.280]   Someone once, I can't remember,
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.280]   there was kind of like a stoplight methodology,
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.000]   but it was basically when you come into a meeting,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.520]   if you have negative energy,
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.160]   call it out.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.760]   And sometimes that can change the dynamic.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.520]   You could say, "Hey guys, I just wanna let you know,
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.120]   my last meeting was really terrible.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.560]   I'm not in a great mood,
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.400]   but I'm really excited to be here.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.920]   So if that comes across,
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.480]   just know that it has nothing to do with this meeting."
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.040]   And you can kind of, I use this a lot,
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.720]   even in presentations,
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.280]   call out the thing that might be a problem.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.520]   Hey, I don't have data
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.280]   on whether my customers will do this,
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.120]   that you use this product.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.680]   If that's a problem, I can just stop now.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.040]   And you kind of like shove aside,
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.880]   whatever it is, negative energy,
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.960]   or a part of your business
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.800]   or your proposal that doesn't work,
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.240]   and lay that out at front.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.960]   So people kind of get to take that off
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.440]   their kind of mind throughout the conversation.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.960]   No, I mean, Reid Hoffman told me a great story.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.240]   He's founder of LinkedIn
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.440]   and he was telling me about how in 2003,
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.400]   he was, he's pitching the company,
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.440]   but this is like shortly after
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.200]   the dot-com bubble had burst, right?
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.960]   And now he's got this company
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.040]   that isn't making a dime of revenue
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.400]   and all investors want
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.160]   are companies that are making money.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.440]   And so he's out there
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.200]   and he's pitching LinkedIn.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.960]   And one of the things he said
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.280]   that really saved him during that time
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.160]   is that he would steer into the objection.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.840]   He steered right into the objection
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.000]   of not having, not making money.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.920]   So upfront, he would say,
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.200]   "Listen, before we move into like all the strengths,
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.800]   all the reasons I think you should invest,
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.640]   I want you to tell, I want to tell you upfront
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.560]   that we're not making revenue right now,
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.160]   but, you know, further on,
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   I'm going to talk about three ways
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.840]   in which I think we might be able to
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.120]   over the next few years, right?
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.680]   I'm gonna share three, three ideas I have."
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.560]   And so these three ideas were not bulletproof.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.840]   They, they, they weren't, they weren't,
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.200]   they weren't completely solid.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.280]   But what he said is just by sharing that upfront,
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.720]   by steering into the objection,
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.960]   what that did is it bought him a lot of credibility, right?
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.000]   'Cause he was willing to sort of put that out there himself.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.200]   And then to your point, Chris, like because he did that,
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.280]   that objection stopped nagging at them, right?
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.120]   Because if he hadn't said that,
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.720]   then like the idea that they weren't making money
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.240]   would have nagged at them the entire time.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.080]   So he could have been talking about the cool product,
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.240]   the cool features, all the cool things they want to do,
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.200]   the network effects.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.160]   And yet at the same time,
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.920]   like they would have been nagging at them the whole time.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.760]   And now that he already put it out there,
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.800]   they could actually tune into
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.960]   the stronger parts of this pitch.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.360]   - Yeah, that's fantastic.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.560]   Okay, I feel like if you want more content like this,
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.520]   just read the book.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.880]   I'm not gonna dig any deeper.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.240]   It was fantastic.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.440]   I actually listened to it.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.360]   I heard you were the narrator,
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.800]   which was, it's a little weird.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.840]   I'm hearing you tell stories.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.120]   I'm like, "Man, I've heard this story."
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.040]   But no, it's 'cause I heard you read the book,
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.240]   not 'cause we talked about it.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:46.040]   So I just wanna know, you wrote the book.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.640]   It came out earlier this year.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.360]   What's next?
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.720]   What are you spending your time on now?
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.240]   I mean, the next book that I'm working on
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.120]   with Harper Collins is all about energy.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.400]   It's all about how do we get more energy?
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.760]   And I'm trying to do the same thing
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.800]   that I did with Backable,
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.200]   which is like skip the obvious diet, sleep,
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.880]   and start going into sort of
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.640]   what are some things that are hidden?
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   And what I'm finding is that it's taking me
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   not only into just modern science,
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.680]   but it's also taking me back to ancient wisdom,
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.640]   things that we have lost along the way.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.440]   The art of what we might know as chi
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.120]   or what the Hindus call prana.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.000]   There's a lot of things that we sort of
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.640]   have just kind of lost that we,
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.880]   I think in a busy society, we don't think about,
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.320]   but there are certain people
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.320]   who I think have become just masters
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.440]   at being able to manage their energy,
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   not just their time, but their energy,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440]   that have done incredible things for the world.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.880]   So I'm studying those people.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.480]   I'm studying these techniques.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.000]   I'm studying the science.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.760]   And the idea is to bring it all together
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.720]   in one coherent book that anybody can use
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.320]   and how to boost their energy.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.640]   - That's amazing.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.600]   You know, you said last time
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.960]   you started doing these interviews
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.040]   and it was years before the book came out.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.520]   How long might we have to wait to read this?
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.880]   - This one's going to be a little quicker.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.840]   This one's going to be a little quicker.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.760]   I mean, it's something that, yeah,
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.520]   I've been thinking about for a very long time.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.320]   And I sort of just, even while I was writing Backable,
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.240]   I was collecting research.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.720]   It's just, it's always been a fascinating topic for me.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.840]   You know, especially, I mean,
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.200]   I don't know how you feel about this, Chris,
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   but I certainly feel like I have less energy
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.640]   than I did 10 years ago, right?
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:29.400]   And yet the demands on my energy are so much more, right?
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.760]   And I think most people feel that way.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.800]   If you ask most people, like,
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.040]   "Hey, do you feel more energy or less energy
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.000]   "now than you did 10 years ago?"
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.280]   Most people are going to say less energy.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.640]   But then you ask them, like,
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.080]   "What about the demands on your energy?
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:39.960]   "Are they more or are they less?"
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.160]   And then they're more, right?
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.760]   And so it's no surprise that people burn out very quickly.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.680]   And it used to be that you hear about people
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.440]   who burnt out in their 40s and 50s.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440]   And now it's like people are burning out
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.640]   in their teens and 20s and it's happening much sooner.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.720]   And so I think we just need an answer to this.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.080]   And so there's urgency.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.440]   So I want to get it out there.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.720]   Obviously do the real work and go really deep.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.520]   But the idea is get out there next year,
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.640]   if not early the year after.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.240]   - Awesome.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.280]   Well, I can't wait.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.200]   Is there anywhere people can follow along
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.240]   as to what you're working on
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.440]   and what you're up to until then?
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.360]   - Yeah, you can go to my website.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.120]   It's just suneilgupta.com or check me out on social.

[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.600]   - This is great, Chris.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.480]   Thanks so much for having me on.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.360]   - That was so fantastic.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.880]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.760]   I can't wait to start using some of Suneil's tactics
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.640]   as I keep growing everything I'm doing with all the hacks.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.080]   If you have thoughts, questions,
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.600]   or just want to say hi, I'm chris@allthehacks.com.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.360]   And please check out the newsletter
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.840]   at allthehacks.com/email.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.960]   That's it for this week.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.480]   See you all next week.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:11.000]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.320]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.000]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.160]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.400]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.280]   And it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.440]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.400]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.320]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.000]   who truly believes that everyone
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.520]   in this world can build wealth.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.200]   And his passion and excitement
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.680]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.520]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   But recently I listened to an episode
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.760]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.120]   that will blow your mind.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.880]   And it was so crazy to learn things
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.920]   like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.760]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.440]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:59.160]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.800]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.680]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.760]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.080]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.760]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.400]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
