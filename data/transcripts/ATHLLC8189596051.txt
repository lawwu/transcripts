[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:10.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.700]   about upgrading your life, money, and travel all while spending
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.840]   less and saving more. I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.080]   excited to have you here. Okay, so today I'm talking to Sunil
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.760]   Gupta. He's the best selling author of Backable, a really
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.560]   amazing book about the surprising truth behind what
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.200]   makes people take a chance on you. He is also the founding
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.680]   CEO of the nutrition coaching app Rise, which was named App of
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.880]   the Year by Apple before selling to One Medical. He later ran for
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.360]   US Congress, served on the faculty at Harvard, and is
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.240]   currently an emissary for gross national happiness between the
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.480]   United States and the Kingdom of Bhutan. I'm not even sure what
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.880]   that means. But it sounds pretty cool. And in this conversation,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.200]   we'll dig into his background and the research that uncovered
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   seven surprising changes that course corrected his life and
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.440]   his career by letting him go from being embarrassed to speak
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.200]   inside team meetings to confidently pitching ideas
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.640]   inside the offices of people like Michelle Obama and Tim
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.600]   Cook. We'll learn what it takes to have a seemingly mysterious
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.680]   superpower that lies at the intersection of creativity and
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.720]   persuasion, something he calls becoming backable. Why is this
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.880]   important? Because we all have a brilliant idea tucked away
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.240]   somewhere, yet most of us are afraid to share it and have it
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440]   be dismissed. So I hope you enjoy this conversation with
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.240]   Sunil Gupta. Sunil, thank you for being here.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.560]   Chris, it's just it's great to be here. Thanks so much for
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.000]   having me.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.960]   Yeah, I want to start with a fun story. I don't know if I've ever
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.760]   shared this with you. But back in 2009, I also had my own face
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.920]   of failure story. And I got laid off. And I started a conference
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.320]   called laid off camp. So I was doing everything I could to
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.200]   promote this conference. I was just hoping that someone would
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   write about it. People would learn about it. And I kept
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.840]   striking out. And so one day, I got this email from a reporter
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680]   who asked if I could participate in a story. And I was so
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.640]   excited. After the interview, I called a friend of mine who knew
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.320]   everyone in tech. And I said, Hey, this reporter from Tech
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.920]   Crunch reached out to me. I did this story. I'm so excited. And
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.720]   he was like, Who was it? I talked to him. He goes, Yeah,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   that person doesn't work at TechCrunch. I was like, What do
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.280]   you mean? We searched online, there wasn't ever a story that
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.800]   had been written by this person. And we concluded that I got
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.840]   totally punked. So my excitement, my excitement was
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   like, turn south. And the next morning, a story actually came
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280]   out on TechCrunch, written by Lena Rao, who also happens to be
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.840]   your wife. So that's my my connection to your family from
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.680]   way back and my story of kind of recovering from failure.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.440]   This this interview has already started out at a very, very meta
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.600]   level. It's unbelievable. Yes. I mean, I, I love that story. And
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.280]   I think my failure, my failure story is that I was out there
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.200]   pitching my company rise, I was getting rejected by every
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.160]   investor that ever took ever took a meeting with me. And you
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   know, I'd started a couple of couple of companies before that
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.240]   too, that didn't do all that well. And then I joined Groupon,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.400]   which had had a little bit of a moment and then and then sort of
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.240]   crashed, as we know, it lost 80% of its market value within a few
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.920]   months. And so I get I get a phone call one day from a
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   conference organizer, and she's like, Hey, would you like to be
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.520]   a keynote speaker at this conference? And I said, that
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.680]   sounds wonderful. What's the name of the conference? And she
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.760]   says, Phil con, which stands for failure conference. And so I'm
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   literally asked to be a keynote speaker for a conference on
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.720]   failure. And I do it. And I didn't realize that there was a
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.280]   reporter from the New York Times in the audience. And fast
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.640]   forward to this full length article on failure, with my, my
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.560]   face as the cover of this article. And I don't know what
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.360]   happened with that TechCrunch article that Lena wrote. But for
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.720]   this man, Chrisman, it was crazy how, how viral it went. And this
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.960]   was like early 2014. And I think failure, like the idea of
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.600]   failure was was just starting to come into the zeitgeist, we were
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.840]   talking about it a lot more, especially in places like
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   Silicon Valley. And so there was a moment where literally, you
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.120]   could have googled the word failure, and my face would have
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000]   been one of your very top search results.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.840]   I have to imagine that was that's not like the the moment
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.040]   you want, like, if you could dictate what your search
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.400]   results are, that's probably not the ideal one. How did that
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.160]   evolve to a place where you're now you ran for Congress, you
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.960]   wrote a book about becoming backable?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.440]   Yeah, you know, a good friend of mine gave me a piece of advice.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   And never forget it. And this is going to sound very sort of
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.880]   Buddhism focused. But you know, the parable that he shared with
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.720]   me is that when you feel pain in life, you feel embarrassment,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.440]   there are two arrows that are fired. One is the arrow that
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.320]   punctures your skin, right? It's the it's the arrow that actually
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.880]   causes you the pain. And, and there's not much you can really
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.040]   do about that arrow. But the second arrow is, is the meaning
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.920]   that you ascribe to that pain, right? What do you actually do
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.040]   with it? And for me, you know, I was I was embarrassed by all
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.680]   this. And yeah, I thought to myself, gosh, I've spent all
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.280]   this time trying to establish myself as this sort of face of
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.240]   success. And now every time somebody Googles my name,
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.560]   failure, a list of my failures is going to be the first thing
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.720]   they see. But you know, what I decided to do with it is I
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.000]   started reaching out to all these people who I admired from
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.760]   celebrity chefs to Oscar winning filmmakers to leaders of big
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.920]   iconic companies. And I would I would basically write in the
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.440]   email, hey, as you can see from this link from this article, I
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.280]   have no idea what I'm doing. But would you be willing to grab
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.400]   some time with me? Would you be willing to give me some advice?
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   And I was just astonished by how many people said yes, I will I
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.400]   will spend some time with you. And I was also astonished by I
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.480]   think people's willingness to talk about their failure,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.280]   especially in these private conversations. Because when you
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.880]   look at their bio, you look at their LinkedIn, you're not
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.000]   you're not seeing that side of the story, you're not seeing all
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.920]   the misses, you're just seeing all the wins. And so a couple of
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.560]   things really occurred to me during that conversation. Number
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.200]   one, we don't rewind the clock enough, and see how failure
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.960]   wasn't necessarily the opposite of success. But failure was a
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   pathway to success for most of the people that we find to be
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   successful. But the second thing is that people who change
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.480]   things, they didn't just learn how to cultivate a new idea,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.240]   they learn how to sell a new idea, they learn how to make
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.720]   themselves backable. And that was a key thing that continued
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.160]   to come up over and over again, because you can have a brilliant
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.080]   idea, and you can still be dismissed. And that happens all
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.760]   of the time. And sometimes the paradox, the trick of it is that
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.840]   sometimes the more unique your idea, the less obvious it is,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.520]   sometimes the harder it is to get people to buy in. And so it
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.200]   puts us in a bit of a weird situation, especially if you are
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.480]   somebody who's trying to create change. And that can be as an
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.280]   entrepreneur that can be inside your own company, which is that
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.880]   oftentimes we are striving to do things that are different. And I
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   haven't talked to a single CEO of a company who isn't like we
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.280]   want to be doing things differently, we want to shake
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.840]   things up. But we rely on different, we need things to be
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.720]   different. And yet, different ideas are also the hardest to
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.040]   sell. And so you have to in some ways, again, not just learn how
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.680]   to come up with these kernels that are going to change things,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.200]   but you also need to learn how to get people to buy into those
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.640]   things.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.800]   And you mentioned a couple examples of people with ideas,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   entrepreneurs, you and I have both been on both sides of that
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.960]   table as investors as founders. But it came to me that this
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.200]   isn't just about learning how to get people to back your startup
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.080]   with dollars, that this could really have lessons outside of
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.480]   that, which apply to anyone.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.000]   I completely agree. You know, I mean, you know, you and I both
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.080]   are fathers now. And I think about sort of what am I telling
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.240]   my kids based on my experience? What am I trying to share with
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.840]   them? And what's the outlook that I want them to have? And I
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.760]   have two daughters. And oftentimes we say to our kids,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.600]   you can do anything you want. Right? That's like the thing
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.880]   that a parent will sometimes say, and I and I catch myself
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.920]   sometimes saying that, but I feel like I knowing what I know
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.160]   now, I feel like I need to be more nuanced about it. It's not
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   you can do anything you want. It's you can do anything you
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.640]   want. But remember that no one ever does it alone. Right? No,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.800]   no successful product project, political movement, career
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.880]   trajectory that was successful ever happened through one person
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.720]   just saying, I'm going to go do that and doing it alone. It was
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.920]   always the people along the way, that invested in you that hired
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.640]   you that took a chance on you in some way, shape or form. And
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.120]   yeah, that could be an investor for your startup. But it could
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.000]   be a hiring manager who says you don't meet all the
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.360]   qualifications of this role. But But I like your energy, and I'm
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.640]   going to take a chance on you. It could even be friends and
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.200]   family, no matter what we're trying to do. And in our
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.800]   communities and our careers and our companies, we always need to
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.400]   have those people taking a leap of faith on us. And so how do
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.160]   you do that?
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.080]   Yeah, that's awesome. And if you think about people who just
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.720]   have jobs, they're not looking to get a new job. Are there some
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.360]   examples of how you can use these kind of back ability
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   traits to get things done at work?
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.680]   Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I know you had Tim Ferriss on the
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.760]   show a few weeks ago. And one of the most important things that I
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.080]   think sort of surfaced in the book was was what I call casting
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.400]   a central character, casting a central character. And the way
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.320]   that this came up for me was when I was when I was actually
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.280]   pitching my idea, though, I think that this is this is
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.840]   something that can be, you know, used inside companies as well.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.880]   But I was pitching Tim on my startup rise. And what rise did
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.360]   was one on one nutrition coaching. And I had all of the
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.160]   sort of I had the classic, like Silicon Valley pitch deck,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.760]   right? It was like, all the numbers, all the sort of trend
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.720]   lines, you know, I talked about the rising rates of obesity and
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.200]   hypertension and diabetes, and, and how big this market was
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.960]   going to be. And then literally during like, q&a, Tim and I
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.800]   started talking, and the story of my father came up. And the
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.760]   story of my father is that when my dad was in his early 40s, he
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.960]   had he had a triple bypass surgery emergency, he was rushed
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.920]   to the hospital, he almost lost his life. I mean, it was it was
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.280]   it was a really close call. And what I remembered most about the
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.840]   experience and what I was sharing with Tim was that when
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   we went to go pick him up, and brought him home, they had given
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.880]   us a folder of paperwork. And I remember sitting in the backseat
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.040]   of the car, I was nine years old, I'm flipping through this
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.200]   paperwork. And one of the pieces of paper was how to eat, right?
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.240]   And then they had things like eat broccoli, eat Brussels
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.360]   sprouts. And I remember thinking to myself, like, we don't, we
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.280]   don't eat broccoli, we don't eat Brussels sprouts, like we're
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.640]   Indian. Like we eat Indian food at home, right? That's not just
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.040]   not part of our diet. And I remember thinking to myself,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.480]   like, I don't think this is really going to stick for my dad.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.160]   And it didn't, like he wasn't abused back in the hospital
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.280]   within 60 days. And so it was when we went back to the
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.320]   hospital that they gave us the help of a nutritionist,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.240]   insurance kicked in help pay for the cost. And I believe that
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.040]   my dad is alive today, over 25 years later, because of the help
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.600]   of that, of that nutritionist, because she was able to
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.720]   customize something that was able to make, you know, it
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.920]   really stick and work for our lifestyle for who we are and
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.720]   how we ate. And so I remember telling Tim that story. And he
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.520]   looks at me and he's like, why wasn't that part of the pitch?
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.160]   Like, why was that? Why was that like a footnote in all of
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.800]   this? And what I realized is that oftentimes, when we walk
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.080]   into a meeting, or we're trying to persuade people, we come in
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.480]   with the numbers. And that's especially true, I think, in
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.040]   places like, you know, Silicon Valley or New York, when we can
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.760]   be incredibly numbers driven. But sometimes we miss the story,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.000]   the story of that one, that one, one person, right. And what we
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   found when we looked at the most successful pitches, both for
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.680]   startups, or inside companies, what people tend to do is they
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.360]   tend to take us into the into the shoes of that one person
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.160]   that they're trying to serve, right, and then they zoom out
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.480]   and talk about the millions of people who are sharing that one
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.520]   person's story. So in the case of rise, in case of my company,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.160]   I would walk in and tell the story of my dad, right, I would
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.640]   tell them I would tell investors that story. And then I would
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   talk about the millions of people who are going through
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.360]   their own version of that same story, central character,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.040]   casting one central character, and marrying story with
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.400]   substance is, I think, one of the keys of a backable person
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.160]   like stories bring us in, but substance keeps us there.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.280]   And so is that something that applies more throughout? Do you
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.360]   start with the story? Do you have the story embedded
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.000]   throughout everything you're talking about? Is it more the
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.240]   narrative? How do you how do you actually apply that?
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.720]   Yeah, I think you can try different, I think you can try
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.520]   different ways. And there's not a fixed formula as to sequence,
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.160]   I don't think the story necessarily needs to come first.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.000]   I personally do. I like the idea of walking into a room and
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.560]   saying, like, let me let me introduce you to this one
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.080]   person, right? And let let me bring you in in that way. And
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   then let's talk about the substance. Let's talk about all
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.360]   the numbers that support all of this. And I think that that
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.120]   tends to be the way that that most I think successful pitches
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.520]   go. I mean, even if you just look at like, let's let's zoom
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.280]   out of startup world for a moment and just look at like
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.640]   journalism, right? Like a great story that's written, a
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.200]   journalist that wants to bring light to what's happening in a
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.040]   certain part of the world, what they'll typically do is they'll
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.480]   start with one person's story, right? This so and so, they'll
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.880]   put you right there. And then they'll zoom out and they'll
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.240]   talk about the how the magnitude of the story, right? Like, it's
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.440]   not just this one person, but how many people are suffering
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.400]   from the same thing. I think it's a very powerful way to I
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.960]   think, start with story and then roll into substance. But you
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.040]   can try it both ways, you can start with the data and the
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.920]   numbers, and then you can tell a story too. But I think the key
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.880]   is that you do both, right? Great story. Like, I think we
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.440]   talk a lot about storytelling in the world of business today.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.520]   And it's become kind of an in vogue sort of term, but
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.160]   storytelling in business isn't isn't sort of getting up in
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.840]   front of a room and saying once upon a time, it's it's it's
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.000]   story plus substance, you need both.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.240]   Yeah. And we're talking about an example where you're already
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.720]   ready to tell your story. What happens before that? How do you
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.520]   I know, the first step in the book was to convince yourself.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.840]   And I think you mentioned something that I thought was
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.880]   really surprising, which is, you know, you think about someone
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.360]   in your mind, who's kind of falls into this criteria of
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.720]   backable. And I think charisma is something you think of, and
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.600]   you pointed out that conviction is really more important than
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.800]   charisma. So yeah, where did you kind of come to that
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.040]   conclusion? And how do you apply it?
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.760]   Yeah, because when I first started writing the book, I
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.280]   thought that I was going to find a certain style to backable
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.640]   people, like they were all going to speak with, you know, great
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.440]   enunciation, they were going to have great hand gestures and
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.560]   pacing and eye contact, and just all like the classic
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.960]   communication things that we learn. And, you know, a Toast
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.680]   Masters or a Dale Carnegie, but that just did that that wasn't
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.040]   the case at all. What I found was that there were certainly
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.080]   some people who were highly charismatic, that were backable,
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.560]   but there were plenty who were not. And, you know, if you want
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.080]   just a quick example of that to go back and watch the original
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.000]   iPhone launch, right, 2007. And we remember that as as a as an
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.240]   epic, epic speech, and it was it Don't get me wrong. But if you
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.920]   look at Steve Jobs communication style, it's not it's not the
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.800]   poster child charisma. He uses the word, uh, over 80 times in
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.520]   the speech, he spends a good deal of time sort of staring at
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.080]   his feet. Like he does a lot of the things that if you were to
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.720]   go see a public speaking coach, they would tell you never to do
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.520]   but it was it was an incredible, incredible presentation
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.320]   to change the world. And there are plenty and plenty of
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.760]   examples of that. What I found is that backable people, it's
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.720]   not charisma that I think makes a person backable. It's
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.640]   conviction backable people. The common denominator is that they
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.720]   take the time to convince themselves first. And then they
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.000]   let that conviction shine through with whatever speaking
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.640]   style it is that feels most natural to them. So I mean, if
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.360]   you're a charismatic person, naturally, don't change that.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.600]   But if you're but if you're not like you're more, you're more
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.560]   shy, or you don't have some of these classic techniques, what
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.120]   I would say to you is don't spend your time trying to
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.640]   develop those techniques. Instead, go to go to the
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.280]   conviction that you have in the idea. And so one of the
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.720]   mistakes that we see sometimes is that people will spend a lot
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.400]   of time creating very slick, you know, sophisticated
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.760]   PowerPoint decks, or keynote decks for their meetings, right,
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.240]   they'll come up with an idea, and they'll immediately go to
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.040]   the design and to the aesthetic of how they're going to present
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.760]   it. But they don't spend enough time actually thinking about
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.040]   like, why do I believe this is true? Like, what are the what
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.640]   are the potential holes in my thinking? What answers do I
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.520]   potentially have for those holes? And again, what we're
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.840]   talking about here, again, whether you're your startup, or
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.560]   you're talking about inside a company, these are new ideas.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.920]   And so every new idea is going to have holes, and it's okay to
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.600]   have that. But spending the time to understand why you're
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.360]   convinced, and also knowing what you don't know, is you're
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.640]   going to be much better off spending your time doing that
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.560]   than creating a PowerPoint deck with a bunch of bullets, but
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.960]   then getting into a room and not really having the substance
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.920]   underneath those bullets.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.720]   And what do you say to someone who's, you know, maybe on one
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.280]   end of the spectrum, where they have ideas, and they're really
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   good at picking them apart, and kind of ultimately abandoning
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.840]   them. And I think that kind of is me, I think part of working
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.680]   in venture capital is saying no 1000 times. And so every time I
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.880]   have something I want to do, one option is just like, wait, and
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.600]   if you're still really excited about it for, you know, three
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.720]   days, five days, 10 days, keep going. But I feel like I've
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.480]   probably had ideas that I picked apart too much and didn't build
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.280]   the conviction in.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.960]   Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, I think that that's definitely the
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.880]   paradox of being smart in a particular area, right? As an
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.000]   investor, you started to see the holes and ideas, and then you
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.720]   apply that to yourself. I was talking to an investor the other
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.160]   day, who was like, he comes from a fintech background. And he's
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.240]   like, I've, I've passed on every single great fintech deal every
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   single one, right? Because I just knew too much. And and so I
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.960]   do think that sometimes we can be sort of, I think, more
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.400]   rigorous on ourselves than others might be, which is why I
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.320]   think that it is important to to get out there and get feedback
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.760]   from other people. Right? And I think that I think that for you,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.640]   I mean, you know, look, look at how look at how far this podcast
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.240]   has come, right? And where you are right now, I think that
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.040]   potentially back in the day, when you were thinking about
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.800]   starting is right, one of the things that might have been on
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.360]   your mind is like, why does the world need another podcast?
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.520]   Right? And you definitely could have gone down the path of like
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.440]   looking at the numbers and saying, like, why is this
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.920]   different and all that, and maybe you would have abandoned
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.880]   the idea. But my guess is that you probably started talking to
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.200]   some folks, and they said, yeah, like, this is this is pretty
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.760]   good. And so I think it's a combination of a couple of
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.800]   things. I think number one is, I think number one is is starting
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.680]   to build what we call in the book, this backable circle of
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.400]   people who are around you. And we can talk a little more about
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.040]   that there are four different types of personalities that we
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.920]   found that people have in this backable circle that they could
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.520]   they could always go to. And and the and I call those the four
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.080]   C's. So the first C is your collaborator. And that's the
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.960]   person who in your case, when you have we have a podcast,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.320]   you're like, look, I this is my podcast idea. And this is
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.080]   somebody who's going to build on top of it. And they're going to
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.400]   be like, yeah, what about this? And they're using language like
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.640]   yes, and then you almost feel like you're in a musical jam
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.000]   session with them. This the second is your is your
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.960]   cheerleader. And it sounds a little sappy, but we all kind
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.920]   of need that cheerleader in our lives, right? It's somebody who
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.200]   can, who can, I think, give us that bit of juice that we need.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.160]   Even if even if it's not a perfect idea, they're kind of
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.400]   like, you know, look, you're going to be able to you're going
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.600]   to be able to figure it out. And what we found is that people,
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.840]   people who are, I think, the most backable, extraordinary
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.320]   people, they all have cheerleaders in their corner.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.040]   The third is your coach. And your coach is different than
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.680]   your collaborator, because your collaborator, while your
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.240]   collaborators thinking about whether your idea is going to
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.520]   fit the market, or fit the company that you're in, or fit
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.000]   the team, your coach is really thinking about like, does this
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.960]   idea fit you? Right? Is this something that you are going to
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.120]   want to run with? And it kind of gets your question, Chris,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.200]   which is like, I don't think any new idea is going to is going
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.240]   to be without holes. Like if it if it if it didn't have holes,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.320]   it probably wouldn't be a new idea. But, you know, the
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.160]   question is, do you do you have enough emotional juice to get
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.760]   through the rejections to get through all the setbacks that
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.560]   are inevitably come up along the way, right? And you're only
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.720]   going to do that if if the idea makes you come alive. One of
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.400]   the things that a good coach does is they know us intimately
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.200]   well enough to say, yeah, this is something that you're going
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.480]   to want to run with and keep getting back up every time you
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.960]   get knocked down, because you love this, like, this is what
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.600]   you do, right? Like, for me, as a writer, I love I love to
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.200]   write. But when I went when I when I went to my wife, and I
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.400]   was like, Look, I've got ideas for these books. She wasn't
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.520]   like, hey, all these ideas are like home runs. But what she
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.920]   said is like, I know that you love to write, like this stuff
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.240]   makes you come alive. And no matter what happens, like you're
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.560]   gonna, you're gonna like want to fight through that. And you
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   need a coach who knows you intimately well enough to be
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.320]   able to do that. And the fourth, the fourth C is your critic.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.960]   But I like to call this your, your cheddar. And I call this
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.360]   person to cheddar, because if you've ever seen the movie
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.040]   eight mile, M&M is surrounded by a circle of friends in the
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.800]   movie. And they're all kind of building him up. But there's
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.240]   one friend named cheddar, who's constantly poking holes and
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.040]   M&M's ideas. And, you know, we find throughout the film is
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   that it's really cheddar, that gets M&M ready for the stage.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.440]   And and I think it's the most underrated member of our circle
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.600]   because we tend to sort of push the cheddars out of our lives,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.400]   right? They can be kind of annoying. No one likes there. No
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.960]   one likes people who poke holes in their ideas. But what we
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.160]   found is that backable people tend to embrace their cheddar
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   because they really find that it's cheddar who's going to
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.880]   bring them, you know, get them ready for a big moment.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.600]   I mean, it's funny, as you walk through this example, I think of
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.480]   my wife, who's probably like the I was like, Oh, yeah, she's the
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.680]   collab. Oh, no, she's that. Oh, she's the coach. Yeah. Can can
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.600]   the same person fill multiple roles? Or Yeah, do you need four
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.800]   distinct people?
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.600]   Now, the same person can fill multiple roles. But I think the
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.440]   key is, you want to be clear with people about what it is you
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.240]   need before before you go in and talk to them. So if you're
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.680]   about to go give a pitch, or if you're about to go to a big
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.840]   meeting, you don't need cheddar moments before that, right?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.320]   That's the last thing that you need. In that moment, you need
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.040]   a cheerleader, maybe you need a little bit of a collaborator.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.320]   So the key is that if you have one person who can play multiple
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.440]   roles, you say to them, look, all right, you know, let's take
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.800]   a reverse example, you're early early on an idea, right? And
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.920]   you're trying to get you're trying to become aware of what
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.000]   are all the blind spots of the idea? Well, then you call
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.480]   friends that look, I need you to be a critic right now, I need
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.600]   you to be a cheddar. But if your moments before that big
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.360]   moment, you want to call somebody and say, I need a
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.680]   cheerleader right now. And so just be very clear with people
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.400]   about what you need.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.880]   Yeah, I'll go and say this actually applies to so many
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.520]   things. I, as many people listening, know, I have a
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.560]   newsletter. And I remember the first time I asked my wife for
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.480]   feedback, I said, Hey, can you give me feedback on this
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.120]   newsletter? So I sent it to her, and she comes back. And there's
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.240]   all these comments about all the grammatical mistakes I made.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.000]   And I was like, Hey, I really appreciate you helping me
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.600]   because I made a bunch of typos and edits and all that. But I
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.560]   really just wanted to know if it was a good idea to write about
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.160]   this topic. And so I you could take that lesson and apply it
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   far beyond just ideas that become backable and that
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.120]   whatnot.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.320]   Totally, totally. Yeah, no, I mean, same same thing happens to
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.440]   me, by the way, I had to be like, I'm working on a new book
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.640]   right now. And it's very, very rough. We're like in rough
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.600]   shape stage right now. I'm writing very, very shitty first
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.640]   drafts. And so I'll tell my wife, I'm like, and she's a
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.560]   writer, as you know, and she'll say, I'll say to her, look,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.120]   skip all the stylistic stuff. Like, don't like don't even
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.600]   touch that. Just like tell me like, does this thing flow?
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.520]   Does this thing even make sense at all?
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.800]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.720]   it. Life comes at you fast. But trust me, your friends are
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.200]   probably desperate for a good hang. So kick 2024 off right by
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.480]   finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the easy
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.160]   way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for drink
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.200]   delivery, take care of the supplies. All you need to come
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.080]   up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.880]   to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.080]   sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.280]   you got through another week. With Drizzly, you can make
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.880]   hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.680]   means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.880]   without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.920]   deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.200]   beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So when I
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.520]   really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.720]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.400]   delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.920]   my local liquor store. So whatever the occasion, download
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.840]   the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com

[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.640]   cause headaches, cramps, fatigue, brain fog, and
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.400]   weakness? Well, our sponsor today, Element, helps anyone

[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.800]   I know there are a few other things that you highlight in the
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.840]   book, but before we get there, I want to jump back to how you
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.920]   learned all of this. So yes, you reached out to all these
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.880]   people. I'm not even sure if you were thinking about writing a
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.440]   book at the time, but what kinds of people wrote back and what
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.480]   were kind of some of the lessons that were themes amongst
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.320]   everyone? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I started to put it into practice
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.160]   myself immediately. And I naturally am just a, I'm a
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.840]   note-taker. And, you know, I tend to sort of take, you know,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.080]   when I'm in a meeting with anybody who I'm learning from, I
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.120]   just take copious notes and I'm pretty disciplined about that.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   And I would, I would leave every single one of these meetings.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   And it was a broad range of people. It was military
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.440]   leaders. It was, it was celebrity chefs. It was, it was
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.320]   people who were producing films. It was a lot of people
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.960]   inside Silicon Valley who were on both sides of the table,
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.440]   founders who had done well and investors who invested in
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.280]   founders. And so I was taking my notes and I was compiling
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.320]   them. And I was starting to realize that, A, I really loved
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.720]   having these conversations and wanted to have more of them.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.760]   And so I did, I just continued to do that. But B, as I was
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.720]   putting these things into practice, like it was working,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.400]   it was working for me. And I started to share some of the
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.320]   nuggets and some of the wisdom that I was getting in these
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.560]   conversations with other people, people who are starting
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.120]   companies, people who are inside companies that were
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.240]   trying to get their ideas made, and it was working for them
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.760]   too. And so I, I, it took a while. I mean, I, I started
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.480]   this process in 2014. I didn't start writing the book until
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.240]   2017 and the book didn't come out until 2021. And so it's
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.120]   been a long time in the making. The theme, the way that I
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.640]   sort of themed the book was I really tried to put a tight
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.600]   filter on like the obviousness. Like there were a lot of
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.160]   obvious things that came out of these conversations too,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.320]   right? You need to do your research. You need to be
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.040]   prepared. Like there are all the sort of obvious things,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.000]   but I tried to just filter all that out because we already
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.800]   know that. And I tried to really search for what was not
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   obvious. Convincing yourself first to me, even though now I
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.880]   look at it and I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. It was one
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.200]   of those things I never really, I never really did. And I
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.680]   noticed that a lot of other people didn't either really
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.920]   taking the time to build that conviction. And, you know, in
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.360]   the book, we go through very specific things that people do
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.400]   to actually build conviction. You know, one of the, one of
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.240]   the, one of the things that I, one of the other themes that
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.720]   came out of the book was this idea of playing exhibition
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.840]   matches, playing exhibition matches, which I thought was, I
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.720]   think I still think today is, is a really, really important
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.160]   one, which is like, you know, when we studied backable
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.760]   people, one of the things we found was that they tend to
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.080]   almost have this improvisational style about them, right? Like
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.440]   when they speak, it's almost like they're speaking like
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.920]   they're off the cuff. But the reality is that that actually
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.240]   is the product of lots and lots and lots of practice, right?
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.840]   And in fact, the average backable person that we studied
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   was practicing about 21 times before they got into a big
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.840]   moment. So with any type of new content, any type of new
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.160]   presentation, new idea, it was 21 practice rounds before they,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.440]   before they got into the real thing. Now, like a couple of
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   things to keep in mind. Number one is like these practice
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.320]   rounds can be with anybody, you know, like Chris, I'm sure
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.400]   like your wife would be on that list. Mine, mine would be on
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.880]   mine, right? My daughter, my daughter, my nine-year-old
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.440]   daughter will, will do an exhibition match with me every
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.680]   once in a while, right? I just need somebody to kind of
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.800]   listen. And it's really important to, I think, do this
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.160]   over and over again. Now, the number one, the number 21
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.680]   might seem like a lot because it did to me. And I thought to
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.640]   myself, like, isn't that going to make you sound really
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.360]   scripted? Isn't it going to make you sound like robotic if
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.640]   you practice something that much? But what I found is that
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.440]   the opposite happens because once you've actually mastered
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.360]   material at that level, when you sort of understand what
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.800]   you're talking about it, that in that way, what it allows you
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.680]   to do is it allows you to drop your script when you walk
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.120]   inside a room, right? You, you no longer are sort of married
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.040]   to the outline where you're like, yeah, I'm going to say
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.960]   this, and I'm going to say that, and I'm going to say that,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.200]   which is, it tends to be how most presentations are sort of
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.360]   given very linearly. When you have mastered your material at
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.040]   that level, what it allows you to do is be fully tuned in,
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.160]   fully present and adaptive to what's happening inside the
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.400]   room. If something's resonating a little more, you can
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.640]   double-click on that. If you find that there's a look of
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.880]   confusion on that person's face, well, then you can take
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.440]   the pause at the right moments and you can start to adapt and
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.880]   you can start to flow. And what we find is that backable
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.000]   moments never really happen when somebody walks into a
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.040]   room and, and like reads a script and then like drops the
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.440]   mic and leaves like that doesn't happen, right? It's a
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.720]   series of interactions. It's a back and forth. It's a, it's
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.840]   pausing, it's jumping around where these like really
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.600]   productive meetings tend to happen. And so mastering your
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.840]   material at that level allows you to have that kind of
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.640]   flexibility and fluidity. Uh, one of my favorite quotes from
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.760]   the book is Charlie Parker, who's this great, who's great
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.520]   jazz musician. And, and he had just, not only was he just a
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.720]   great, great musically, but he had this incredible stage
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.400]   presence to him. And so one day somebody asked him, they said,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.800]   they say, Charlie, like, how do you have such incredible
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.360]   presence on stage? And Charlie Parker says, well, you got to
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.440]   learn your instrument and then you practice, practice,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.120]   practice. And then before you get up on stage, you forget all
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.600]   of that and you just wail. Right. And what we're really
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.800]   trying to do, Chris, I think is we're trying to get to that
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.600]   point where we feel confident, kind of just forgetting it,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.080]   like forgetting all the stuff that we had been, where we
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.480]   committed to memory and just like going in there and just
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.760]   being able to wail. Right. And it, the only way we get there
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.360]   is through lots of practice. Yeah. Two things that come from
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.000]   this that, that I'll share. One, I always, if you look at a
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.440]   slide deck of any presentation I've ever given, a stark
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.800]   contrast to many others is that I try to put almost nothing on
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.200]   the slides, right? It's, it's an image or a word or maybe
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.160]   three words or, or something, but I don't have a lot of
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.840]   bullets and I've never really been able to articulate why. I
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.520]   always see people's presentations and I'm just like,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.400]   cut it out, cut it out, put small things. But now I feel
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.120]   like I can actually articulate it based on what you said,
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.640]   which is, if you know the content well enough and you
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.480]   want to read the room to, you can't have a script sitting
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.520]   behind you or you're kind of forced into a specific
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.280]   conversation. And so when you drop a lot of that, it gives
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.600]   you the flexibility to go wherever you want. Yeah. But it
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.160]   at least hones you to say, I'm still going to make this one
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.000]   macro point, but I can make it in whatever way I want. So I
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.880]   appreciate you sharing that because I now, I now could
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.400]   articulate why I do this thing I do. Well, I'll add to that
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.840]   too. Cause I, I, I, I, I love that. And part of the, one of
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.080]   the things that I think that, you know, back will people
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.560]   like yourself tend to do is that they tend to share what
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.960]   something could be, but not exactly how it has to be. They
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.360]   share what it could be and not exactly how it has to be. And
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.320]   so by having sort of a high level theme, what you're, what
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.560]   you're inviting is a discussion as well. And it may be that off
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.520]   that one sort of meta bullet that you have on that, on that
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.320]   slide, instead of the seven bullets, what you're going to
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.760]   do is you're going to prompt the room to start, to start
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   contributing to the conversation. And that, and
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.880]   that's when just like the best things happen. One of the
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.480]   chapters in the book is called flip outsiders into insiders,
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.600]   flip outsiders and insiders, right? You want people to
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.720]   ultimately feel like they're an insider in your idea. That's,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.720]   that's when people get interested. That's when they
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.800]   get excited. You know, Salman Rushdie, who's one of my
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.520]   favorite authors had this quote, and he said that most of
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.040]   the decisions that happen in our lives, most of the
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.720]   decisions that affect us happen when we're not even in the
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.840]   room. Right. And I love that because it's so, it's so true,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.600]   right? You go in and give a pitch. Like you were on the
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.000]   investing side, right? At Google ventures, when people
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.360]   came in and pitched you, even if you love the idea, your next
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.400]   step was to go talk to other people at GV, right? You had,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.800]   you had to start representing the idea. So now all of a
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.520]   sudden, this, the outcome for this founder is somewhat in
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.760]   your hands, right? They're not in the room anymore. You're
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.720]   the one representing their idea. And the point is that
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.400]   oftentimes we sort of treat these situations as we're
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.120]   trying to sell that person, almost expecting like that's
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.760]   the final outcome. But no, we're not just looking to
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.720]   create people who like our idea. We're trying to try to
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.280]   create people who advocate for our ideas, right? They have
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.200]   to go out and they have to sell their other people at the
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.240]   cell, their partners or their fellow colleagues or other
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.040]   members of the leadership team or whatever, whatever it is.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.240]   And we can only do that if they feel like they are, they
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.200]   have almost founder level passion over the idea, even if
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.560]   they didn't come up with it themselves.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.680]   Yeah, I love that. And it's something that if I look back
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.880]   fundraising, I tried to do, but I'm not sure I, I did it as
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.760]   well as I would if I tried again, I want to go back really
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.520]   quickly and just point, point out something that I know you
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.760]   kind of conveyed, but you didn't title one of the
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.280]   chapters, you need to do some research and prepare for
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.960]   meetings. It was play exhibition matches. And what I
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.920]   took away from that, that was maybe subtle, but also
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   important is that the type of preparation that you should be
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.760]   doing is very similar to the type of action you're going to
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.240]   have. So if you're giving a presentation, give the
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.680]   presentation. Yeah. And that is different than reading the
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.480]   slides. That's different from writing out the notes and
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.360]   practicing the notes. So I just wanted to highlight and unless
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.880]   I got it wrong, that it's really important to match that
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.560]   medium, and not just prepare, but actually do the thing
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.120]   you're going to do.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.480]   Yeah, yeah, it's such a good, such a, I mean, I'm glad you
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.880]   brought it up. Because like, sometimes I forget how
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.640]   important this is. And it was impressed upon me many times
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.160]   from all the people that we studied, which is like, don't
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.560]   give the directors commentary when you're doing these
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.480]   exhibition matches. When you're when you're giving these
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.920]   practice sessions, give it as if you're in the actual room,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.000]   right? So you're not saying, hey, so here's what I'm
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.680]   planning on doing, I'm going to say this to them. And I'm
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.840]   going to say that to them, you're just giving the actual
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.800]   thing, because what you're doing is you're building the
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.480]   muscle memory that you're going to need when you're inside the
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.880]   real the real situation. When I was studying for the GMAT, I
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.280]   still remember my I was speaking and talking to my older
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.800]   brother, who's like a whiz at at like the standardized tests.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.880]   And I was like, dude, how do you do this? I suck at
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.520]   standardized tests. What do I what do I need to do? And he's
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.560]   like, Listen, what time is the test that you're taking? And I
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.160]   was like, I was like, at 3pm. He's like, all right, every day
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.040]   from here until the test at 3pm. You take a practice test
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.440]   every single day. Right. And I, I never would have done that.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.720]   Like, I never would have done that. I mean, it elevated my
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.880]   game. I mean, it was the best. It was the best standardized
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.760]   test I've ever taken, like it did way better than I thought I
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.680]   was going to. And it was only because every day at 3pm, I took
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.320]   that test. And so like applying that to like the world that
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.400]   we're in, if you are, if you have a big meeting coming up
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.320]   with the leadership team, or you're pitching investors,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.840]   whatever it is, right? What time is that meeting? Is it at 11am?
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.040]   Well, then 11am, start giving these exhibition matches start
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.400]   doing these practice sessions, like give a practice round every
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.360]   day at 11am between here and there. And you start conditioning
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.640]   your mind, you start getting it ready for the for the real
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.520]   moment. And again, like what you said, you want to do the you
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.680]   want to do the real thing. The other thing that I that I
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:09.760]   completely sort of I, I am terrible at doing is like, I
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   always ask the question after I give a practice session to
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.000]   somebody, I always ask them the question. What did you think?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.800]   Like, what did you think of that? Right? And what I
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.720]   realized is that backable people never asked that question.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.560]   Because it's just it's such a low signal question to ask,
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.960]   you're not going to get the feedback that you need. Because
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.400]   typically, if you ask somebody like, what'd you think? They're
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   gonna be like, yeah, it was pretty good. You know, like,
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.040]   yeah, I liked it. And that doesn't really give you the
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.520]   information that you need to be better. And so especially if
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.480]   you're talking to somebody who is informed, the better
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.880]   question to ask is, what part of all that stood out to you the
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.560]   most? Right? Because now, now they actually have to put some
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.440]   thought into like, they have to stack rank, like, here's what
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.320]   the best stuff was. And it may turn out that like some of the
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.720]   stuff that you wanted to be the best, the point that you were
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.440]   really trying to make, didn't actually make that cut. And
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.720]   that's really good information to have. Or the other great
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.000]   question that I love to ask now is how would you describe this
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.040]   idea to someone else? Right? And something that I do now is as I
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.360]   especially was thinking about new book topics, and I sort of
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.120]   have my, you know, two page proposal, proposal written is I
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.840]   would hand it to somebody and I'd say, can you read this? And
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.600]   then they'd be like, yeah, it's pretty good. And I'd be like,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.160]   how would you describe this idea to a friend? Right? And what
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.760]   I found is that oftentimes, some of my friends would describe
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.800]   my idea in a way that was much better than than I ever could.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.120]   And that ended up being the way that ended up framing the book.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.640]   Yeah. Is there a question that you can ask to find some of the
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.440]   stuff that's not good? Right? I think that that helps you
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.120]   rephrase and highlight what what worked. And I'm asking
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.080]   specifically, because I usually ask guests at the end of this,
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.200]   after we stop the recording, I say, I want to know what I could
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.720]   have done to do a better interview. And, you know, I
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.960]   sometimes ask, like, is there a question I should have asked? Or
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.080]   what question did I ask that really stood out those things?
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.560]   But I'm like, what could I have done better? Like, what did I do
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.000]   wrong? It's like, I'm always craving. What did I do wrong
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.800]   that I could do better? Yeah, well, I mean, I love it. I love
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.120]   that you do that. I mean, one of the things that really impressed
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.400]   me this, this answer your question is, like, when we were
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.680]   selling rise, so rise to a company called one medical. And
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.480]   one of the things that really impressed me from the beginning
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.080]   about one medical and the founder, a guy named Dr. Tom Lee,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.920]   was that he had sort of run his brick and mortar, you know,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.440]   business in the very beginning, it was like, literally just him
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.720]   inside a clinic. And he was serving every role. He was the
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.600]   doctor, he was the nurse, he was the phlebotomist, he was the
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.240]   front desk, he was everything. But one of the things that he
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.040]   did when he was starting out is every time a patient would leave
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.000]   the experience, he'd say, Hey, look, on a scale of one scale,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.160]   one to 10. Yeah, how would you rate this experience? And if it
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.320]   was anything other than a nine or 10, he would ask, what could
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.760]   I have done that would have made this a nine or 10? Right? And I
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.520]   think that that's just a very positive sort of way, I think to
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.200]   ask that question. But what was really cool about his story is
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.640]   like, because he was serving all roles, he would literally take
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.360]   that feedback, and he'd roll it right into the next patient
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.400]   visit. So he had this just like, you know, almost like product
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.840]   development iteration style clinic that he was running. And
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.320]   he continued to sort of fold this feedback in over and over
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.280]   and over again, until he finally refined this process that he
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.080]   felt like was ready, ready to scale. So yeah, I think I think
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.480]   just asking people that what was what would it have taken to
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.440]   make it a nine or 10?
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.120]   Yeah. And that's like, it's so funny. It's a classic thing
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.320]   that yeah, companies do. I'm sure everyone here has gotten a
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.120]   survey after buying a product online and the promoter score
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.160]   it's an NPS score. And it's so crazy. But people don't actually
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.920]   use that same if it's the best question that businesses use to
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.360]   ask, why are we not using it in our personal lives is kind of
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.560]   something interesting.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.040]   How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.160]   Research shows that if you're like 90% of Americans, you most
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.600]   likely have money anxiety. In fact, that is one of the reasons
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.280]   I started a financial planning firm back in 2016. And when we
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.920]   shut the company down, we did extensive research on the
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.320]   financial service company we wanted to recommend to our
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.440]   clients. And we landed on facet and I'm excited they're
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.040]   sponsoring today's episode. facet has turned the financial
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.080]   planning industry on its head, making financial planning
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.600]   accessible to everyone, not just the most wealthy. And one of
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.160]   the things I hated about this industry is that so many
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.960]   financial advisors charge based on a high percentage of your
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.520]   assets, but not facet, they only charge a flat annual membership
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.960]   fee, which means you actually keep more of what you invest.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.640]   And they match you with your own CFP professional who uses
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.920]   industry leading technology and is backed by a team of experts
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.080]   across investments, taxes and more. So tackle the uncertainty
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.880]   you're feeling about your finances and replace it with
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.000]   some real confidence about your money. Go to all the hacks

[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.120]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.240]   Chang about leveling up your cooking at home? If not,
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.200]   definitely go back and give it a listen. But one of his top
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.560]   hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit I was a
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.080]   skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.600]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.080]   to partner with them for this episode. Anyday is glass
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.440]   cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.040]   scratch in the microwave. And honestly, using it feels like a
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.400]   kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.880]   process so much. The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.040]   cook, serve, store, and reheat all in the same dish that

[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.480]   to jump quick back to what you were saying about bringing
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.640]   people in. And I'm curious if you have tactics for bringing
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.240]   people into your idea or your project. I think you've
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.280]   convinced me of how valuable it is, but how do you actually do
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.200]   it? Yeah, I was kind of the person who would, you know, come
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.800]   into an hour-long meeting and I would have like 40 minutes worth
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.640]   of content, right? Like I would have a pretty exhaustive slide
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.760]   deck and then I would use that 40 minutes to sort of like go
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.680]   through it. And then I'd use 20 minutes for Q&A. And what I
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.960]   found is that that tends to kind of be sort of how most of those
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.520]   meetings go, that 40/20 split. And what I now do is I reverse
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.760]   that. I walk in with 20 minutes or less of content, like just
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.240]   very, very high level, and then open it up. Because I think
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.400]   these backable moments happen when you can sort of get people
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   involved, right? And so that means sharing counterintuitively,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.800]   it means sharing less upfront than you might otherwise share,
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.840]   right? It means just really kind of like setting out what the
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.360]   high-level vision is, having a few of the details, but then
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.000]   having the rest be in backup, like be ready, be prepared to
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.480]   have the discussion. You know, one of the misnomers I think
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   that people have is like the misconceptions is that it takes
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.720]   more time to prepare for a presentation than it does to
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.080]   prepare for a productive discussion. That's not true. It
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.000]   actually takes a lot more preparation to prepare for a
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.400]   discussion. Because with a discussion, you have to be able
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.040]   to ask the right questions. You have to be able to pull out the
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.600]   right sets of information. You have to do a lot of research on
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.360]   the other people who are in the room, because you know that
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.200]   they're all bringing certain perspectives in, and you're
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.600]   looking to tap into those perspectives, too. And to sort
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.880]   of bring people in in a certain way and start weaving all that
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.360]   together, I think it takes a higher level of preparation.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.560]   And one of the stories that I really enjoyed was I studied a
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.240]   designer who was remarkably effective inside big companies,
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.520]   companies like Microsoft and Google. And that's hard
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.280]   sometimes as a designer, because you're really trying to
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.720]   steer lots and lots of people. And especially in bigger
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.960]   companies, when there's lots of red tape and lots of decision
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.920]   makers, it can kind of be a frustrating role. But this guy
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.520]   was remarkably effective at it. And I wanted to understand like
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.320]   what was his process? What was it like? And one of the stories
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.360]   that he told me was that when he was starting out, he would
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.960]   always take these really pixel perfect designs into these
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.760]   meetings, and he would present his vision, he put them up on
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.240]   the you put them up on the wall, and people would sort of tear
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.920]   it apart. They'd be like, Well, I don't like that. And I don't
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.360]   like that. And it turned out to be these very unproductive,
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.720]   frustrating meetings for him. But one day, almost by accident,
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.000]   he I mean, he forgot his backpack. And so he didn't have
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.120]   his laptop, but the meeting was already scheduled. And so he
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.680]   literally walks into a room, but he's not able to project
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.720]   these designs because he doesn't have them with him. So instead,
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.080]   he, he literally goes up to the whiteboard. And he begins to
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.320]   draw his design up on the whiteboard. So now instead of
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.640]   pixel perfect colors, he's black and white, right. And what he
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:03.200]   said was that people for the first time ever, like got up out
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.560]   of their seats. They like stood behind stood with him at the
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.680]   whiteboard, they started drawing with him. And he's like, we got
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.240]   more done in that one hour than I had in like the previous few
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.000]   months trying to get this design done. Because like, I was I was
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.640]   I was going to them and I was trying to get their buy in
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.360]   rather than sort of bringing them in. There's a there's a
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:29.200]   classic classic story of Betty Crocker in the 1940s. And in the
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.960]   1940s, Betty Crocker introduced instant cake mix to the market.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.840]   And they were so excited about instant cake mix, because they
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.560]   done all the research, they done all the focus groups, and they
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.400]   felt like this was going to be a hit product. And so they put a
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.760]   ton of marketing dollars behind this, they get instant cake mix
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.400]   on grocery sales all around the country. And then they wait for
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.480]   the sales numbers to come in. And when they do, they're
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.160]   shocked. Because they find they find out that nobody is buying
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.600]   this instant cake mix, and they cannot figure out why. And so
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.400]   they hire the psychologist, a guy by the name of Ernest
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.040]   Dykda to go out into the field and start interviewing
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.880]   customers. And what Dykda comes back with, like is shocking to
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.240]   the people of Betty Crocker, he says, I think you have made the
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.320]   process of making a cake too easy, too simple. Because when
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.520]   a customer removes the cake from the oven, they actually don't
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.160]   feel any ownership over it, they actually don't feel like they
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.600]   actually made the cake. So Dykda is like, I have a
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.320]   recommendation for you, why don't you remove one key
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.760]   ingredient, and just see what happens. And so they do, they
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.440]   remove the egg. So now as a customer, you have to go out,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.600]   you have to buy fresh eggs, you have to bring them back home,
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.680]   you have to crack them into the mix, you have to stir it in,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.400]   and then you pop it into the oven, and sales completely take
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.840]   off. Right? Because now when the cake comes out of the oven,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.280]   customers actually felt some ownership over that over that
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.440]   cake, they felt like they had made it themselves. And look, I
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.000]   mean, this has been this has been proven out over and over
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   again, through different psychological tests. There's a
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.760]   group out of Harvard that calls this the IKEA effect, which
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.480]   basically says that we place up to five times the amount of
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.920]   value on something that we help build than something that we
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.640]   simply buy off the shelf. Because because we made it
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.200]   ourselves. So there's a lot of there's a lot of people out
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.160]   there with poorly made futons and furniture, and they're never
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.480]   going to get rid of it. Because it's like, no, I built this, I
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.160]   made it with my own two hands. And so what does this have
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.120]   anything to do with what we're talking about? I mean, I think
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:28.000]   that we oftentimes come in, and we treat people like buyers,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   instead of builders, right? What people don't want to be buyers,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.800]   people, ultimately, even if their job is to be an investor,
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.440]   job is to be a producer, you know, jobs to green light ideas
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.920]   inside a company, people want to be builders, they actually
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.760]   want to feel like they're they're part of something. And
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.600]   so your job is to figure out a way to turn them from a buyer
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.000]   into a builder. So by the time they leave the room, they
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.760]   actually feel like they have some ownership over this as
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.480]   well, they were able to crack their own egg into the mix.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.680]   Yeah, well, first off, I'll just have to say thank you to
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.000]   Betty Crocker, because I my wife and I love to bake and she's
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.360]   she's much better baker than I but I just don't think you can
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.240]   make a cake as good as cake mix like it's just it always tastes
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.720]   so much better. So first off, just going to give a little
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.920]   thank you there. But I totally love this theme of if you're
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.560]   anything you're doing, whether you're giving a presentation,
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.200]   whether you're building a product, kind of taking a little
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.800]   bit less out of not trying to do the whole thing for the room
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.280]   for the part partner for the buyer and inviting them in. But
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.760]   I'll highlight you said something and I have a tactic to
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.080]   share, but still being prepared for that discussion. So when I
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.400]   was out fundraising, when I was out fundraising for my startup,
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.160]   I had a really short deck. But what I did was I thought of
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.160]   every question that I could possibly get asked. And my
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.400]   co founder, every time someone asked a question that we hadn't
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.920]   thought about wrote it down. And every for the next pitch, we
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.920]   had a slide that addressed every single question. And this
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.560]   wasn't as easy, but I went memorize the order of all the
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.920]   slides. And I did an episode a few weeks ago about memory. If
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.960]   you want to kind of improve that, check that out. And so
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.680]   someone came and would say, this was about financial advice,
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.840]   they'd say, well, how do financial advisors spend their
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.600]   time? And I was like, 32, boom, slides up, answer there, we can
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.240]   have a conversation with data. But I didn't walk them through
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.400]   all the questions because I wanted them to be a part of
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.560]   asking and answering and thinking through whether this
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   was a good idea. And the interesting thing I learned was
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.000]   that if someone asked me a question and said, do people
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.680]   really want to pay for financial advice? And I answered, yes,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.400]   they do. And here's why. They kind of bought it. But if there
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.480]   was a slide that had my answer written on a screen, people were
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.320]   like, they bought the answer more. And all it took was me
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.480]   thinking of every question, writing it up, same answer,
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.600]   there wasn't more data. It was just written as if it was
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.960]   prepared. And by being prepared, it was like, yes, this is
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.600]   certain. This person's not just giving me the answer I want to
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.160]   hear. This was the answer they were going to give no matter
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.760]   what. They're not ad hoc-ing, they're not BS-ing me. And so I
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.320]   always tell people, take that Q&A, and you might not use 75%
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.520]   of the slides, but write up a slide for every question you
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.560]   might get. And it just makes the answer you give people so much
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.040]   stronger.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.600]   Yeah, I love that. I love that. It's great.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.520]   Yeah. It was actually the only use case for the Apple for like
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.400]   a while had this touch bar. And it was like, I could slide
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.960]   through slides and try to find them. But it's a useless
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.560]   product. They got rid of it finally.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.520]   In the conversation of meeting people and trying to bring them
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.520]   in, one of the things I think I and probably many people
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.440]   struggle with is, yeah, if you schedule a meeting, it's really
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.400]   easy to kick off that meeting. But what about when you are at
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.920]   an event, and you see someone, you're like, "This person could
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.400]   add value. I'd love to bring them in. I'd love to bring them
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.280]   in to be an insider in what I'm doing. But I don't know them.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.160]   And I'm walking up to this person." And some people have
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.600]   the ability to walk up to anyone and start a conversation and
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.440]   bring them in. And I know running for Congress, you did
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.800]   this thousands of times, going up to complete strangers and
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.960]   trying to build that rapport really quickly. What advice do
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.600]   you have for someone who's, let's say, at a conference,
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:13.040]   sees someone much more senior than to them, maybe runs another
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.480]   company, very successful, could add a lot of value? How do you
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.760]   walk up and engage that person? What are the backable traits of
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.800]   people that do that? Well,
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.120]   it's a great question, Chris, even after doing it thousands of
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.640]   times, I don't know if I've mastered sort of that I feel
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.840]   like I've never, I've never quite been great at small talk,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.240]   which was which is not great if you're running for political
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.520]   office. But what I would say is that I think that asking good
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:44.960]   questions is is such a such an underappreciated art, right? And
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.400]   I think that one of the things that we tend to do is we tend to
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:53.040]   sort of, you know, we use those precious key moments that we
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.640]   tend to have with somebody kind of just asking the same old
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.840]   stuff sometimes, like, how you doing? Like, how's it going? And
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.960]   I think that there are, I think there are oftentimes, like much
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.560]   more precise things that we can ask people. And I think that
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.840]   anytime that you are interested in getting somebody involved,
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.080]   rather than going out and immediately pitching them, one
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.320]   of the things that I try to do is I try to put myself in
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.600]   information collection mode, right? Like, who, like, what are
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.640]   they? What are they up to these days? How like, what, what's,
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.680]   what are they most interested in? And so one of the I mean,
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.360]   this, this one of the things I try to get from from people is
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.160]   like, you know, hey, what, you know, what, what are some of
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.040]   the things that you feel like are working the best right now?
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.600]   Like, if it's an investor, for example, like, what are some of
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.520]   the things in your portfolio that you're most proud of right
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.320]   now? Right? Like, what do you and potentially even asking,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   like, what, what do you feel like, you know, you thought was
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.360]   going to happen and surprised you, right? What were the
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.080]   biggest surprises this year is a question that I might ask
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.680]   somebody, you know, but I really am trying to use those few
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:00.400]   moments, not to sell myself, but really try to get some signal
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.000]   on who this person is. Right? That's, that's one thing. The
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.720]   second thing I would say is that oftentimes we go in for the
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.120]   kill too quickly. Right? And like, even even like running for
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.080]   office, like, I saw people who were like, I'd love your vote,
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.320]   right? Like I walk up, like, I'm running for office, I'd love
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.920]   your vote. And it's like, it never works. Like, it's like,
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.600]   it's like, it's too soon. And what you want to do is you want
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.800]   to you want to get to know this person? Who are you like, I'm
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.600]   talking to a voter, like, what are the things you care? What do
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.960]   you care most about? What's it? What is going to be the thing
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.640]   that matters most to you when you end up voting in November?
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.840]   Right? And questions like that are questions that let me
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.560]   understand who this person is. And I think that we need to sort
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.600]   of evolve from like going in for the kill tomorrow to think like
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.000]   the one to punch, or it's like the phase one is really learning
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   everything you can about this person. And then phase two is
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.640]   setting up a follow up meeting and saying, you know, I'd love
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.840]   to share this with you. But then the thing that I think is like
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.360]   most important and almost never done is like, as soon as you go
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.960]   home, or like, go off to the side, and like, write down
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.520]   everything that you just learned, right? Like literally
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.880]   plot a plot note, plot a note on your on your phone, and write
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.040]   down like the four or five things that you've learned from
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.520]   that conversation. Because when you go back and talk to that
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.160]   person, you want to make sure that you're that you're you're
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.920]   weaving those into the conversation, like you're
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.040]   reacting and responding to the information that they've given
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:27.540]   you.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.440]   Yeah, I've always get the email. And I don't think I always
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.000]   write the notes down. And three days later, you're like, gosh,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.480]   what were we talking about? I met so many people. So I love
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.760]   the idea of, I leave the email in my draft, but I should go
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.800]   back and just add a few bullets beforehand, even if they're not
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.760]   what I'll actually send.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.520]   I think people, no matter what, at all levels, no matter who
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.680]   they are, I think at the end of the day, we all want to feel
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.440]   heard. Right? We all we all want to feel heard. And it's just
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.600]   so universal. It's so primal. And oftentimes, we just we just
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:00.880]   don't, we don't show people that we might actually even hear
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.760]   them. But we don't actually show them that we heard them, you
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   know, like, the people who I people I studied inside bigger
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.800]   companies that were just amazing, amazing at navigating
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.840]   and like corralling people around them to one of the art
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.000]   forms that they were able to sort of really get down was that
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.960]   even if they disagreed with people, they would always sort
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.640]   of let them know that they had considered their feedback,
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.760]   right? Like, for example, there was an executive that I sort of
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.360]   shadowed, who what she did is she would every time people had
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.560]   feedback for her, she would write it down, right? And then
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.760]   when she was coming back into the follow up meeting, what she
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.040]   would do is she put, she'd start the meeting by putting all that
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.360]   feedback up, right? Like, she would literally project all the
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.920]   feedback. And she'd say, here are all the things that I heard
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.280]   during our last meeting. And here, here's what I ended up
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.400]   doing with that feedback. And it wasn't always like, I respond,
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.640]   I responded to it. And now it's part of the it's part of the
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.760]   new idea. But it was like, no, sometimes I didn't respond to
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.880]   it. But I want you to know that, like, I tracked it, I heard it,
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.360]   like you have been heard. And yeah, it doesn't make people
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.240]   feel 100%. When you've shared an idea, and it's in it, and it
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.840]   wasn't used. But it sure as hell feels a lot better than someone
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.080]   saying, huh, that's interesting, and then doing nothing with it.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.120]   Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I think it goes back to when you email
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.160]   people for advice, and you got such a great response rate.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.800]   Obviously, you know, you kind of got to show this, hey, look,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.600]   the New York Times called me a failure, have some pity on me.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.760]   But I do think the the message that probably worked and and
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.480]   drove people to answer is, you weren't saying, can you do me a
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.520]   favor? You were saying, can you share your your learnings or
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.240]   your I always when I write those emails, ask people to share
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.800]   their wisdom, because I feel like wisdom is like a word
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.680]   that's like, hey, I think you're smart, and I'd love to learn
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.440]   from you. And so I go back and think that that's probably why
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.600]   you saw such a high response rate is because people want to
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.400]   be heard. I think it's I think it's totally right, man. I
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.080]   think that's totally right. And I think people want to share
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.480]   their they want to share their story as well. And I think that
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.560]   if if you're coming across as somebody who doesn't necessarily
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.360]   have an agenda, that's really, that's really, it's really
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.320]   important. I think like, there's a story in the book that I wish
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.960]   like, I could have brought in sooner, right? Because it ended
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.120]   up making the last chapter of the book. And so I feel like
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.840]   sometimes people don't finish books. And so it probably may
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.320]   have gotten lost in the shuffle. But it's a story of a
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.480]   guy named George Schaller. And Schaller was this primatologist
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.400]   who was just amazing at what he did. And part of the reason he
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.240]   was amazing at like his work is that he was able to get closer
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   to mountain gorillas than really anybody else, like the way that
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.080]   he would approach them, they somehow let him in, in a way
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.840]   that they wouldn't let other people in. And so Schaller is at
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.040]   this conference one day, and he's presenting his findings.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.800]   And finally, somebody in the audience gets up and they're
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.360]   like, Listen, Dr. Schaller, I don't get it. Like, why is it
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.920]   that these mountain gorillas are allowing you to get so close?
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:59.040]   And he says, Look, it's simple. I never carry a gun. No matter
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.440]   what, I never carry a weapon. And that confused everybody,
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.240]   because they're like, well, okay, well, all right, we carry
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.560]   weapons, but they're in our backpack. And we're not like
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.960]   waving it around or anything like that. It's like, it's
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.400]   tucked away. It's out of sight. And Schaller's theory was, look,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.200]   you can you can hide your attitude, you know, you can hide
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.240]   a gun, but you can never really hide your attitude around a
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.200]   gun. And if you have it in your backpack, you're always going
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.560]   to behave a little bit differently. And there's that
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.120]   that little bit of difference, that little energetic shift
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   that these gorillas can pick up on, because it's just it's so
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.200]   primal for us. And I think about that a lot. Because oftentimes,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.840]   when I when I find when I catch myself trying to sound smart,
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.040]   or I try to catch myself trying to come off it, like with an
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.680]   agenda, hidden agenda, I realize that like, there's an energy
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.120]   that comes with that. And to become pure about it, like in
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.320]   your case, look, I just really just want to learn from you, I
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.480]   think is why people are responding. And you're getting I
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.960]   think you're getting some really great guests, myself, not
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.280]   included, but some really great guests like Johannes Marlowe,
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.920]   and Tim Ferriss. And it's, it's really been an amazing show.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.040]   Thank you. Yeah, I mean, we covered so I mean, first of
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.440]   all, everyone, there's so much more on each of these in the
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.000]   book. And I actually made it through the whole book. You're
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   welcome. I didn't make it through the through the
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.440]   appendix yet. But yeah, the one thing that we didn't touch on
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.560]   that I had had a question on that I want to jump to. And you
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.480]   shared, it's about finding an earned secret and uncovering
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.960]   the information that that's not obvious that and you just
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.600]   mentioned the questions people don't get asked. And you share
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.920]   a great story about how you use that to get a job. But my
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   question is, do you have any tips for finding those secrets,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.280]   uncovering those things, and maybe give a little bit more
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.360]   context on on the chapter? Yeah, sure. I mean, I one of the
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.800]   people that I studied for this book was Brian Grazer. And
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.960]   Brian's a is a legendary Hollywood producer. He's has
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.440]   over 130 Emmys, he has dozens of Oscars, but he also runs large
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.280]   teams, runs large companies, and he invests in technology
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.000]   companies as well. And so he's kind of it was interesting when
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.760]   I went to go see him. This is before the pandemic, and I'm in
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.200]   his waiting room in Beverly Hills, there are people that
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.360]   are ready to pitch him on all sorts of things from films to
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.080]   technology to apply for jobs. And you could just tell that
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.760]   like, it was really anxious inside that room, like people
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.960]   were really nervous. And so when I went back to see him, I
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.400]   said, Look, Brian, if I could have given everybody out there
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.320]   one piece of advice, before they showed up here today on how to
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.120]   prepare for a meeting with Brian Grazer, what would that piece
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.080]   of advice have been? And he thought about that for a
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.920]   moment. And he said, Give me something that I can't easily
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.600]   find on Google. Give me something that's not obviously
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:52.560]   Googleable. And I thought that was so interesting, because the
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.600]   more that I talked to gatekeepers, decision makers,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   people who are classic backers, what I found is that like great
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.720]   meetings tend to be based on an insight that the person who's
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.080]   doing the pitching went out and found themselves. Like they
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.960]   didn't just sit behind a desk, but they went out and like found
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.080]   something that may have been just a little bit like less
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.200]   obvious. It doesn't have to necessarily be watershed. But
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.960]   they really put themselves into the story and found something
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.120]   that maybe they wouldn't have found had they just done sort
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.520]   of the classic research. So that could be that could be test
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.040]   driving a competitor's product. That could be going out to you
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.120]   know, like, literally attending a show or attending something
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.920]   that like, maybe other people wouldn't have attended. It's
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.200]   like, just taking like thinking to yourself, I like to kind of
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.080]   almost do a two step approach to this, I think to myself, like,
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.400]   what would most people do to prepare for this? And then how
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.920]   do I put myself just one step further into that story? Like,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.120]   how do what I what can I do to go one step beyond that, that
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.240]   takes me from behind Google, and into the real world in some
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.480]   way? And it could just be called, it could literally just
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.800]   be calling a set of customers and asking them what they what
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.880]   they think about this. And I was talking to somebody the other
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.440]   day. I know we've been talking a little bit about like applying
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.920]   for jobs. And I was talking to somebody the other day. And this
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.400]   was after my book came out. And she called me and she told me
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.880]   this story. And the story was that she was applying for a job.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.680]   She was a mom. And you know, she was returning to the
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.400]   workforce. And she was applying for a job at a social media
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.840]   company. And the trick of it was like, she didn't use the
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.040]   product. Like it was it was very much like a Gen Z focused
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.880]   product, and she doesn't use it. And so and she's like, she's
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.040]   like, so I was trying to figure out like what to do to prepare
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.000]   for this meeting for this role. And I was doing all my research,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.880]   I was I was coming through the through the site and reading
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.760]   people's bios and doing all the stuff that we typically do. But
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.760]   then she's like, you know, I need to do something more than
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.120]   this. So what she did is she decided to interview every
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.400]   single one of her daughter's friends, every single one of
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.840]   her daughter's friends, she interviewed them. I'm like,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.920]   What do you like about the product? What do you not like
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.680]   about the product? What do you wish? What do you wish to be
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.240]   different, all this stuff. And she accumulated all this
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.040]   research. And then she goes into this interview, which is
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.800]   which is over zoom during the pandemic. It's over zoom. And
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.560]   she literally like starts like, dropping all this like research
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.880]   on this person. Now, I don't know how much of it was
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.600]   different, how much of it that they didn't already know. But
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.880]   the fact that she had gone out there, like and done all this
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.440]   research and all this stuff that like people typically don't do.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.360]   This hiring manager was so impressed that not only did she
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.040]   get the job, but right in the middle of the meeting, he
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.960]   actually patched in one of their UX designers, who's like,
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.840]   Hey, like, you need to meet this person. And I want the two
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.480]   you to spend time together after this, because she collected a
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.600]   bunch of stuff that might be useful to you. So I just think
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   that that taking yourself one step beyond what most people
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.160]   would do to try to find something that might be a little
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.400]   less obvious. I mean, it just it does wonders.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.920]   Yeah, I mean, find something that might not be obvious, or
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.960]   even just do something that other people don't do.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.000]   Yes, exactly.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.280]   I've had people when I was hiring that it's amazing how few
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.360]   people do that. Like the amount of effort you have to put in to
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.600]   stand out as a job applicant, as a presentation giver, it's low
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   because so many people just do the minimum. And so I made a
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.080]   presentation. It was funny. I wanted this job at this hot
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.000]   startup back probably 2010. And I made a presentation. It was
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.560]   they were in the location space. And I made a presentation
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.840]   about location services. I looked back right and I got the
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.560]   job. And I've looked back now and I was like that
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.840]   presentation was horrible. I took some dumb market research
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.960]   report that had no relevance to what we were building. And I put
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.520]   it in a slide deck and I made some slides that were kind of
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.240]   silly. And like it was a terrible presentation that added
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.480]   no value to the company. But the fact that I made it gave them
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.360]   some knowledge that I actually cared about the company because
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360]   I wouldn't have taken the time to do this.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.040]   So they didn't ask you to make the presentation you just made.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.680]   No, no, no. I was like, instead of saying, "Hey, I want to work
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.600]   here." I said, "Hey, I made a presentation about the industry
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.120]   you guys are in and I would love to share it with you. And I want
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.400]   to work here." Now, the funny thing is there were no unique
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.760]   insights in this presentation. The unique insight was maybe
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.880]   that here's a person who cares about your company. So if I
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   could have found a unique insight, it would have been even
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.080]   more valuable. I'll just say that even without the unique
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.040]   insight, going above and beyond can add a ton of value.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.720]   Yeah, yeah. One of the reasons I think investors started to lean
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.480]   in on my idea for Rise was when they found out that I was going
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.360]   out to Weight Watchers meetings. And I was standing outside of
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.240]   Weight Watchers meetings. And when people were walking in, I'd
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.960]   be like, "Hey, I've got this prototype for a new app. Could I
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.080]   give you a demo?" And look, the vast majority of people said no.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.360]   But every once in a while, somebody would say yes. And I
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.440]   never really shared that story. Because it was kind of
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.320]   embarrassing for me. And also, it's not one of those
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.480]   sophisticated Silicon Valley ways of acquiring customers,
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.000]   right? I was a guy on the street. But somebody asked me in
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.640]   one of the early meetings, somebody asked me, "How did you
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.760]   find your first customers?" And so I told him the story. And
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.840]   that turned out to be the part of the pitch that he loved the
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.960]   most. He's like, "I love that." And so I started playing that
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.840]   up. And yeah, and that turned out to be the part that investors
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.640]   love the most is putting yourself out there. There's a
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.840]   story in the book about this publisher named Jonathan Karp,
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.120]   who really wanted to get Howard Stern to write a book. And I
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.720]   talked to Jonathan. And he was like, "I've been pursuing Howard
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:38.240]   Stern for 10 years to write a book." And he never would. And
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.160]   his answer to me was, "Look, I already have a couple of
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.720]   bestselling books. And writing a book takes a lot of time. I
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.080]   don't want to write another book. Leave me alone." And
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.560]   finally, Jonathan Karp was like, "Look, what do I need to
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.920]   do in order to get him to say yes?" And he thinks about it.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.200]   And he's like, "The vast majority of what Howard Stern
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.480]   would write about is actually kind of already out there right
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.760]   now. It's in his interviews." Because what he would probably
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.400]   do in this book is he'd probably be writing about the most
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.640]   interesting people that he's interviewed for this show. And
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.600]   so what Jonathan Karp did is he literally took transcripts of
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.280]   all these interviews and personally called those down
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.160]   into something that was very readable, and then put them in
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.120]   a leather-bound cover. And he shows up at Howard Stern's
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.000]   apartment. And Howard Stern's like, "Look, I told you I'm not
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   going to write this book." And Jonathan Karp's like, "Well,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.840]   here's the book." Like literally hands it to him. And what
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.800]   Howard Stern said is like in that moment, he was so
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.200]   intoxicated by the effort that Jonathan Karp had put into the
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.960]   process that he could not say no.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.240]   - That's amazing. Maybe one day I'll get there and somebody's
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   going to write my book for me and just hand it to me. That
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.560]   would be, you know, that's how you know you made it when
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.160]   someone out there writes a book for you.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.920]   - Well, in the meantime, we're looking forward to you writing
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.720]   your own book, Chris.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.440]   - Yeah. So I feel like that story comes back to where we
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.040]   started about having the conviction to get out there and
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.920]   believe in your idea and get in front of other people. I want
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.880]   to wrap with a few things. Is there a story that didn't make
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.240]   it in the book that you wished it?
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.120]   - Yeah. There was a theme that I had been really playing with
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.960]   and I really wanted to make it work, but you know, I felt like
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.480]   it wasn't ready. But today I definitely do feel like it is,
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.400]   which is that, you know, when we walk into a room, we are a
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.000]   combination of both the information that we bring and the
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.800]   energy that we bring. And oftentimes when we prepare for a
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.520]   meeting, we're preparing for the information, but we're not
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.720]   really preparing for the energy, right? Like one of the things I
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.760]   think about before I walk into a room now is like how do I want
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.000]   people to think? What do I want people to do? But most
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.040]   importantly, how do I want them to feel as a result of this
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.000]   meeting, right? Like what's the feeling that I want people to
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.400]   have? Because I think Maya Angelou said it the best, which
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.560]   is like people will forget what you said, people will forget
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.960]   what you did, but they will never forget the way that you
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.880]   made them feel. And the reason that I think this is important
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.800]   is that like we are living in such a back-to-back world now,
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.520]   especially like for those of us who are like working remotely,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.480]   it can be very easy to sort of jam your schedule with meetings
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.080]   and go back to back to back. But I think it's become so, so
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.560]   important to just take a few minutes in between these
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.280]   meetings, right? To literally just schedule 55-minute
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.560]   meetings instead of 60-minute meetings in order to give
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.320]   yourself like that five minutes that you need in order to reset
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.200]   in order to kind of like reset your energetic state. Because we
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.600]   know the information we want to bring the next meeting, but if
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.680]   all we're doing is compiling sort of like the energy decline,
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.920]   then by the time we get to some of our most important meetings
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.640]   or moments, we might actually be bringing the wrong energy into
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.880]   the room or to the space. And so what I think is extremely
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.440]   important right now is to have what I call rhythmic recovery.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.080]   And, you know, again, the way that I think about that is like
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.680]   for every 55 minutes, I take five minutes to just like
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.320]   recover energetically, right? And that could be doing a
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.440]   breathing exercise, that could be doing pushups, but just
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.080]   something to kind of reset my energy so that what I'm bringing
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.120]   to my next meeting isn't just like, you know, accumulation of
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.200]   like the negative stuff that's been happening throughout the
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:11.700]   day.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.680]   I love that. I'll add one interesting thing that someone
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.960]   told me once is you might be in a situation where you just have
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.280]   to bring the negative energy to the meeting. You're 10 minutes
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.200]   late, your last meeting was horrible, you got to go. Someone
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.760]   once, I can't remember, there was kind of like a stoplight
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.560]   methodology, but it was basically when you come into a
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.320]   meeting, if you have negative energy, call it out. And
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.520]   sometimes that can change the dynamic. You could say, "Hey,
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.840]   guys, I just want to let you know my last meeting was really
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.800]   terrible. I'm not in a great mood, but I'm really excited to
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.000]   be here. So if that comes across, just know that it has
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.960]   nothing to do with this meeting." And you can kind of, I
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.560]   use this a lot, even in presentations, call out the
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.800]   thing that might be a problem. "Hey, I don't have data on
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:00.720]   whether my customers will do this, use this product. If
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.520]   that's a problem, I can just stop now." And you kind of like
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.280]   shove aside whatever it is, negative energy or a part of
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.720]   your business or your proposal that doesn't work, and lay that
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.720]   out at front. So people kind of get to take that off their kind
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.720]   of mind throughout the conversation.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.400]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, Reid Hoffman told me a great story. He's
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.560]   founder of LinkedIn. And he was telling me about how in 2003,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.720]   he's pitching the company, but this is like shortly after the
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.440]   dot-com bubble had burst, right? And now he's got this
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.200]   company that isn't making a dime of revenue, and all investors
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.400]   want are companies that are making money. And so he's out
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.840]   there, and he's pitching LinkedIn. And one of the things
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.800]   he said that really saved him during that time is that he
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.400]   would steer into the objection. He steered right into the
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.120]   objection of not making money. So up front, he would say,
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.880]   "Listen, before we move into all the strengths, all the
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.200]   reasons I think you should invest, I want to tell you up
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.960]   front that we're not making revenue right now. But further
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.160]   on, I'm going to talk about three ways in which I think we
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.720]   might be able to over the next few years. I'm going to share
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.800]   three ideas I have." And so these three ideas were not
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.720]   bulletproof. They weren't completely solid. But what he
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.280]   said is just by sharing that up front, by steering into the
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.840]   objection, what that did is it bought him a lot of credibility,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.640]   right? Because he was willing to sort of put that out there
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.000]   himself. And then to your point, Chris, because he did
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.640]   that, that objection stopped nagging at them, right? Because
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.440]   if he hadn't said that, then the idea that they weren't
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.520]   making money would have nagged at them the entire time. So he
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.520]   could have been talking about the cool product, the cool
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.760]   features, all the cool things they want to do, the network
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.840]   effects. And yet at the same time, they would have been
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.160]   nagging at them the whole time. And now that he already put it
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.640]   out there, they could actually tune into the stronger parts of
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.140]   this pitch.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:56.720]   Yeah, that's fantastic. Okay. I feel like if you want more
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.520]   content like this, just read the book. I'm not going to dig any
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.200]   deeper. It was fantastic. I actually listened to it. You
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.400]   were the narrator, which was a little weird. I'm hearing you
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.640]   tell stories. I'm like, "Man, I've heard this story." But no,
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.960]   it's because I heard you read the book, not because we talked
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.320]   about it. So I just want to know, you wrote the book. It
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.800]   came out earlier this year. What's next? What are you
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.320]   spending your time on now?
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.840]   Yeah. I mean, the next book that I'm working on with Harper
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.720]   Collins is all about energy. It's all about how do we get
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.200]   more energy. And I'm trying to do the same thing that I did
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.320]   with Backable, which is like skip the obvious diet, sleep,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.040]   and start going into sort of what are some things that are
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.240]   hidden. And what I'm finding is that it's taking me not only
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.200]   into just modern science, but it's also taking me back to
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.120]   like ancient wisdom, things that we have lost along the
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.040]   way. The art of what we might know as chi, or what the
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.120]   Hindus call prana. There's a lot of things that we sort of
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.120]   have just kind of lost that I think in a busy society, we
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.920]   don't think about. But there are certain people who I think
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.000]   have become just masters at being able to manage their
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.280]   energy, not just their time, but their energy that have done
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.600]   incredible things for the world. So I'm studying those
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.160]   people, I'm studying these techniques, I'm studying the
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.280]   science. And the idea is to bring it all together in one,
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.400]   you know, coherent book that anybody can use and how to how
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.360]   to boost their energy.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.120]   That's amazing. You know, you said last time you started
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.000]   doing these interviews, and it was years before the book came
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.800]   out. How long might we have to wait to read this?
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.640]   This one's gonna be a little quicker. This one's gonna be a
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.200]   little quicker. I mean, it's something that I've been
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.240]   thinking about for a long time. And I sort of just even while
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.360]   I was writing backable, I was I was I was collecting research.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.000]   It's just, it's always been a fascinating topic for me, you
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.920]   know, especially, I mean, I don't know how you feel about
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.840]   this, Chris. But like, I certainly feel like I have less
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:55.200]   energy than I did 10 years ago. Right? And yet, the demands on
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:58.320]   my energy are so much more, right? And I think most people
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.960]   feel that way. If you ask most people, like, hey, do you feel
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.280]   more energy or less energy now than you did 10 years ago, most
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.040]   people are gonna say less energy. But then you ask them,
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.440]   like, what, what about the demands on your energy? Are they
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.160]   more? Are they less than or more? Right? And, and so it's
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.120]   no surprise that that people burn out very quickly. And it
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.600]   used to be that you hear about people who burnt out in their
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.640]   40s and 50s. And, and now it's like people are burning out in
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   their teens and 20s. And it's happening much sooner. And so I
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.240]   think, I think we just need we need an answer to this. And so
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.600]   there's urgency. So I want to get it out there, obviously do
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.200]   do the real work and go really deep. But the idea is get out
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.680]   there next year, if not early the year after. Awesome. Well, I
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.640]   can't wait. Is there anywhere people can follow along as to
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.520]   what you're working on and what you're up to until then? Yeah,
