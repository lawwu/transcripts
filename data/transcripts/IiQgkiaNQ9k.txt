[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.440]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.640]   John answered them, saying, I baptize with water; but there standeth one among you whom
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.240]   ye know not, and I knew him not.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.000]   But he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.720]   see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   Holy Ghost.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.440]   Now we are studying this great doctrine which is conveyed to us and suggested to us by the
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.840]   words I have just read to you, and in particular this statement by John the Baptist that it
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.400]   was to be our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who would baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.200]   We have been considering the difference between the baptism of John and this baptism with
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.560]   the Holy Ghost, which John here predicts and prophesies is to be done by our Lord.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.560]   And we are doing so because, obviously, it is a very vital doctrine.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.040]   We are told here in this Gospel, in the prologue, that a Christian is one who is received of
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.120]   The New Testament gives us a picture and a portrayal of what a Christian should be.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.240]   And obviously, in that connection, nothing is more vital and important than that we should
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.760]   understand this teaching, this doctrine, concerning the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.880]   According to the teaching which we have been considering, this is the thing that marks
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.680]   the great difference between the Old Testament saints and the New Testament saints.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   The Old Testament saints were children of God, but they had not been baptized with the
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   Holy Ghost.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.680]   This is, if you like, the differentiator of the New Testament Christian, that he is baptized
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.800]   with the Holy Ghost.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.240]   And therefore I am arguing that it is of very urgent importance that we should understand
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   what this teaching really conveys to us.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.760]   We do that, I say, not only that we may enjoy the full blessing of the Christian salvation,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.640]   but still more and still more urgently because of the times in which we live.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.320]   We see a Christian church more or less powerless, ineffective in a world of sin and shame, in
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.600]   a world that is increasingly manifesting in horrible and horrifying manners, godlessness
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.000]   and hatred and antagonism to God.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.800]   And there is only one hope for such a world, and that is a revived church.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.680]   The most urgent need of the hour is revival in the Christian church, and that means revival
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.040]   in individual Christians.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.960]   There is no such thing as the church apart from people.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.920]   So we start with the personal, and through that we see how the general can be affected.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.840]   Well now, in order to try to bring out this doctrine, I have suggested that perhaps the
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.040]   most convenient thing to do is to put to you a number of general principles or propositions.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.240]   We started with the first last Sunday morning, and the first proposition was this, that clearly
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:50.280]   from the teaching of the Old Testament and the New, it is possible for one to be a believer
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.600]   and a Christian without having received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.920]   Now I gave you the evidence for that last Sunday morning.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.240]   Let's be clear about this again.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.200]   You can't be a Christian at all without having the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.520]   A Christian is a man who is born of the Spirit.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.200]   The Spirit does the work of regeneration in him.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.960]   If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of hills.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.800]   So a Christian, by definition, is a man who has the Holy Spirit in him, dwelling in him.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.960]   But that does not mean that he is baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.560]   I gave you instances of that in the teaching concerning it, both from the Old Testament
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.400]   and the New.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.320]   Now this, of course, is the basic proposition, and that is why this is the aspect of the
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.240]   teaching that is most frequently controverted, not to say attacked.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.800]   And therefore I propose to deal with this still further.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.200]   This being the foundational principle, if it is true on the other hand to say that you
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.040]   can't be a Christian without being baptized with the Spirit, that it is something that
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.000]   is virtually synonymous with regeneration, well then, of course, the whole position is
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.340]   changed.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.200]   That is why I am holding you with this particular general principle, because to me it is a very
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.920]   vital that we should see that there is an essential distinction, that you can be regenerate,
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.880]   a child of God, a true believer, and still not have received the baptism with the Holy
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   Spirit.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.920]   I don't go over the evidence again, because I have already given it to you.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:52.880]   But now I say we must substantiate this yet further.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.280]   And what I propose to do, therefore, this morning is to give you certain additional
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:08.760]   reasons or arguments why it is so vital and essential for us to hold this distinction.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.920]   Now an argument that is very often brought against this teaching which separates regeneration
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.040]   and the baptism with the Holy Ghost is, they say, yes, but you always, all of you who hold
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.120]   that view, you seem to base it all upon the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.760]   Someone may say to me, you did that last Sunday.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.200]   Well I did it partly, not only, I gave other scriptures also, in the Gospels and in the
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.120]   Epistles, but that is the argument that is generally put forward.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.480]   They say, you must have found your doctrine on the history of the book of the Acts of
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   the Apostles.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.720]   That's a very dangerous thing to do.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.400]   You must have found your doctrine only upon the teaching of our Lord himself and upon
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.800]   the teaching of the Epistles.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.560]   Now this is frequently said, and we must therefore deal with it.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.200]   And the answer, of course, is quite simple.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.620]   You should never put one section of scripture against another.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.200]   You should never say it's either got to be this or that.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.840]   The true position is to take the book of the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.280]   It is characteristic of the higher critical attitude to put scripture against scripture,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.440]   to depreciate one at the expense of another.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   So there is that fundamental answer to this criticism.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.280]   But furthermore, we must go beyond that and say this, that surely one of the main purposes
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.600]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles is to show us the fulfilment of this promise
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.760]   concerning the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   It has been promised.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.560]   It is called the promise of the Father.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.560]   In the very first chapter of Acts, as we have seen several Sunday mornings, our Lord himself,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.080]   after the resurrection, just before the ascension, he turns to his disciples, who with their
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.800]   materialistic outlook still were concerned about the restoration of the kingdom to Israel,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:19.320]   and says it's not for you to know the times and the seasons, but you shall receive power
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.600]   when the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses to me in Jerusalem
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.800]   and Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:35.320]   And in that context, he has quoted the statement about John the Baptist baptising with water,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.480]   but that he would baptise with the Holy Ghost.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   Very well.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.200]   And then the remainder of the book is just to tell us how this happened.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.640]   Chapter 2 tells us how the Holy Ghost actually came, as our Lord prophesied, upon the early
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.520]   church, upon the 120 on the day of Pentecost, and later upon the 3,000 who had believed.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.760]   And it goes on to give us further examples and illustrations which we have already looked
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   at.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.120]   Well, now, surely this is quite basic to any doctrine of the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.120]   There we are told how it happened, what its results were, how it was recognised.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.560]   It is an essential, vital part of the teaching.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.000]   And of course, if people come along and say, "Ah, yes, but that was only at the beginning,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   you know.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That was only the start."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.680]   Well, that is a still more serious thing to say.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.020]   That is to say that the Scripture does not apply to us.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:43.520]   One agrees, of course, that there are exceptional times in the history of the Church, but it
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.160]   is always wrong to say that any teaching in Scripture has nothing to do with us, that
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.600]   it was exceptional.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.640]   What we read in the whole of the Scripture must be applied to ourselves, and it is a
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.240]   kind of pattern or standard or norm of what we should expect individually and in the case
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   of the Christian Church.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.200]   Let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.600]   What is a revival of religion?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.280]   Well, it is generally agreed that the best way of defining a revival is to say that it
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.960]   is the Church returning to the Book of Acts.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.760]   It is a repetition of the Book of Acts, a kind of repetition of Pentecost.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.840]   It is the Spirit being poured out again upon the Church.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.920]   And this, of course, is a very vital and essential bit of doctrine.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:39.880]   But to go still further, and this to me is perhaps the most important point of all, there
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:49.080]   is nothing which is more fatal than to fail to see that the teaching of the epistles always
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:56.240]   presupposes the history which we have in the Book of Acts of the apostles.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.480]   You see, what some people are trying to do, and they have done it in the past and they
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.400]   are still trying to do it, is to say that, "Ah, well, what you have got in the Book
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.120]   of Acts is very exceptional, it is just the beginning of the Church."
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.280]   The norm is what you get in the teaching of the epistles.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:22.840]   Now I say the reply to that is this, that the teaching of the epistles always presupposes
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.160]   what we read of as having happened in the Book of the Acts of the apostles.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.400]   Now, I can prove this to you quite simply.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.520]   Take for instance the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.940]   Look at that great epistle.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.480]   What is the teaching of this epistle?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.880]   What is it based upon?
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.760]   Well, obviously, it is based upon the fact that the members of the Church at Corinth
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   have been baptized with the Spirit in the way that we read of in the Book of the Acts
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.760]   of the apostles.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.680]   We are told sometimes, "You never find the epistles exhorting people to be baptized with
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.680]   the Spirit."
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.760]   That is perfectly right, but the answer is obvious.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:10.040]   They are not exhorted to be baptized with the Spirit because they were already baptized
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   with the Spirit.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:18.200]   What is the meaning of those three chapters, 12, 13, and 14 of the first Corinthians?
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   What do they deal with?
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.800]   Well, the answer is that they are dealing with certain excesses which had arisen and
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.600]   certain misunderstandings in people who had been baptized with the Spirit.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.160]   As I have often put it, how many churches do you know at the present time that you need
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.440]   to write the first epistle to the Corinthians to them?
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.280]   How many churches are there today that need to have the teaching of 1 Corinthians 12,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.560]   13, and 14?
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.040]   The answer is a precious few.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   Why?
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.960]   Well, you see, there was a church baptized with the Spirit.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.200]   The members were baptized with the Spirit, and because of that, because of the kind of
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.320]   thing that is described in the book of the Acts, had happened to them.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.200]   Problems arose and there were certain difficulties.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.840]   Now, this is surely, therefore, a very important matter.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.440]   It shows that this attempt to differentiate between the teaching of the book of the Acts
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:29.160]   of the apostles and the epistles is wrong and is completely false.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:35.280]   You see, the epistles were generally written to correct.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.560]   They are written because of situations that had arisen.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:46.200]   Now, that's not only true of the first epistle to the Corinthians; it is equally true of
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:52.880]   the teaching of an epistle like that to the Galatians.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.240]   Let me illustrate what I mean by reading to you from a recent writer on these matters,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.120]   in dealing with Galatians.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.560]   He says further, "It is a fundamental principle of biblical interpretation to begin with the
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.760]   general, not with the special."
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.000]   What he means by that is this.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.560]   He is illustrating this point.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.480]   You see, the history of the book of the Acts, he says, is special, but the general, the
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.960]   ordinary, is that which you find in the epistles.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.320]   So he goes on to say, "If it be asked what the general teaching, as distinct from the
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.800]   special teaching of the New Testament, is regarding the reception of the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.360]   we can give a plain and definite answer.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:46.600]   We receive the Holy Spirit by hearing the gospel with faith," Galatians 3.2, or, more
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.520]   simply still, through faith, Galatians 3.14.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.400]   And thereby, the writer thinks he has established his case.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.880]   He says, "Now, here is the general, here is the ordinary, here is the thing that we
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.640]   should expect for ourselves.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.420]   We are not in the days of the book of the Acts of the apostles, which are special.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   This is the ordinary."
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.600]   So he quotes Galatians 3.2 and Galatians 3.14.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.440]   Let me read them to you.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.240]   Look at the first two verses of this third chapter of Galatians.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.120]   "O foolish Galatians," says Paul, "who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.520]   the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   you?
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.160]   This only would I learn of you.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.480]   Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.600]   And then the fourteenth verse reads like this, "That the blessing of Abram might come on
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.520]   the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   faith."
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.720]   Now, that writer, you see, he identifies receiving the Spirit or being baptized with the Spirit
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.060]   with believing the gospel, with regeneration, with becoming a Christian.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.160]   And he says, "This is the normal way.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.360]   You believe and receive the Spirit by faith."
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.760]   So you mustn't say that the baptism with the Spirit is something which is different
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.600]   and distinct from belief and regeneration.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.360]   And he says, "This is the normal, this is the general, this is the ordinary for the
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.840]   church."
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:33.040]   But in a most interesting way, he evidently failed to remember what we are told in the
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.600]   fifth verse.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.920]   Now, this is the kind of confusion people get into when they don't draw these distinctions.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.640]   Remember, the saying is that Galatians is the general, the ordinary, what we should
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.000]   expect ourselves.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.800]   But this is what I read in Galatians 3, 5.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:56.920]   "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.920]   he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith."
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.720]   Is that the general and the normal?
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.080]   "Worketh miracles among you, ministereth the Spirit to you."
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:16.200]   You see, this is not just a description of how people came to believe.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.280]   That isn't what the apostle is asking.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.840]   He's already dealt with that in the first two chapters, incidentally, how you believe
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.680]   and are justified by faith.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.800]   He's producing now an additional argument.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.640]   He says, "Look here, not only do you believe and be saved by faith rather than by circumcision."
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.080]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.320]   When you received the Spirit, when the Spirit came upon you, when you received the baptism
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   of the Spirit, tell me, was that the result of keeping the works of the law, or was it
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.360]   this whole matter of your faith relationship to God in Christ?
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.000]   And of course, I prove that that is what he's talking about by that fifth verse.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   "He that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you."
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.600]   Are we to say that this is the general and the ordinary and the usual?
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   No, no.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.320]   This church of the Galatians was baptized with the Spirit, was filled with the Spirit.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.080]   It was a church in which miracles were being demonstrated.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.040]   Of course, this was true of every single New Testament church.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.720]   Not only the Corinthian church, but also the church of Galatia.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:33.240]   In other words, I am establishing my point that you really cannot truly interpret nor
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:40.040]   understand the teaching of the epistles unless you do so in the light of the history of the
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.760]   book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.780]   Very well then, there is something that is quite crucial with regard to this whole matter.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.000]   But let me give you a second argument.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.960]   I trust I've demonstrated what a complete fallacy it is to say that you have to discount
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.520]   the history of the Acts and only take your teaching from the epistles.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.320]   You can't understand the epistles except in the light of the background of what had
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.200]   happened in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:18.480]   But secondly, when we will come later to consider the effects of the baptism with the Spirit,
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.080]   I think we shall find that one of the main effects and results of the baptism with the
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.400]   Holy Ghost is to give us an unusual assurance of our salvation.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.680]   And that is why, of course, I am dealing with this whole subject.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.360]   The greatest need, I say, at the present time is Christian people who are assured of their
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360]   salvation.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.400]   If we confront the world saying, "Well, I hope I'm saved, I'm not sure, but I hope,
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.440]   well, we'll be depressed and we'll depress others and we shan't attract."
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.960]   The thing that was so obvious about the New Testament Christians was their spirit of joy
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.400]   and happiness and assurance, their confidence.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.440]   They were so certain that they were ready to be thrown to the lions in the arena or
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   put to death.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.760]   And this has always characterized every great period of reformation and revival in the history
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   of the Church.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   Very well.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.480]   Now, one of the main effects of the baptism with the Spirit, as you see, for instance,
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:25.040]   in Acts 2 or anywhere else, is that a tremendous assurance and certainty is given to men and
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   women.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.880]   So, you see, we are entitled to say this.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:40.240]   If you identify the baptism with the Spirit with belief in the Lord Jesus Christ and to
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:47.720]   salvation, you are automatically saying that there is no difference between saving faith
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.280]   and an assurance of faith.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.160]   And this is a very serious matter.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.480]   And of course, people who don't draw this distinction, they actually say that.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.760]   Let me give you a quotation again from the same writer.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:08.760]   As a result, he says, "All God's sons possess the Spirit, are led by the Spirit, and are
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:16.560]   assured by the Spirit of their sonship and of God's love, while those who do not possess
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.960]   the Spirit do not belong to Christ at all."
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.440]   Now, I hope you are taking this in.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.720]   All God's sons possess the Spirit.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   That's all right.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.200]   Are led by the Spirit.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.120]   Is that true of necessity?
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.640]   But still more, "and are assured by the Spirit of their sonship and of God's love."
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.520]   He quotes Romans 8, 15 and 16, and 5.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.440]   And the contrast is, "while those who do not possess the Spirit do not belong to Christ
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   at all."
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.200]   Now then, here is the question that I would put to you.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:08.440]   Is it true to say of all believers that they possess this great and full assurance of salvation?
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.480]   You remember Romans 8, 15 and 16?
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.840]   "Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.160]   of adoption whereby ye cry, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.080]   And what Paul uses there, which expresses this, that out of the depth of our being comes
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.920]   an elemental cry, "Abba, Father!"
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.320]   And then he goes on, he says, "The Spirit also testifieth with our spirits that we are
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.480]   the sons of God."
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:43.400]   It's the highest form of assurance, an absolute certainty, a glorying and a crying out of
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.880]   "Abba, Father!"
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:51.640]   We are told that this is true of every Christian.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.320]   Now do you see the consequence of that?
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.400]   Do you all possess that assurance?
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.360]   Have you got this elemental cry in you, crying out, "Abba, Father!"?
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.080]   Do you know beyond any doubt or dispute or peradventure or hesitation that you are the
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.840]   children of God and joined together with—are you rejoicing in a full assurance?
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.680]   You see the consequence of this confusion.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   It is to say that large numbers of people who are Christian are not Christian at all.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.840]   Now this is an old matter.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.560]   There's nothing new about this.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.680]   This was something that was fought out at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.340]   of the seventeenth century.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:42.200]   Some of the early Reformers, in order to counteract the false teaching of Rome, had said that
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.560]   you couldn't be a Christian unless you had assurance.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.640]   In other words, they said there is no difference between saving faith and assurance of salvation.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.520]   But when on reflection, Protestant leaders came to see that this was quite wrong.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:00.240]   And therefore, in a document like the Westminster Confession of Faith, and indeed all the other
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.840]   great confessions, you will find that they are very careful to draw a sharp distinction
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.120]   between saving faith and assurance of faith.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.720]   And it's very important.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.040]   The Bible never says that we are saved by assurance.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.920]   We are saved by faith.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.480]   In other words, there are many Christian people who have come to see and to know that they
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.880]   are sinners, that they are under the wrath of God, that they are helpless, that they
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.160]   are hopeless, and who are afraid of the judgment, who realize furthermore that should they spend
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.760]   the rest of their lives in a monastery trying to live a good life and to please and to satisfy
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   God and to work up righteousness, they'll be no further on at the end than they were
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.360]   at the beginning.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:52.680]   And just as they are in simple faith, they say, "I trust myself only to the Lord Jesus
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.880]   Christ."
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.440]   They believe the truth concerning him, they believe on him, and they rest on that.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.760]   They're constantly having to go back and do it again.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.600]   The devil attacks them, and they're terrified, they fall into sin, and they feel they're
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.880]   not Christians at all.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.840]   But they say, "I have nothing but Jesus Christ and the fact that he died for me."
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.720]   Well, now, I say, and the Bible says that such people are Christians.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.320]   They're Christians, but they haven't got full assurance of salvation.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.880]   They are not enjoying full assurance of faith.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   They are like the people to whom the Apostle John was writing in his first epistle, "These
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.760]   things write I unto you who believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.840]   ye have eternal life."
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.200]   There is no question about this.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.080]   There have been saints who have testified to this throughout the centuries, that for
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.600]   years they believed, but they didn't enjoy assurance.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.480]   They were uncertain, they were unhappy.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.000]   They always came back and said, "I have nothing but Christ."
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   You mustn't disenfranchise these people.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.260]   You mustn't say, "These people are not Christians."
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:02.320]   But if you say that every Son of God, every Christian, has full assurance by the Spirit
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.360]   of Sonship and of God's love, you are saying that these people are not Christian at all.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.880]   And that, I say, is not only wrong, but it's a very cruel thing to say.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.920]   Oh yes, you can be a Christian without assurance.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.040]   There have been saints who have gone through their lives in a fearful state.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.080]   They shouldn't have been in that state.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.160]   Sometimes it's due to psychological conditions, sometimes it's due to wrong teaching.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.560]   They are Christians, all right, but they have never enjoyed this assurance.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:40.720]   And it's a terrible thing, not only a wrong thing, to confuse saving faith with full assurance
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   of faith.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.320]   But you see, the moment you begin to do things like this, you get into difficulties and you
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.040]   begin to contradict yourself.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.160]   For the same writer goes on to say this, and this, I believe, is my last quotation.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:27:01.520]   "Sometimes," listen, "sometimes the Holy Spirit may do his distinctively new covenant
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:09.100]   work of glorifying the Lord Jesus, that is, revealing and manifesting him in such a way
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:15.960]   as to make us," and he quotes 1 Peter 1.8, "rejoice with unutterable and exalted joy."
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.400]   Now, here's the point of this quotation.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:25.080]   "Sometimes," he says, "sometimes the Holy Spirit may do his distinctive work in such
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.680]   a way as to make us rejoice with unutterable and exalted joy."
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:35.000]   He goes on, he says, "Sometimes we may have visions and revelations or have some such
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.400]   experience as Paul had in 2 Corinthians 12, 1 to 4."
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:44.680]   Then he adds this, "I do not for a moment deny any of these things.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:55.760]   Yes, these are not the usual, general, or common purpose of God for all his people,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:05.120]   but the unusual, particular, and exceptional ministries of the Holy Spirit to some.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:11.680]   Nor should they, such people who have had these, urge the same experiences upon others
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.600]   as if they were the spiritual norm."
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.960]   Now, then, why do I call attention to this?
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.680]   Well, this is very interesting.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.480]   You see, what he's saying is this, that the position in which one rejoices with a
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:34.320]   joy unspeakable and full of glory is exceptional, unusual, particular.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.400]   It is something that happens sometimes.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.520]   But what does the Scripture say?
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.600]   To whom is the apostle Peter writing?
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.440]   Listen, he starts off like this, 1 Peter, first chapter, first verse, "Peter, an apostle
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:56.360]   of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   Asia, and Bithynia, elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.920]   of the Spirit and to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   Who is he writing to?
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.200]   Is he writing to exceptional Christians?
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.160]   Is he writing only to a body of apostles or church leaders?
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:21.080]   Is he writing to people and saying, "Now, you are a most unusual people"?
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.400]   He's writing to ordinary church members.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.840]   He doesn't even know their names, their strangers scattered abroad.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.120]   He says, "I'm writing to you, and I know that this is true of you, whom having not
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:40.440]   seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.880]   and full of glory."
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.440]   Peter himself makes it clear that he's not writing about something exceptional, something
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.400]   that sometimes happens.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:55.520]   He is assuming it to be the norm and the normal experience of ordinary, unknown members of
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.960]   the Christian church.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:04.120]   And yet, you see, because of a wrong doctrine, our writer says, "This is sometimes, this
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.120]   is exceptional."
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.160]   No, no, this is the ordinary and the usual.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.640]   Very well, says someone.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.200]   Are you now then saying yourself that we, all of us, should be able to say that we rejoice
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.080]   in Christ with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.400]   My answer is quite simple.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.840]   We all ought to be able to say that.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.220]   But I do not say for a second that if you can't say that, that you're not a Christian.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.480]   What is the explanation?
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.280]   The explanation is this.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.240]   As I've already indicated, what I'm really proving is this.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:47.280]   All the teaching of the epistles is based upon the history of what happens in the book
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.760]   of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:56.440]   The teaching of the epistles always presupposes what is described in the book of the Acts
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.640]   of the Apostles.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.400]   In other words, there is only one way you can understand the New Testament epistles,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.320]   and it's this.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   God started the Christian church by pouring down his Spirit upon her.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.360]   So the New Testament church is a church that is baptized with the Spirit.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.260]   And all the teaching of the New Testament assumes that.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.600]   This is what the church is meant to be.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.340]   She often isn't.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.120]   She often hasn't been anything like this in her long history.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.100]   She isn't like this today.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.600]   But this is what she should be like.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.880]   Now in the New Testament epistles you obviously don't get exhortations to people to seek
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.160]   the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   Why?
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.320]   Because they'd already had it.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.240]   In exactly the same way, when there is a time of revival and the Spirit is outpoured, you
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.800]   don't urge this.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.540]   Your problem then will be to deal with the tendencies to excesses and a certain element
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.480]   of riot that comes in, and you'll have to preach order.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.520]   In other words, you'll be back in the position of the New Testament church.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:05.760]   But the apostle Peter knew that these people, having been baptized with the Spirit, were
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.400]   filled with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:18.600]   He far from saying that it was exceptional, takes it as the standard and as the norm.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:25.540]   Therefore I say once more that there is nothing more dangerous than to start by saying you
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:30.200]   must ignore the book of the Acts of the apostles and look for your teaching only in the teaching
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.320]   of our Lord or in the teaching of the New Testament epistles.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.160]   Very well, let me give you a third answer to this difficulty that people seem to be
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.400]   in.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:49.680]   If regeneration and baptism of the Spirit are one, and not to be differentiated, then
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.160]   I think we can say, from what we have already seen, that obviously the apostles had it in
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.720]   their power to regenerate people.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.840]   You remember the case of Acts 19, the people at Ephesus.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.700]   The apostle expounded the truth to them, they believed it, he baptized them in the name
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.040]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   Well, then you see he laid his hands upon them and they were baptized with the Spirit.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.760]   If you identify baptism of the Spirit, therefore, with regeneration, you must say that it was
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.720]   the apostle by laying hands upon those people who regenerated them.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.080]   And the same with all the other examples.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.880]   Peter and John, when they went down to Samaria, must have done the same thing.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.440]   But the answer, as we have already seen, is this, that these people were already regenerated.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.840]   They believed the gospel.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.480]   And it was afterwards, after they had been regenerated, that hands were laid upon them,
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:50.880]   in all these instances—Acts 8, Acts 19—and then they received the baptism of the Holy
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.880]   Ghost.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:58.360]   Very well, there is my third argument, but let me come to a fourth, which is rather interesting.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.240]   There are certain sections of the Christian Church who believe in what they call confirmation.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.800]   They hold what they call confirmation services.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.000]   You are familiar with that.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.160]   The Anglican Church does it in this country, the Roman Catholic Church does it, the Lutheran
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.360]   Church does it.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   Confirmation.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.280]   Most interesting.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.440]   Where does this come from?
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:25.120]   Well, they say that it is derived from what we read in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:32.840]   6, verse 1, about laying on of hands, doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.040]   And they say it is also based upon what we read about the apostles, Peter and John, doing
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.600]   in Samaria, and what Paul did with those people in Ephesus.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.400]   Now there are those who write like this.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:51.720]   They say that confirmation is the way that the Anglican Church has chosen to receive
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:57.360]   into full membership those who have been baptized, usually in infancy, and have themselves repented
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.960]   and believed.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:06.200]   They say further that it is something that God may use as a sign to certify the candidate
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.320]   of his God's favor.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.640]   No, the answer to that is this.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:18.120]   This is not something that the Anglican Church has chosen as a manner of receiving people
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.280]   into full membership.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.760]   The actual history is this.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.560]   The Anglican Church just continued what the Roman Catholic Church had been doing throughout
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   the centuries.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.680]   It is not something the Anglican Church has decided or chosen to do.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   It is simply a part of the incompleteness of the Reformation of the sixteenth century.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.080]   They continued with a number of things, and the Puritans, of course, objected to these
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   things.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.840]   Confirmation is one of them.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.640]   But what is interesting to us is this.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:55.040]   I don't believe in confirmation, but nevertheless, it is an argument which is of great value
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   at this point.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.800]   Where did confirmation ever come from?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.560]   Well, I think I have told you something about its origin.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:11.240]   You see, from the beginning there was a distinction between believing and being baptized in water
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.120]   and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   I have shown you, and you see it in the Scriptures, there was always this distinction between
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   the two things.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.720]   Paul baptized these men at Ephesus.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.280]   Then having finished it, he laid his hands upon them, and they received the baptism of
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.360]   the Holy Ghost and began to speak in tongues.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.840]   The two things are separate and distinct.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.480]   Now, the early Church perpetuated that.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.000]   And according to the historians—and I have taken considerable trouble this week to look
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.200]   it up again to make quite sure of all the facts—the historians agreed in saying this,
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:53.240]   that in the early days, the orvishere, the bishop, was the man who did the baptism with
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.800]   water and the laying on of hands.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:03.440]   But as the numbers greatly increased, he found that he could not do this.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.840]   So then there was a division.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:14.080]   The act of baptism in water was given to the parish priest, if you like, but the one of
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:21.880]   laying on of hands was reserved for the visit of the orvishere, or as he became known increasingly,
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   as the bishop.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.240]   Now, there is clear evidence about this in the writings of one of those great Church
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.480]   fathers, Tertullian, at the end of the second century.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.040]   And by the fourth century, this was the common practice.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.480]   And of course it is continued until today.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.320]   The local parish priest, whatever he is, he does the baptizing, but the bishop is the
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.080]   man who comes to do the confirming.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.680]   Now, I am only putting this evidence before you in order to substantiate this point, that
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:59.200]   this distinction which is so plain in the New Testament has been recognized throughout
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   the centuries.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.480]   The place where we disagree, of course, is this.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.640]   We say that the bishop is not necessary in this respect, and that this is something that
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.560]   can happen apart from him, and so on.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.400]   That is not the material point this morning.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.200]   The point I am establishing is that confirming the teaching of the New Testament, you get
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:24.320]   the early history, leading right on subsequently, showing that there is this distinction between
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.120]   these two things.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:33.860]   And therefore it seems to me that those who are in the Anglican position are in real difficulties
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.400]   about their whole service of confirmation.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.040]   Because you see, in connection with the baptism of an infant, this is what the priest has
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040]   to say.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:52.760]   "Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is by baptism regenerate and grafted
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   into the body of Christ's Church, let us give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits,"
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   and so on.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.960]   And in the service of confirmation, the same thing is repeated.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:11.680]   "Almighty and ever-living God, who hast vouchsafed to regenerate these thy servants by water
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:17.400]   and by the Holy Ghost, and hast given unto them forgiveness of all their sins, strengthen
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.520]   them," and so on.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.800]   It seems to me that if you identify belief or regeneration with the baptism of the Holy
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.440]   Spirit, there really is no point in a confirmation service.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.800]   However, that is not our problem; that is the problem of people who fall into these
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   errors.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.640]   There then is my fourth argument in this respect.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.840]   Now let me come finally to what is the most important thing of all.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.600]   And this is no longer quoting anybody or refuting error.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.960]   This is positive assertion.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.000]   This is the teaching of the New Testament itself.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.320]   To me, the ultimate, the final proof of this vital distinction between regeneration and
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.800]   the baptism of the Spirit, the teaching which says that you can be regenerate and still
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.560]   not baptized with the Spirit, the ultimate proof of this is none other than the case
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.200]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ himself.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.640]   It is interesting to notice that people who do not recognize this distinction never refer
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.760]   to him at all in this matter.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   And yet here it is.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   It is so vital.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:30.200]   That is why I read those portions of scriptures to you at the beginning this morning.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:39.840]   Here he is, the eternal Son of God, more than regenerate, the Word which always was the
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.320]   Son of God, the incarnate Son of God.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:49.080]   Here he is now as a man in the flesh.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.900]   And yet you remember what happened to him.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.720]   In order to fulfill all righteousness, as he puts it to John the Baptist, he submitted
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.460]   to baptism.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.280]   And this is what we read.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.720]   "Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus, also being baptized
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:15.380]   and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.280]   a dove upon him.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:26.720]   And a voice came from heaven which said, 'Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.'"
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.120]   And do you notice what happens after that?
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:35.920]   First verse of the fourth chapter of Luke, "And Jesus, being full of the Holy Ghost"—it
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.360]   happened when the Holy Ghost came down upon him as he was there in the Jordan.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:47.760]   "Full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness."
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.160]   And again look at the fourteenth verse, "And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   into Galilee."
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.400]   But look again at the later verses.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   He goes into the synagogue, the book of Isaiah was handed to him.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.200]   When he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, "The Spirit of
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.760]   the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor," etc.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:20.200]   Then he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.520]   Then you've got statements saying the same thing in the gospel according to John—listen
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:32.400]   to this in John 3.34, "For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.120]   For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him."
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:48.480]   God giveth the Spirit not by measure, and then the last statement is in John 6.27, "Labour
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.400]   not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.600]   life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.400]   For him hath God the Father sealed."
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.240]   You remember we had that same word last Sunday morning in Ephesians 1.13, "In whom having
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:13.280]   believed he were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise."
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.680]   God the Father hath sealed the Son, and he sealed him at the Jordan when he sent the
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   Holy Ghost upon him.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.440]   He there received the Spirit in fullness.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.440]   What for?
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.000]   Here is the crucial point.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.560]   Our Lord is there beginning to enter on his public ministry.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.080]   He had lived as a man, he had worked as a carpenter, but now at the age of thirty he
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.720]   sets out in his ministry.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:49.240]   And here is the teaching, "Because he had become a man and was living life in this world
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:57.680]   as a man, though he is still the eternal Son of God, he needs to receive the Spirit in
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.240]   his fullness."
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.000]   And God gave him the Spirit.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.640]   The Spirit descended upon him.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.280]   So then we read of him that filled with the Spirit he goes, in the power of the Spirit
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.400]   he begins to preach.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.880]   He says, "I have been anointed with the Spirit in order to proclaim."
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:18.360]   In other words, our Lord himself could not act as witness and as preacher and as testifier
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:25.280]   to the gospel of salvation without receiving this endowment of the Spirit.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.920]   And that, I hope to be able to show you, is the purpose of the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.640]   Now, but you see the argument.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.520]   Our Lord is eternally the Son of God.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:48.080]   But though he is the Son of God, to do his work as the Messiah in the likeness of man
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:55.760]   in the form of a servant, he needs this baptism with the Spirit.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.920]   And so the Spirit came upon him, even as it came upon the disciples and the hundred and
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.160]   twenty in the upper room, even as it came upon Cornelius and his household, even as
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.120]   it comes upon people in every time of revival.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.840]   And in the power of the Spirit he is enabled.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:18.760]   We are told that he spoke in the power of the Spirit, he lived in the power of the Spirit,
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:24.840]   he died through the power of the eternal Spirit, he rose from the dead through the power of
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.840]   the Spirit.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:33.560]   Here, you see, then is established beyond any dispute or doubt whatsoever this essential
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   distinction between regeneration, being born again, being a partaker of the divine nature,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.240]   and the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.400]   Not only do you get into the difficulties I have been trying to illustrate this morning,
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:59.080]   if you do not recognize these distinctions, above all, you find yourself in a position
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:06.360]   in which you simply cannot explain what we read of as having taken place in the case
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.800]   of our blessed Lord and Saviour himself.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:16.240]   Now, having cleared these matters, I trust God willing, next Sunday morning and on subsequent
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:26.600]   mornings, to describe to you what this is, what it means, and after that, how this blessing
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:38.800]   is to be obtained.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:46.280]   The closing hymn is hymn number 200, "Create a Spirit by whose aid the world's foundations
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.800]   first were laid."
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   Hymn number 200.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   [MUSIC - "CREATE A SPIRIT BY WHOSE AID THE WORLD'S FOUNDATIONS FIRST WERE LAID"]
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   [MUSIC - "CREATE A SPIRIT BY WHOSE AID THE WORLD'S FOUNDATIONS FIRST WERE LAID"]
