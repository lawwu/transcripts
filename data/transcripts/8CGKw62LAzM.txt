[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660]   Alright, everybody, welcome back to the number one science,
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.200]   politics, technology and business podcast in the world
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.720]   for five years running. We're about to hit our fourth
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.420]   anniversary here, episode 200 is coming up. And a bunch of
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.240]   lunatic fans are getting together, you can join them all
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.160]   in.com slash meetups. Holy cow, we got the domain name all in.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.840]   Fantastic. Go to all in.com slash meetups. And hey,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.480]   subscribe to our YouTube channel, we're going to do some
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.640]   sort of crazy event for the million subscriber party. We're
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320]   like 300,000 way gentlemen. This is nuts, huh? Can you imagine
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.040]   this thing made it to 200 episodes? We have all in.com How
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.560]   much do we spend on this? This is great. I negotiated it. I got
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.760]   it. It took me two years. And I got a sick deal on it. I don't
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   even want to say because I you know, I don't want to change it.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   But I think I got it. Don't say I'll just say you believe it. I
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.120]   got it for or so. And that's a million dollar domain, just so
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.400]   we all know five letters in the dictionary. So good for
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.840]   branding. Good job, Jake. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, now we
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.280]   have all in.com slash tequila. Oh, I love it. Exactly. Exactly.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.880]   And you can yum yum. I got you sacks.com didn't know you have
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.160]   the domain name. So yeah, I'm gonna go share that for you.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.720]   Wow, we have all the way back to episode one. This is
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.600]   incredible. Oh, the new website. Yeah, this is great. Oh, can I
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.240]   tell you if I all in.com all in.com that's our website. It's
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.600]   like this thing is real. Yeah, it's like a real thing. After
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.080]   four years, we got our together. This is great. Here we go. And I
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.760]   want to give a shout out to podcast AI one of our member
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.000]   those fake all in episodes that became a startup podcast AI and
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.960]   they built our website for us. So shout out to the team over
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.760]   there. All right, ladies, let's move on. And I am of course,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.480]   your executive producer for life, and the moderator. And if
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.840]   I may, just a tiny plug. If you're a founder, we are having
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560]   our ninth cohort of Foundry University. It's a 12 week
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   course I teach on starting companies. I'm just giving a
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.480]   quick plug for Foundry University because I want to go
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.120]   to one and buy super good bars 399. You can pick them up this
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.600]   afternoon.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.760]   Let your winners ride brain man David Sacks.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:37.960]   Speaking of that, your people use me in an ad reberg. So don't
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.080]   talk about plugs.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.880]   A few weeks ago when I shouted out that glue AI was hiring
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.360]   engineers, we had like 100 applications just from that.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.560]   From looking for engineers like on the show. Yeah. For glue AI.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.160]   Yeah. Right. That's awesome for glue AI. And if you haven't
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.000]   tried super got free birds team literally made an advertisement
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.440]   with me talking about super got it didn't tell me and we're still
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.720]   hiring. So okay, well, there you have it. So go to founder dot
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.800]   university to apply for my 12 week program. I'm running a go
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.920]   fund me. Yeah, go to go fund me. So I remember for what's more
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.960]   more Xanax to deal with your panic attacks. All right, let's
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.600]   get started. Enough of the shenanigans hurricane season is
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   upon us as free bird have predicted Hurricane Milton made
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.400]   land fall on Wednesday evening, along the west coast of Florida
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.000]   as many of you know, it's been downgraded. It started as a
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.160]   category five potentially than a category three and then it looks
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.720]   like it's a category one now. So I guess these things are quite
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   random. Leading up to Milton, those 6 million Floridians
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.400]   across 15 counties were ordered to evacuate. That's a lot of
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.160]   people moving out. And it was a pretty powerful storm. It ripped
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.760]   off the roof of the Tropicana field in Tampa. So far, the
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.080]   death toll is at four, but it's expected to rise sadly. And just
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.560]   two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene swept through six southern
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.120]   states killing over 220 people tragically devastating western
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.160]   North Carolina and entire towns were wiped out. These are also
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.240]   beyond the tragic human losses are economically staggering. In
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.800]   terms of the losses, Accuweather estimating the total economic
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   damage could be between 145 and 160 billion propellant and Moody
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   estimates the property damage alone could be as high as 26
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.320]   billion tons to get into here FEMA starling saving the day
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.600]   tons of stuff. But freeberg back on Episode 182, you predicted
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.840]   this would happen. What's causing all this? And let's just
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.880]   start with the science angle, I guess, before we get into the
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   other political and insurance issues.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.720]   Well, I think if you'll remember, when we talked about
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.840]   this a couple months ago, the sea surface temperature was at
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.920]   kind of a record high in the Atlantic. And warm ocean
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.200]   temperatures, drive moist air up that evaporates, the warmer the
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.160]   air, the faster the evaporation, and that starts to cause the
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.720]   movement of the air, which drives ultimately the hurricane,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.320]   and then the hurricane sucks up more warm, moist air from the
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.920]   ocean, and it creates a feedback loop. So the more energy you
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.360]   have in the ocean, the more likely you are to accelerate
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.040]   wind forces in storms. And that's why you get these massive
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.320]   hurricanes that suddenly form seemingly overnight, and go like
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.360]   in the case of Helene, that hurricane went from a cat to to
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.280]   a cat four or cat five in like 48 hours. Because of the energy
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.320]   that's sort of a 90%. Here's an interesting stat 90% of the
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.080]   energy that we get from the sun is absorbed and stored in our
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.680]   oceans. The other kind of fact that's playing into this if you
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.440]   pull up that science that nature article, and this is something
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.120]   that I think you guys may remember we talked about. So
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.760]   this was an article that came out a paper science paper that
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.480]   came out a couple of months ago. And in this paper, the
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.440]   scientists identified that removing sulfur dioxide from
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.880]   cargo ships that travel across the oceans is actually causing
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.280]   accelerated warming in the oceans. And the reason is that
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   the sulfur dioxide forms cloud formations, and those clouds,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.120]   they travel across the oceans, and those cloud formations
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.200]   reflect sunlight. And in the absence of those cloud
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.400]   formations, that sunlight makes its way into the ocean, and you
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.440]   get more ocean warming. And by their estimation, removing
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.240]   sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and that's the reason
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.200]   it's been pushed to be removed. And they started removing it in
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.640]   2020 2021. From cargo vessels by removing sulfur dioxide, we are
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.440]   now going to see a doubling of the rate of warming of the
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.840]   oceans in the 2020s. And going forward,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.640]   let me pause there for a second, just to make sure people
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   understand what you're saying emissions from cargo ships
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.760]   block sunlight, which then of course, reduces the heat
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.880]   absorbed by the oceans. And so we're now choosing between
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.440]   pollution of the air, or overheating of the oceans. Am I
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.720]   correct in summarizing that?
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.560]   That's roughly it. And
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.040]   what is the pollution again? Sorry, I just saw
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.600]   it's a mission oxide. Yeah, that goes into the fuel of cargo
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.120]   vessels. And a couple of years ago, they started to implement
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.960]   these mandates that sulfur dioxide no longer be used in the
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.440]   fuel. As a result, when sulfur dioxide is emitted from these
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.600]   vessels, it goes into the atmosphere. And it actually
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.840]   triggers cloud formation. So now you have these clouds that are
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.320]   forming. And Nick's gonna pull up this image right now. Yeah,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.160]   here you can see that. So all of these tracks are these cargo
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.520]   vessels moving across the ocean. And as they move across the
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.120]   ocean, they create cloud cover, cloud cover actually reduces the
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.080]   warming in the ocean because it reflects sunlight. So now that
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   sunlight energy gets absorbed into the ocean. So this is
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.760]   another driving force that some people are now speculating,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.920]   maybe accelerating the warming of the oceans that we're seeing,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.400]   which drives these extreme storm and hurricane events. And so
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.600]   this becomes a more frequent event. Now, a lot of people
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.160]   sorry, can I ask you a question? Does that mean that we're mean
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.560]   reverting? Meaning? If we improve the quality of the fuel
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.440]   source that are used in shipping? Doesn't that then mean
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.080]   that we're reverting back to what would have happened in the
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.040]   absence of these dirty fuel sources? Yeah. So in addition,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.880]   no, no, I'm asking, I'm asking you the question. Is that true?
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.120]   Or not? So, yes, we are no longer reflecting as much
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.440]   sunlight. And so for several decades, we had bad fuel. So we
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.160]   had artificial cooling, we had an artificial cooling. And now
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.960]   we take but that's counter to the narrative of what we all
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.360]   think is happening. Oh, well, the argument is that we've
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.880]   actually been warming the atmosphere, which we have been
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.360]   we can see the data that shows that everywhere all over the
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.040]   earth, not just about sunlight coming in on the oceans, and not
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.640]   just ocean warming. But the the atmosphere is warming, the
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.120]   planet is warming. And so this is by by blocking the sunlight
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.000]   above the oceans, we were artificially dampening that
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.120]   effect. And we were reducing the amount of heat energy that was
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.280]   getting into the oceans. So now by taking that away, we're
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.200]   seeing the heat energy in the oceans accelerate. And now the
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.600]   oceans are getting much, much warmer.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.240]   Right? So the pollution was good.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   Turns out, it was a paradox here, is that it was creating a
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.560]   blocker for sunlight. And to your point, Chamath, exactly
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.600]   like, shouldn't we just be going back to what was normal, but at
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   the same time, in the same system, we had heated things up.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.080]   So this is a multi factored system that we're dealing with
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.680]   Friedberg. And I guess the takeaway from all of this is
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.600]   that we got to be really careful with what we do with the
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.360]   environment, right?
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.440]   Well, I mean, let's talk about economics, right? So what, how
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.120]   much real estate do you guys think is on the Florida coastline?
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.800]   What's the real estate value?
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.440]   Sorry, Friedberg, can you just anchor this like, was it that it
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.480]   was supposed to be a category five, and now it's a category
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.680]   three when it hit land?
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.200]   Right. So what happens typically, when storms hit land
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.360]   is they no longer have that hot ocean pumping energy back into
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.080]   the storm that keeps the feedback loop going. So the
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.480]   storm cycle starts to break down all hurricanes, when they hit
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.440]   land, they start to break apart. And so the category, which
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.680]   measures the wind speed actually reduces, this is just a natural
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.320]   thing that happens. But this was a category five hurricane, when
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.640]   it made landfall, I believe it was category four. So, you know,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.200]   it was a massive hurricane.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.080]   We should not dismiss it, because my understanding was
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:41.160]   Helen was cat four, when it like hit North Carolina. But I read
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.920]   yesterday that
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.200]   what happened, yeah, what happened with Helen was it was
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.920]   cat four
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.520]   is cat three when it hit Tampa or something. Is that not?
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.320]   Yeah, yeah. So that's right. But what happened when Helene hit
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.200]   North Carolina was not a cat four. What happened is, as that
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.000]   storm moved inland, it hit the mountains and the first mountains
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.600]   it hit are on Western North Carolina, that area is elevated,
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.480]   there's mountains there. So when a heavy hot storm runs into cold
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.800]   mountains, all the moisture dumps out, it's like it runs into it.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.120]   And suddenly everything precipitates out of that storm.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.760]   And that's why some parts of Western North Carolina got like
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.440]   18. Some high, some people measured as high as 30 inches of
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.040]   rainfall in a couple of hours. So this insane dumping happens
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.200]   when that hot air hits cold, it hits a cold region. And suddenly
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.640]   everything all that warm moisture precipitates out and
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.160]   dumps to the ground. So it ran into a mountain. It's
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.600]   effectively why everything fell out in North Carolina.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.160]   Right. So you're saying that it wasn't Democrats who basically
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.760]   right?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.840]   Nancy Pelosi cast a spell or something.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.920]   Yeah, well, isn't there a lot of geoengineering conspiracy
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.600]   theories going on in your cohort? I mean, what's
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.720]   I don't think so. But the node wants us to be very clear that
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.680]   we need to, we need to stop all this disinformation that somehow
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.720]   Democrats were behind that storm. Well, there are we can
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.120]   assure everyone that it was just a lot of online that there's a
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.600]   ton of lazy geoengineering being run by government agencies to
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.360]   drive these people aren't taking that seriously.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.160]   Well, I mean, the the origin of this, though, free bird is
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.840]   people have done experiments for decades on trying to control the
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.920]   weather or, you know, alter the weather. And they're doing that
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.480]   in the Middle East by seeding clouds and creating more rain.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.240]   We saw that with the Dubai floods, they said that that
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.080]   might have been caused by overseeding of clouds, which
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.440]   they're doing there. And then there have been experiments,
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.600]   just to, you know, for the crazy laser people conspiracy there,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.880]   it's there are some x, there actually have been experiments
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.680]   with lasers, you know, being shot into hurricanes and storms,
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.200]   correct?
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.760]   Are you Alex Jones? Is that what we're doing? Well, no, we're
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.560]   not saying Alex Jones, but I'm just saying that's the origin of
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.360]   where people are kind of building on this. There have
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.920]   been the amount. Okay, so so let's just talk about the
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.120]   hurricane, the amount of
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.600]   teeing it up for you to debunk is what I'm doing here. Yeah.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.040]   Putting particulates in clouds to accelerate precipitation is I
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.840]   mean, we've done that for 100 years, you know, you can do, you
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.000]   can increase the precipitation rate when there's already clouds
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.600]   that have formed. But that has nothing to do with creating 200
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.320]   mile an hour wind speed, that requires an extraordinary amount
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.760]   of energy, all of this energy that the oceans are like giant
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.720]   giant batteries. And when a hurricane gets going, that
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.440]   battery is accelerating the hurricane and the hurricane
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.080]   sucks up more power from the battery. And it creates this
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.120]   incredibly dynamical system, there is no human created energy
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.800]   system that can force form a hurricane. A hurricane is an
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.600]   extraordinarily powerful natural phenomenon that arises from the
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.480]   amount of energy that can come out of very, very, very hot
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.680]   oceans, relatively speaking. So you know, that's really where
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.760]   these hurricanes are coming from. Now, they're going to be
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.600]   more frequent if the ocean temperatures remain elevated as
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.640]   they seem to be, and continue to be elevated. And this can be a
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.440]   function of generally, the temperatures warming on Earth,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.640]   generally, the removal of sulfur dioxide, generally, these El
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.400]   Nino La Nina cycles, there's a lot of factors, but it seems to
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.160]   be the case that we are having a very significant trend of
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.440]   continuously warmer oceans. And those continuously warmer oceans
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.720]   means that we're going to have what used to be called a one in
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.000]   500 year storm, which is what Asheville is being termed at one
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.720]   in 500 year, these sorts of storm events can happen every
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.480]   couple years. And we're now looking at one in 100 year
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.400]   events happening every two to three years, in the United
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.080]   States with the the hurricane activity that we've been seeing,
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.960]   I think a lot of the conspiracy theories are built on actual
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   experiments that happened this one project storm fury, I'm sure
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   you know, about was to try to modify hurricanes by putting in
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.160]   some chemicals that would freeze them and dull them. So they're
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.520]   kind of building break it apart. Yeah, break it apart. So, you
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.000]   know, there, there, there have been experiments here with
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.800]   altering weather, altering hurricanes, but that doesn't
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.560]   mean it's Putin Pelosi, or, you know, the Illuminati. So let's
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.320]   let's get back to brass tacks. So yeah, let's talk about the
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.000]   economics. So there's, there's 500 billion to a trillion
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.600]   dollars of real estate value on the Florida coastline. And what
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.760]   used to be a one in 100 year event, the average Florida
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.200]   homeowner historically has been paying about 1% of the real
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.760]   estate value and insurance. So now if your real estate is
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.040]   likely to be wiped out, one out of every 20 years, instead of
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.720]   one out of every 500 years, the cost of insurance gets to the
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.680]   point that it is untenable for most people to pay for their
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.600]   insurance. Florida has a state backed reinsurance provider
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.640]   called the Florida hurricane catastrophe front fund. And this
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.440]   fund issues debt to meet its coverage demands because it
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.360]   reinsures insurance companies in order to incentivize them to
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.040]   come into the state and under you should explain the loop
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.560]   here, which is you go and get a mortgage. The bank says you need
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.280]   to get insurance if I'm going to lend you the money to buy the
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.120]   home. So then a bunch of insurers need to decide that
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.960]   they're willing to underwrite that area. And then when they
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.600]   give you that insurance, they then want to lay that risk off
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.520]   and go to reinsure. Is that the cycle?
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.600]   That's right. And what's happening is they would normally
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.800]   underwrite that risk, they would say this is going to cost,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.400]   you're going to lose the value of your home every 100 years or
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.680]   every 200 years. But now, the models are showing because of
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.080]   the frequency of these sorts of hurricane events and the
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.720]   severity of the hurricane events, that maybe you'll lose
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.280]   the value of your home once every 20 years or once every 30
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.320]   years. And no consumer is going to be willing or able to pay
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.920]   that much for the insurance on their home. So the state over
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.800]   the last several years has had to step in and effectively
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.880]   subsidize the insurance. And now the state reinsurance vehicle
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.520]   only has statutory liability maximum of $17 billion in a
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.400]   single hurricane season. Now, I think they got lucky with
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.960]   Milton today, but some were estimating that the Milton
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.360]   losses were going to be in excess of 100 billion bigger
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.760]   than Katrina. It's likely as of this morning, the reinsurance
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.400]   websites are all saying it's probably a 40 to $50 billion
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.520]   loss event, which still exceeds the state's reinsurance
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.960]   capacity. So you can kind of think about Florida state's
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.360]   reinsurance thing being effectively bankrupt, it
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.440]   doesn't really have the capacity to underwrite the insurance
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.680]   anymore. So the real question for everyone is, is the federal
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.800]   government going to have to step in and start to support the
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.960]   price of homes? Because if they don't, well, it's a terrible
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.160]   precedent to set, because if you do it for Florida, then you'll
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.720]   have to do it in Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.480]   California with wildfires, Arizona, there's there and Texas,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.160]   there's going to be no way to create a clear demarcation of
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.600]   who gets a bailout and who doesn't win, which which will
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.200]   mean that everybody will get a bailout, or nobody gets a
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.120]   bailout. That's right. And if everybody gets a bailout, and if
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.600]   you think about how systematically unpredictable,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.000]   at least in the southern states, the weather is you're going to
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.360]   be talking hundreds of billions of dollars a year, probably, the
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.240]   total value of all mortgages and home homeowner mortgages in
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.080]   Florida is $454 billion. And those people typically have, you
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.440]   know, a debt to equity ratio, probably on the 50 to 80% range.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.800]   So if the value of your home dips by 25%, because everyone
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.680]   starts selling their homes leaving Florida, or they can't
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.800]   get insurance, then the people that live in Florida, most of
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.160]   them have their network tied up in their home, are going to see
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.600]   their personal net worth wiped out or cut in half. So it's not
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.720]   just an economic problem, it's a social problem, that now there
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.080]   are so many people that have put their entire net worth into
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.920]   their home, the value of their home is written to a point that
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.240]   it no longer makes sense, given the frequency at which homes
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.560]   are going to get destroyed.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.960]   That's probably the reason why they'll have to do it because
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.680]   they'll actually, but then that calculation will have to happen
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.280]   for every single homeowner in every single state at where this
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.400]   is a this is an issue.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.800]   Yeah, wait, free bear, are you saying the entire Florida coast
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.000]   line is no longer economically viable?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.040]   No, it's totally viable. It's just the question is, what are
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.560]   you willing to price? At what price? Will you pay 5% of your
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.040]   home value for insurance every year? You know, when you pay 2%
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.600]   3%
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.880]   if the expected life of a house is 20 years, then no, that's not
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   that's not viable.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.560]   It becomes very, very untenable.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.640]   Well, it used to be one in 500 year now.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.280]   Does this apply to the entire coastline or just parts of it?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.240]   Well, I mean, you saw that the range at which these events can
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.880]   happen is all over the place. And the and the challenges the
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.560]   events are getting more significant.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.000]   Because of this warm ocean weather that we see this warm
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.760]   ocean temperature, so we're gonna see more is free bird is
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.040]   that now people are building the first couple of floors in high
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.000]   rises in Miami, and homes on stilts with concrete, and with
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.720]   resistant, you know, saltwater resistant material. So there is
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.640]   a counter to this. So we might be looking at investment in
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.240]   climate resilience. That's right. Yeah. So
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.320]   it might actually be an opportunity to upgrade all these
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.240]   homes to resistant ones using another set of technologies. But
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.000]   the bailout is really interesting to sacks, because
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.240]   Florence got a lot of electoral college votes, doesn't it? Like,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.720]   I hate to bring this back to politics. But, you know,
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.800]   promising people bailouts is how these politicians seem to be
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.640]   getting votes.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.200]   These days. And is anyone talking about a federal bailout?
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.160]   Is that this is something you're
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.600]   I think what free brick is saying is that there's a there's
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.920]   a pretty obvious parade of parables here where the question
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.080]   will have to be answered one way or the other. Because if you
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.120]   only have a $17 billion reinsurance fund, and there's
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.480]   50 billion of damage, somebody is going to have to come in and
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.000]   cover the gap. And if it's the insurance companies, expect your
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   insurance premiums to double or triple.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.360]   That's right. And that's what happened in California. And by
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.600]   the way, State State Farm left a lot of California.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.720]   This is what I was gonna say. Most of these big insurance
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   companies have already done the calculus to realize that these
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.040]   regions are no longer profitable enough to justify the downside
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.200]   risk. 100% bigger problem. So then the ones that are left are
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.560]   insolvent reinsurers or insurers that are just funding short term
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.000]   ARBs because they know that the odds are they're going to get
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.920]   wiped out. So they'll price gouge effectively. So, you know, a
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.120]   different example is that here where I live in Menlo Park,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.360]   we're not in a floodplain. We're not in a fire region, none of
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.280]   that stuff. But in order for us to get home insurance, you have
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.040]   to now go through a risk assessment. And in our specific
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.720]   case, we were like, hey, what should we do with our roof? And
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.320]   they were like, you got to take the roof off if you want home
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.080]   insurance. We're like, well, home insurance is probably a
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.760]   good thing to have.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.600]   Was it a wood shake roof on your house?
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.760]   It was a beautiful, you saw our house, it's a beautiful wood
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.760]   shake roof, and we had to remove it. And the two choices were a
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.400]   $350,000 like iron composite materials. Yeah. Or, or like 70k
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.520]   for composite. And it's like, this is insane. And the cost of
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.160]   insurance was just egregious in the absence of going in one
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.400]   anyways, we ended up getting the
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   for most homeowners, when the cost of insurance gets to a
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.760]   certain threshold, you don't have budget for it, you can't
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.040]   afford it. And so that's a lot of why the insurers leave,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.080]   they'll underwrite anything at any price, but they just know
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.880]   that most consumers can't afford it. Here's some other
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.120]   interesting statistics, related but unrelated. In the early
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.520]   1900s, the city of Phoenix, Arizona averaged five days a
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.600]   year of temperatures of 110 degrees or warmer. By the 2010s
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:09.040]   Phoenix averaged during the 2010s 27 days a year, or the
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.720]   temperature was 110 or higher. Since 2021. Phoenix average
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.560]   hundred plus days 42 days, and in 2024. It's been 70 days so
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.920]   far this year, that the temperature is over 110. So this
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   is affecting and so there's there's increased risks in
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.360]   California with wildfires increased risk with hurricane,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.720]   there are a lot of these factors. And I have friends that
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.200]   work in reinsurance and in the insurance markets.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.880]   Even even if you don't get affected by a wildfire or
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.520]   disaster, when that that article was in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.320]   it I think it said that the number of average days above 100
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.600]   was like 100 something. Yes. And, and the profile, they
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.880]   profile this retired woman who is an insurance adjuster or
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.000]   something. And the whole point of the article was not that her
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.480]   her house was destroyed or at risk, but the cost of
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.920]   electricity has gone just absolutely sky. Yeah. Even with
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.200]   solar panels, even with storage, you need to basically lean on
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.360]   the grid. And the grid now just charges you an exorbitant amount
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.240]   of money. And so these, these folks are paying 1000s of
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.400]   dollars a year. So if you imagine the trifecta, you have
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.920]   all of this climate risk that could destroy your home, you're
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.880]   paying an enormous premium for home insurance, and then you're
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.600]   paying an enormous premium for electricity from the mainline
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.800]   power utilities. It's it's not sustainable. Yeah.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.440]   And just for background, FEMA manages something called the NF
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.480]   IP national flood insurance plan. And it's historically
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.720]   about 50% cheaper than private flood insurance. They have 4.7
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.040]   million active policies providing 1.3 trillion in
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.200]   coverage. But they instituted a new risk assessment system and
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.960]   that caused rates to increase. And yeah, it's because of all
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.520]   this, the policies have decreased over the last couple
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.400]   of years, meaning less people have flood insurance at the same
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.520]   time that these things are getting worse. And so, yeah,
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.720]   this is a really tough issue. I wonder if this is an
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.200]   opportunity tomorrow. If you think about historically how
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.000]   insurance worked, it worked in communities where people would
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   help each other out to barn raising kind of events when
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.880]   somebody had a problem. So if we just put on our entrepreneurial
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.880]   hats here, if you look at the cost of insurance, if 100
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.880]   different people bundle the cost of their homes together, put
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.520]   money into some sort of platform, like an Uber, Airbnb
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.360]   marketplace, and there was some management structure here of
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.520]   self insurance, because I know some people are doing self
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.800]   insurance for healthcare at their companies for this kind of
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.560]   thing. Do you think there's going to be a new business
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.480]   opportunity here?
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.120]   That's called Jason, it's called a mutual. And those are
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.640]   like a good chunk of the industry are mutuals, where it's
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.040]   the shareholders are the members and they all share the risk and
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.520]   the ownership.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.160]   Those problem is those things work because you have broad
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   geographic coverage. If you had to go just into Malibu and
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.080]   self insure, the rates would literally be greater than the
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.200]   value of the home, right? No one would pay into it. So if you do
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.400]   proper underwriting, what's happened in the last couple of
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.560]   years is all the reinsurance companies and all the insurance
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.400]   companies have had to re underwrite the rates that they
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.720]   charge for insurance, because the frequency of a disaster has
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.560]   gone up. And the new price that they should be charging is so
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.520]   high, it doesn't matter how the capital structure is set up. It
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.720]   simply, there's, there's one big event that's going to cause a
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.000]   big wipeout for a large number.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.480]   My personal belief is I think that the real estate markets in
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.160]   some of these places are meaningfully mispriced. And
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.080]   specifically, what I mean is that they're massively
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.320]   overpriced. That's right. Because I think when you
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.360]   actually account for the climate damage and the long term
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.080]   financial stability of the insurers and the reinsurers, I
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   don't think that many of the markets that have seen these
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.320]   crazy sky high prices, I'll name two to be specific, West Palm
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.920]   Beach, and Malibu. So both ends of the coasts, these things just
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   don't make sense. And I think people view these things as
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   investments. But on the West Coast, when you deal with things
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.360]   like soil erosion and other things, I think it's a there's
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.120]   it's a calamity waiting to happen. And I think on the East
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.200]   Coast, when you factor in the extreme weather conditions, even
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.120]   Jason, your comment about rebuilding these homes in a more
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.440]   foolproof way doesn't solve it, because you won't be able to
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.040]   rebuild the entire state. There's a lot of people that
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.480]   just can't afford it. There's a lot of folks that will not have
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.600]   adequate coverage. So I just think these are disasters
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.920]   waiting to happen, unfortunately.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:49.760]   Yeah, it's, in fact, there's a movement right now. A lot of
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.280]   people even have means are renting their homes. And so in
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.720]   the real estate market, what are your thoughts on that just
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.360]   renting versus buying now becoming like a something that,
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.440]   you know, people in the in the top half of homeowners or
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.080]   potential homeowners are now electing to not own their home
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.040]   and rent? Have you been monitoring?
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.760]   I hadn't heard that. I mean, the trend that I thought was
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.880]   happening was that you had these big funds, like BlackRock,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.480]   whatever, buying up huge numbers of homes, and then running them
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.440]   to low end homes, you know, low end or medium, you know, to
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.040]   families, I thought that's what was going on. I hadn't heard
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.160]   that at the high end of the range that people were
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.280]   running. Well, if you think about it, like there's, there
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.000]   seems to be a cap when you have a $10 million home of what you
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.840]   can possibly rent it for. And it's, it's the the prices are
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.920]   now making more sense to keep more sense to keep your money in
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.960]   the market, or in other places, and then rent. I'm just here.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.720]   Are you long real estate in Florida or coastal California if
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.400]   you could? Or do you treat them differently?
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.840]   I think they're different. But Florida is like, I mean, I don't
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.360]   know how you do the math on. I just don't know what you do on a
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.400]   trillion dollars, a real estate value with half a trillion of
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:11.240]   mortgages. When you have real exposure on loss more frequently
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.080]   than one in 100 years, they're to your point, they need to be
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.360]   repriced. And how do you reprice those homes in the significant
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.240]   level that they need to be repriced without causing massive
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.360]   economic and social consequence? That's what's, that's what's
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.640]   kind of, I think, challenging me and thinking about what's the
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.800]   path here. So it was a good thing that I sold my Miami
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.320]   place.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.560]   Once again, Zach, it's a great trade. Pretty awesome. Well done
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:42.120]   sex. Again, well done. sexy. Just like I love I love that
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.840]   house on the house. Where do you think I stayed when I was in
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.520]   town? Yeah, you're so selfish. I lost the place to stay. I mean,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.440]   the yacht access alone, being able to get out on the bay and
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.360]   get on a boat and the ski booze all this great stuff. All right,
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.560]   let's let's keep the free bird train going here. Huge news
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.680]   alpha fold creators just won a Nobel Prize in chemistry. Two
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.600]   members of Google's DeepMind AI research team. Demis Hassabis
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.200]   and john jumper received this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.480]   They both work for Google's DeepMind as you know, and free
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.160]   Berg again, Paul and getting their first explained what alpha
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:30.000]   fold was back on episode 14. In December of 2020. That was
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.320]   almost four years ago. free bird, maybe you could explain
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.280]   did we did we predict that they would win the Nobel Prize? I
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.160]   believe you did. And we'll go check the receipts using
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.760]   searching. It was it became it became much more likely that
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.680]   they would win the Nobel after they won the Breakthrough Prize.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.600]   I mean, just to just to point this out. But yeah, yeah.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.360]   Shout out your email, shout out Uri and Julia and Julia. Because
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:02.320]   when those guys won that award for 2023 and you heard the
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.520]   extent of what they've done, it was almost like obvious that
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.400]   they were going to win Nobel after the fact. So I think the
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.640]   really interesting thing is actually, in this community, I
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.080]   think the Breakthrough Prize is actually meaningfully more
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.800]   relevant, and a positive directional indicator to
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.840]   Breakthrough Science. Well, it's kind of like winning Sundance,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.040]   or can you win the Palme d'Or, you become a favorite to win at
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.280]   the Oscars, right in the Academy Awards. So that's actually
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.280]   interesting, the regional or more industry centric award
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.800]   could lead to the next one. So free bird, just explain to us
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.160]   why this is so important. I just think it's much more rigorous
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.360]   than the Nobel. I think the Nobel can be a little bit
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.960]   gained, I think. Oh, interesting. Okay. What do you
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.560]   think free bird explain to the audience why this is important
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.680]   and what's transpired since we talked about it four years ago?
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.440]   There's been a long
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:57.080]   challenge in biochemistry on understanding, or predicting or
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.560]   visualizing the three dimensional structure of
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.160]   proteins, because remember, proteins are produced by long
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.360]   chains of amino acids. And those amino acids are kind of create
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.200]   like a bead, beaded necklace, and then the whole necklace
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.720]   collapses on itself in a very specific way. And that three
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   dimensional molecule, that big chunky protein does something
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.600]   structurally physically. And so trying to understand the shape
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.200]   of a protein is really hard. I mean, we've used kind of x ray
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.960]   imaging systems to try and identify it and try to build
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.400]   models to identify how does that quote protein folding work? How
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.200]   do those amino acids collapse on each other to create that three
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.240]   dimensional construct? And if I don't know if you guys remember
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.840]   in the early 2000s, there was a Stanford folding at home
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.440]   distributed computing project. You guys remember this? Yeah, it
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.800]   would use people's machines and extra CPU, like the steady at
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.160]   home project to precisely Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. So it's
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.520]   like it ran on the background of your computer, use your CPU
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.280]   cycles when you weren't using your computer. And it tried to
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.600]   model protein folding. And so this has been a problem that
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.960]   folks have tried to tackle with compute for decades to figure
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.480]   out the 3d structure. This is so important, because if we can
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.880]   identify the 3d structure of proteins, and we can predict
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.800]   them from the amino acid sequence, we can print out a
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.440]   sequence of amino acids to make a protein that does a specific
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.200]   thing for us. And that unlocks this ability for humans to
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.760]   create biomolecules that can do everything from binding cancer
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.120]   to breaking apart pollutants and plastics, to, you know, creating
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.560]   entirely new molecules to running in some cases, like what
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.800]   David Baker did at University of Washington, he shared the Nobel
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.440]   Prize, creating micro motors, mini motors, from proteins that
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.360]   he designed on a computer. And so this becomes, I think, this
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   great, like big Holy Grail in biochemistry, and the alpha fold
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.280]   project at DeepMind inside of Google solve this problem. And
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.000]   by the way, since since then, they've come out with alpha
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.720]   fold three, yeah, they've launched a drug discovery
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.000]   company called isomorphic labs, where they're basically
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.520]   predicting molecules that will do specific things for a target
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.440]   indication. And then they use the alpha fold models to
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.160]   actually design and develop those molecules. And there have
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.800]   been literally dozens of companies that have been
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.080]   started since DeepMind was published, and probably several
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.120]   billion dollars of capital that's gone into companies that
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.320]   are creating new drugs, creating new industrial biotech
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.920]   applications, using this protein modeling capability that was
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.720]   unleashed with DeepMind a number of years ago. So it really has
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.280]   transformed the industry. It'll be a couple years before we see
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.640]   it transform the world. But it's it's it's an exciting kind of
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.280]   thing. Yeah,
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.880]   not to virtue signal here. But those are plus size proteins.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.920]   Now, Freebird, they don't like being called chunky, plus size
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.320]   proteins. Yes. One, one really difficult technical question for
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.360]   your free bird. Is there any way for you to take this amazing
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.400]   breakthrough and make sacks interested in? Is there any
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.560]   possible vector here for it to relate to sacks and get him off
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.320]   his BlackBerry right now? BlackBerry, I think he's playing
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.440]   chess with Teal and JD Vance is watching them play chess. I
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.160]   think that's what's going on right now. It's really hard. I
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.400]   mean, the audience here is watching sacks. All right, let's
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.960]   keep this train moving here enough of the shenanigans.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.400]   Anyway, congrats to the teams, the very
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   grass, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's just great. And David Baker at
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.680]   the Baker lab and University of Washington. David, they're also
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.360]   a breakthrough prize winner. Yeah. What's interesting to me
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.000]   is like these two Nobels, these guys, but also Geoffrey
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.880]   Hinton's. You know, you're really seeing now, the
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.000]   convergence of the hard sciences and computer science
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.280]   totally in a really meaningful way. And I think that that's so
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.640]   interesting and cool. I think in the group chat, Chamath, you had
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   an interesting Hey, maybe there should be a computer science
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.880]   award for, you know, a Nobel Computer Science Award. And I
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.120]   actually think it's the opposite now, which is that it's amazing
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.840]   to see folks using computers to improve our understanding of the
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.520]   natural sciences. And I think that that's a really great place
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.040]   to be. So what Dennis and john and David are doing in the life
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.000]   science is amazing, what Geoffrey Hinton, you know, did,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.520]   you know, 30 and 40 years ago, and 20 years ago, in terms of
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.920]   training deep neural nets, also really amazing. In related
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.560]   computers. Yeah, all computer based. And in related news,
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.480]   Benioff just nominated himself for excellence in CRM
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.160]   management. So congratulations to Benioff on himself.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.720]   What does that call?
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.160]   Why are you attacking Benioff?
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:39.800]   They're just jokes. Have you not learned anything?
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.000]   To people that attack you, it's not an attack. It's a joke has
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.160]   done so much for philanthropy. Just ask him. If you
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:57.120]   what are you doing? Exactly? People have a sense of humor
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.680]   about yourself. But it's not even it's not even funny. If you
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.120]   had said something else.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.760]   I mean, okay, give me a give me a funnier Nobel. Go ahead.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.960]   Go runs a 300 billion market.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:13.080]   Come back on the pod and explain why AI is not going to disrupt
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.880]   SAS. Really? Oh, we see he wants to be back. He wants to come on.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.440]   We'll check in. We'll check in and $100 billion. He had a
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.200]   chance. That chance is closed. He shot a shot and it did not
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   land. That door was closed when he insulted our guests about
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.680]   not being able to afford people wars. Oh, my god. Now you're
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.880]   piling on anybody coming to Dreamforce 2025. Okay, let's
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.080]   move on. Anyways, leave me off alone.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:48.400]   It's like, leave Britney alone. The famous me leave Benny off
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:48.840]   alone.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.200]   So how many new enemies do you want to create?
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.320]   I just every week. Just jokes.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.040]   This one you thought he was running out of feuds. You know?
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.160]   I'm making stupid jokes. The reason people tune in is because
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.400]   you laugh and learn. Did you guys see that? That tweet? That
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.320]   somebody suggested throwing a conference with all of J cal's
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.600]   haters? Jason.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:22.720]   jaders. jaders convention. What is it called? jaders? jaders?
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.600]   Yeah, jaders. Yeah, jaders. jaders. Yeah. I'd like to shout
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.040]   out my jaders. They're just jokes, folks. I love you. Mark.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.800]   I'm penny off. Come on the pod Zack.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.760]   I think somebody could launch a successful summit just doing
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.320]   that. It's like a ready made audience.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:48.440]   All the YC founders will be there. Keynote day one Palmer
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.120]   lucky. Keynote day to David sacks.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.400]   I think it would rival the all in summit in terms of the
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.480]   passion of the fans. All three of us would show up. He's so
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.240]   devastated.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:15.800]   He's just got to have a sense of humor. Oh my god. Megan Kelly.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.600]   Megan Kelly and farmer lucky. Wait, does that keep you too?
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.160]   What is that? Oh my god. Jake out was just so I was brutal to
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.560]   suck in the early brutal. Yeah. Why? Well, he just anyway, we'll
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.800]   get to it. But you're right. Like, you know, throwing a
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.640]   conference for J haters would just be ready made. jaders. That
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.680]   is an underserved and passionate demographic. It would be bigger
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.600]   than demographic. Just just look at sexist replies. Community
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.840]   with shared values. Hey, man, if I can get 25% of those ticket
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.600]   sales, I'm in. Let's go. All right. Let's keep the train
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.560]   moving here. We have an update on the DOJ is antitrust suit
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.720]   with Google looks like they're going for the breakup as
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.280]   Chamath predicted. You remember the Bloomberg report back in
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:08.920]   August, we covered it in Episode 192. Google was found liable for
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.560]   maintaining a monopoly in search and digital ads. Now the DOJ is
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.800]   working on the remedy, right? Okay, they're guilty. So now
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.920]   comes time for the remedy. And the DOJ is quote is from
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.000]   Bloomberg, considering asking a federal judge to force Google to
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.040]   sell off parts of its business. And according to this filing,
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.880]   the DOJ is specifically considering structural remedies
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.800]   that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome,
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.640]   Google Play, that's the App Store on Android, and Android
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.920]   itself to advantage Google search 32 page document released
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.640]   by the DOJ lays out several options. And we'll go through
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.080]   them and talk about them here. The obvious one terminating
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.400]   Google's exclusive agreements with hardware companies like
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.800]   Apple, they're the default search engine there for 30 or 40
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.440]   billion a year, Samsung, that's a lab separating Chrome and
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.400]   Android, my god, that would be drastic ripping that out of the
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.720]   Google ecosystem, prohibiting certain kinds of data tracking.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.120]   That's a layup as well, or other behavioral and structural
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.800]   changes for the company. I'm going to pause their Friedberg
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.440]   and get your thoughts on this as a former Googler. And you
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.800]   interviewed Sergei at the summit, but I don't think we
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.280]   talked to Sergei about this, because obviously, he would not
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   be able to talk about it. So what are your thoughts here on a
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.560]   potential remedy?
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.080]   I think we've talked about this. I mean, look, I've shared in the
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.760]   past, my belief that companies that are big, that have excess
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.160]   capital that then invest that excess capital in R&D can be a
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.760]   net benefit for all of us. Look at Bell Labs, Bell Labs had a
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:50.680]   monopoly on through their association with AT&T, with
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.760]   developing radar, microwave, deep transistor, integrated
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.000]   circuitry, information theory, everything that is the basis of
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.240]   the internet, computing, even nuclear technology, and so on.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   It's because they had this extraordinary capital flow from
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.800]   the scale of the business, and they were able to invest in R&D.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.960]   Similarly, Google acquired and invested for many, many years in
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.120]   DeepMind. And we just talked about how Demis and team won
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.880]   the Nobel Prize for the work that they did. And they, by the
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.280]   way, published the protein structure for 200 million
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.480]   proteins for free out of that service. I just want to zoom out
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.320]   for a minute and talk about the fact that this isn't about you
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.680]   know, whether Google has a monopoly in search that prohibits
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.320]   competition or in ads that prohibits competition, but are
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.880]   do is it really worth penalizing any company that's big,
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.640]   particularly do we lose the benefit of those big companies
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.520]   investing in technology that pushes us forward. Google also
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.480]   invested in Waymo for years and years and years, which arguably
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.040]   spurned and drove investment for many other companies in self
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.640]   driving technology. And if Google hadn't done that, would
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.760]   self driving have taken off the way it did? I don't know. Same
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.880]   with Kitty Hawk and Larry's investment in eVTOLs. And that
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.520]   that spawned a lot of eVTOL investing. And similarly, if you
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.000]   think about Amazon and their investment in AWS, where they
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.680]   were burning cash for many years, that turned out to spawn
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.000]   arguably a lot of interest and investment in cloud. And so I
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.400]   don't think that these big companies are bad just because
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.560]   they're big, I think we should take apart the monopolistic
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.400]   antitrust actions and behaviors that they take and then
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.760]   identify ways to remedy those behaviors versus just saying
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.440]   anyone or anything that's big should be taken apart. Because
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.600]   there is a tremendous benefit to be gained from the R&D dollars
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.640]   that they all put into things that, you know, move the whole
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.280]   industry forward. And I think that leadership is important and
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.760]   needed. Otherwise, if you've got a bunch of startups that are
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.640]   trying to get $10 million checks from VCs, I'm not sure they're
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.720]   going to build a Waymo and I'm not sure they're going to build
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.960]   Amazon Cloud. And I'm not sure they're going to build a deep
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.320]   mind, you know, protein folding company and publish it for free.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.960]   So I don't know, that's just my point of view on what's the
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.920]   likely I should think about this stuff.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.000]   Matthew kind of know this one. Pretty good with these
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.720]   predictions. Tell us we'll be sitting here five years from now
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.520]   what will have occurred.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:17.880]   Unfortunately, not what free bird just said. It'll be the
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.720]   opposite. There'll be some form of forced remedy. I'm
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.880]   sympathetic to free birds argument. I don't think that
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.640]   it's really a good thing in the end, because I do think there
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.720]   are some incredible examples of Google specifically reinvesting
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.160]   in a way that's really added value in the world. I think the
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.320]   problem though, is that the technology innovation cycle has
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:48.280]   gotten too elongated. So you're not seeing creative destruction
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.880]   be the natural force that keeps all of these companies in their
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.440]   own swim lanes. And so they are allowed to become too amorphous
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.480]   and too profitable. And I think it becomes an obvious target for
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.880]   politicians.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:08.000]   I think that's a really good observation there about the
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.880]   timeline of this. Because if you look at this, I have started
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.560]   now. And I know many people are starting their search journey on
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.880]   Claude and chat GPT every day, I'm doing 3040 50 queries and
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.520]   follow ups per day, I forced my entire team to do that as well.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.120]   And so just as there's an actual viable competitor to Google,
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.640]   this action has reached, I don't know the halfway mark, this is
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.720]   going to wind up being completely meaningless sacks. If
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.400]   chat GPT does build a viable competitor coexist or that
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.960]   siphons off search, am I wrong here?
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.360]   Well, it is ironic that frequently, the government takes
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.400]   actions on these monopolies at precisely the moment they're
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.160]   subject to the greatest disruption. Totally the same
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.120]   thing with Microsoft in a way, but it was still a good thing
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.640]   that the government acted when it did, because there was a risk
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.760]   of Microsoft porting over its desktop monopoly into this new
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.280]   era of the internet. I think it's still a good thing to be
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.200]   looking at breaking up Google, I actually think that would be
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.520]   good. At the end of the day, it might be good for shareholders.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.520]   This thing should be probably three separate companies, like
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.240]   we've talked about in our previous show. But it is true
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.720]   that Google is facing the most existential threat to its
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.480]   search monopoly. And it is a monopoly in the form of open AI
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   at this point in time.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.280]   I have one final thought here, a piece of advice for Sergey and
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.640]   the team over there. And I told Sergey directly, they have to
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.200]   get good at making apps to go use chat GPT, you take out the
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.480]   app, and it's a wonderful, beautiful experience. When you
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.120]   go try to figure out how to use Gemini, it's like shoehorned
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.360]   into search results. And then it's like some sub domain,
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.640]   that's why people aren't using it, go buy the domain name,
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.680]   chat.com, and make a dedicated app just for Gemini. Kick ass.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.920]   You're 100% right. We suck at apps.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:07.360]   We said this one, when you asked about the bear case of open AI.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:12.520]   If the DOJ is going to go after Google. And by the way, the
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.280]   interesting thing, Jason, and I mentioned this to you is that in
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.800]   the same article that floated the trial balloon, about this
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.360]   remedy of a Google breakup, the headline in the Wall Street
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.400]   Journal, which I think was very purposeful said Google and meta.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.120]   So I think that they have given their druthers they being the
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.640]   powers that be at Washington will probably want to take a run
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.520]   at both of these companies, they'll start with the one that
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.240]   they think they can disassemble the quickest, and then they'll
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:48.200]   go to meta afterwards. My strong advice to meta and Google is, if
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:54.480]   this is going to happen, you got to go out kicking and punching
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.240]   and fighting and scratching. And I think the most obvious thing
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.880]   is what you just said, Jason, which is, you are the front door
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.960]   through the internet. And there is this completely new emergent
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:12.920]   technology. And where is the same response to chat GPT that
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.440]   you had to x, or that you had to Snapchat, or that you had to
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.120]   tick tock, because if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.920]   And then you might as well just go for it. Yeah, build the apps,
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:29.040]   make them kick ass, make the chat GPT alternative, and get it
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.560]   to billions of people yesterday. That would be the most logical
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:40.200]   game theory thing to do, to build up a pool of users that
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:46.600]   you will rely on. When the DOJ tries to come with some consent
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.160]   decree or whatnot. So this is the time to build up the assets
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.400]   now as aggressively as possible.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.160]   Yeah. And selling YouTube would be the ultimate I know that the
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.320]   ad networks you pointed out for your blog are connected. But if
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.600]   they distributed, they spot give you something about the ad
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.400]   thing. Can you imagine $500 billion going into Google's
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.880]   coffers in YouTube shares, they will have 500 billion in cash,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.440]   Chama.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.200]   I had a I talked to a company, he is the CEO of a public
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.160]   consumer facing company. And this was in the context of some
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:28.840]   8090 stuff. And he said that he and and two other CEOs, the
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.680]   three of them, you guys would all know these are very big
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.320]   companies, the three of them combined are particularly large.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.200]   And they said they've had multi year roadmaps to try to build a
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.640]   reasonable set of tools and advertising and it's been
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:46.840]   impossible. And partly why is that the tools that the big
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.560]   folks offer are so good, that they just cannibalize and run
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.520]   over the entire market. And so what they hear from CMOs, is we
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.280]   would love to advertise on your company, your site, but a your
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.840]   tools are substandard. And B, even though your inventory is
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.400]   cheaper, you just don't give us the same scale and breadth that
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.320]   we get in these other big places. I'm not saying that
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.480]   that's either right or wrong. But through the lens of probably
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.160]   what the DOJ sees is when a lot of these folks write letters to
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.120]   them talking about what they're going through, this is what
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.600]   they're saying. And I suspect that if you could actually have
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:27.520]   a more fragmented market in some of these key markets, it's going
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.440]   to be a little bit easier for these smaller companies to have
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.240]   a business. Yeah, now, you could say, well, tough luck, you tried
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.640]   and you couldn't build it. I get that argument. And I think and I
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.840]   think that that at some point that is legitimate. But the
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.200]   problem is, if you're public, and you're trying to make your
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.240]   company profitable, what do your engineers want to work on, they
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:46.360]   want to work on consumer facing forward features. And so what
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.880]   always falls off the list, it's the stuff at the end, the
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.280]   attack. Yeah. And so anyways, it's this recursive negative
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.360]   loop that a lot of these other companies are in, in the shadow
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.480]   of these big companies that I think is going to cause the DOJ
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.520]   to try to do something,
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.280]   you know, this is a great setup for M&A. It's great setup for
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:08.000]   IPOs starting to look like and this is a multi administration
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.840]   case that's been going right. I think the started under Trump
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.120]   went into Biden and is now going to continue on to Trump or
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.120]   Harris. So what are your thoughts here, Sax?
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.720]   Well, in terms of the political environment for M&A next year?
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.280]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so obviously, it depends which
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:29.360]   administration's in power. A lot of Democrats, prominent
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.880]   Democrats in tech, like Mark Cuban, or Reid Hoffman have been
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.400]   making the case that if Kamala is president, she's gonna be
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   much more hospitable and friendly towards M&A. And
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.800]   they've been saying explicitly that they want Lena Khan fired.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.000]   Well, in response to that, AOC just came out and said, we're
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.160]   gonna have a throw down if you do that. So I don't let go, I
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.960]   would not expect a substantial difference or improvement in the
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.520]   in the regulatory permissiveness towards M&A. If, if we have a
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.320]   democratic administration, if that if you have Trump in
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   office next year, I think that there, there will be an opening
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.080]   up of of M&A. I think the Republicans have their own
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.400]   issues with big tech. But those issues tend to revolve around
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.760]   censorship and bias and search results and LLM, things like
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.320]   that, as opposed to bigness per se. So I think it will be easier
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.040]   to get M&A done next year, if you have a Republican
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.720]   administration.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.080]   Absolutely, I am going to be printing money in a Trump
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.000]   administration, it is going to be obscene how many M&A deals
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.920]   and IPOs are going to occur. There is such a huge backlog.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.680]   But I do think that I do think the Democrats want to get this
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.720]   moving as well. And I was talking to Reid Hoffman, and you
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.800]   and Peter Thiel in the Illuminati meeting, and they
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.200]   voted 190 to two to replace Lena Khan in the Illuminati
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.640]   meeting. Chamath, why didn't you make the Illuminati meeting
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   last week? I'm shocked that you weren't there.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.520]   Not I'm not invited to that. People don't know that you're
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.600]   being facetious, Jason.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.120]   Oh, really? They don't understand that. I'm joking
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:06.600]   about the Illuminati often don't. Well, I'm sorry to the
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.400]   low IQ listeners who don't know that the Illuminati is not real.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.800]   Or now you're insulting the audience. No, I'm insulting the
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.520]   ones who believe there's an Illuminati.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.800]   He's trying to sell tickets to the
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.720]   sell tickets to the Jaders ball. But Buck nasty, Zack nasty.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.640]   Jane Cowne is the biggest hater in the tech industry. You ever
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.280]   see the haters ball, Saks?
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.560]   Chappelle show. No. Chamath, it looks like between the time we
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.400]   mentioned it on the pod, it's actually happening. Here it is.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.240]   The Jaders ball is happening. There it is. Lena Khan, David
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:43.760]   Saks.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.640]   Why am I there?
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.360]   Because you're a headliner. You're you're organizing. I
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.000]   think you're the host.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.840]   I'm gonna be a keynote.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   Yeah, I'm the I'm okay. Wow. I'm the MC there. Look, there's
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.520]   there's Zack nasty. And there's Palmer lucky. You guys don't
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:01.280]   know this bit from Chappelle. The Haters ball from Chanel. Oh
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.840]   my god, it's the funniest bit on Chappelle show. It's literally
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.280]   I mean, I saw a lot of Chappelle shot.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.520]   Just show the real picture, Nick, on the Chappelle show. They
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.600]   have all of these pimps who have a yearly convention, which is
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.240]   their player haters. I've seen it. I've seen it. And all they
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.440]   do is sit there with like a toothpick in and they hate on
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.120]   each other and make fun of each other. I've seen this is the
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.280]   funniest bit in the history of the Chappelle show. All right,
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.800]   let's keep the train moving here. CRB is giving back or
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.000]   maybe not calling down 275 million from their LPS Charles
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.600]   River Ventures. Shout out to my pal George Zachary and Greek
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.200]   brother from CRB. Historically, they invest in early stage
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.440]   startups. They did DoorDash air table Twitter back in the day.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.840]   They had two funds that they raised back in 2022 billion
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.080]   dollar early stage fund in a 500 million growth fund. Sometimes
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.200]   people call that an opportunity fund or a select fund. The New
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.200]   York Times reported CRB is going to give back about half of that
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.640]   275 million to investors or technically probably not call it
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.800]   down. The four partners at CRB gave an exclusive to the New
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.320]   York Times. So either getting ahead of this story or maybe you
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.840]   know, who knows what the motivation here is. But the
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.800]   reason they gave is that the market conditions for late stage
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.160]   have worsened dramatically. And that the valuations are still
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.640]   too high. Yes, the rent is too high. And that there aren't any
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.680]   exit options as we just talked about with the administration.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:32.560]   No IPOs, no M&A. And that VC map doesn't work in the late stage.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.760]   So I'll just stop there. There's a bunch of other notes here.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.640]   Obviously, this isn't the first time this has happened. I think
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.880]   founders fund cut the size of its eighth fund in half from 1.8
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.800]   billion to 900 million. They didn't actually give the capital
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.280]   back to VCs. Like they're saying CRV did here again, I'm not
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.120]   certain if that's what's happened or not. They put the
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.440]   extra 900 million into its ninth fund, if they decide to raise
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.680]   that, which I'm assuming founders fund will. Chamath, you
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:02.840]   have any thoughts on this? I, I guess, we had two stories here.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.880]   So I don't know, Peter Teal did this, and he gave back quite a
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.400]   large piece of his fund a couple of years ago, and then CRV just
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.920]   did it. I want to make sure I get the citation right. I think
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.400]   it was Thomas Lafont at CO2, who said this, it was really
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.920]   powerful. It made a huge impression on me, which is that
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:25.200]   the NASDAQ creates about $800 billion of enterprise value a
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.360]   year. And he brought that up in the context of private markets
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.600]   have to exceed that in order for it to be a real viable
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.720]   alternative to just owning public indices. And so if you
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.360]   factor in illiquidity risk, and the duration, you have to
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.600]   probably generate, I don't know, a trillion $1.2 trillion of
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.600]   enterprise value in private tech every year. That just seems like
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.360]   it's really hard to do. Where is all of that value getting
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   created? So I think that venture needs to go through a phase
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.680]   where it re rationalizes, you know, this is sort of what I
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.360]   said, David's LP day, which is, I think that LPS have made a
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.320]   couple of very big mistakes. And I think the biggest mistake
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.240]   that they've made is by smearing too much money across too many
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:16.680]   general partners. And I think if you had to redo it, a it's
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:21.080]   probably a lot less money in total. But B, and the example I
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.840]   gave, there was instead of giving $50 million to craft and
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.720]   $10 million to somebody else, you're better off giving $60
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.280]   million to craft and not even having that other GP. Because
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.080]   that GP makes everybody's life complicated. They overpay, they
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.840]   miss pay, they're probably not supposed to be a GP in the first
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.480]   place. And so they force returns down. And then when you
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.040]   contrast that, again, to a public market that is
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:47.640]   systematically creating $800 billion of enterprise value a
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.120]   year, this is an incredibly tough game, and it's getting
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.720]   much, much harder. So I think that if you just take a step
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.400]   back, these are the right things to do, because you're much
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.120]   better off having a smaller pool of capital that you can
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.200]   concentrate into the things that matter. You're probably better
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:08.400]   off having smaller teams versus bigger teams. And you're
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.960]   probably better off trying to forge LP relationships where
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.680]   they're not doing 50 fund investments, because it just
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:22.200]   makes the entire industry lag, public liquid alternatives. And
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.600]   I think that that's just not good.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.520]   Peanut butter getting spread a little bit then there. Any
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:31.880]   thoughts, freeberg on this trend, if we can call it that it
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.920]   or is this like maybe they're reacting right as the market is
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.240]   changing, and valuations are getting more reasonable, and the
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.480]   exit opportunities are getting more reasonable. It seems like
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.160]   this was the right reaction two years ago. But maybe it's the
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.000]   wrong reaction. Now, what do you think freeberg
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.880]   for venture firm to return capital, they need to have at
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:54.520]   least one or two big winners. And so if that winner needs to
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:58:00.160]   be a 10 x or 20 x or 30 x of the fund, because most of the
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.480]   investments in the fund are not going to work, you need to be
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.240]   able to enter at a reasonable price. And there needs to be
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.520]   enough opportunity relative to the capital trying to invest in
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.200]   that opportunity out there for to make sense. So in a market
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.800]   where there is excess venture capital, where valuations are at
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.720]   a premium, and where you don't see the exit path, the M&A or
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.400]   the IPO events that makes sense that you can actually realize
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:30.280]   that model, you should take less capital and make fewer, surer
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.120]   investments. And I think that that's what some folks have
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.880]   realized, they don't want to be chasing, you know, highly
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.040]   valued inflated opportunities. And they don't want to be
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:45.000]   putting capital into tier B, or tier C opportunities, just for
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   the sake of deploying capital. This is a really interesting
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.360]   moment where you can kind of see who are the right folks in terms
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.080]   of thinking long term in Silicon Valley long term in terms of
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.760]   building an investment practice and private venture. And maybe
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.480]   who are folks that are trying to build their AUM stack. And folks
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.040]   who have done reasonably well, like founders fund has probably
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.680]   the most exceptional track record in Silicon Valley as a
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:12.600]   venture firm. They are very cognizant of the market
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   conditions. And I think that they're being very smart. By
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.640]   the way, the other thing I've heard from LPS is they're
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.880]   similarly trying to find more concentrated capital themselves.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.400]   So they're trying to put more capital to work in fewer
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.320]   managers. And so there's a real wheat from the chaff moment
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.440]   happening in Silicon Valley venture right now. What I think
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.600]   a couple years ago was, hey, everyone's gonna go do a
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.680]   startup, a few years ago became everyone's gonna go do a venture
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.440]   fund. And now I think the froth that has occurred because of
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.360]   that is being cleared up.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:46.160]   And to just explain this math before I get saxes thoughts on
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.560]   this, if this was a $500 million fund, let's say they were
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.920]   putting $25 million into each, we'll take management fees out
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.040]   of it $25 million into each opportunity at a billion dollar
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.560]   valuation, they would own two and a half percent, obviously of
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:05.920]   those firms, they need to get probably a $30 billion power law
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.480]   exit a 30 xax in order to just return the fund, there'll be
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.440]   some dilution, obviously, along the way. That's why it's not 20
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.400]   x. And the number of companies that go from a billion to 30
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.880]   billion per cycle is incredibly low Uber, Coinbase, Airbnb. It's
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.400]   a really short list, huh? sacks in recent history.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.960]   Right? I mean, look, just just go back to the CRV thing. You
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.000]   said at the outset of the conversation that this was
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.360]   either a growth fund or an opportunities fund. That makes a
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.520]   really big difference. Explain, please. Because, well, an
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.920]   opportunities fund typically exists to back up your winners.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.640]   In other words, if the venture fund is producing some big
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.440]   winners, the opportunities fund exists to deploy more capital
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.600]   into those into those companies, as opposed to a growth fund,
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.840]   which is you'd be underwriting brand new companies from
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.380]   scratch. Typically, an opportunities fund is limited to
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.680]   companies that you're already an investor in through your venture
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.360]   fund. So that makes a big difference. I mean, if CRV has a
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.840]   billion dollar venture fund, and only a $500 million
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.160]   opportunities fund, it may just be the case that they don't need
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.840]   all that capital to back up the winners, they can do their pro
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.760]   ratas out of the main fund. So I suspect that that might be
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.440]   what's going on, I actually think this is a pretty good time
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.720]   to have a growth fund. A lot of the why? Yeah, well, because a
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.960]   lot of the crossover capital has left the ecosystem. Okay, a few
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.240]   years ago,
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.560]   there's in that sort of cohort. Yeah.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.600]   Yeah, well, Tiger and, and SoftBank are still around, but
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.120]   there are other very large investors, hedge funds, and so
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.400]   on, who had come into the ecosystem with billions of
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.120]   dollars a few years ago. And now they've left. And some of those
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.920]   funds that you're talking about, like Tiger used to be $10
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.320]   billion funds. Now they're $2 billion
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.080]   funds. And right size, they're not violently doing I mean, the
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.120]   the Tiger deals, my understanding was they weren't
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.920]   joining the board in a lot of the cases, and they were
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.880]   outsourcing the diligence. And that was a pretty violent pace.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.920]   I don't know. Yeah, this is the best time in probably five years
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.080]   to have a growth fund. Interesting. But to your point
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.400]   about the size of the venture fund, the bigger the venture
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.440]   fund, the bigger the winner that you need to make that pay off,
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.920]   obviously. Yes. And so because of the power law, so to take an
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.640]   example, I don't know, let's say you've got a billion dollar
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.560]   venture fund, let's say that at IPO, you own 10% of whatever
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.600]   that that winner is. And because of the power law, your your fund
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.520]   performance is really determined by your best outcome, right?
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.280]   Yep. So in order to take $1 billion venture fund and say,
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.640]   deliver a three x, you know, so 3 billion of returns, and your
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.480]   best company you own 10% of that implies you have a $30 billion
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.320]   winner in that fund. And there are precious few outcomes where
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:56.080]   you have a $30 billion IPO, right? Yeah, I mean, happened
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.400]   very often on two hands the last cycle, right? Like I just did,
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:04.800]   you got you got Uber, you got Robin Hood, you got coinbase,
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.120]   strike will eventually come out, you got SpaceX. Well, that was
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.360]   two cycles ago. So I mean, yeah, you're going to need to have a
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.960]   meaningful ownership position and a massive company in order
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.600]   to make a fund that big payoff. The data that I think LPS look
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.240]   at shows that smaller venture funds tend to perform better.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.280]   For this reason, 500 million dollars. Yeah, funds. So yeah, I
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.440]   personally wouldn't want the pressure of a billion dollar
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.760]   venture fund, that would be really hard. As a five or 600
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   billion dollar venture fund, you kind of need to have or want to
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:40.160]   have like a decacorn outcome to make that a great fund. But to
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.640]   have to have a $30 billion plus outcome, it's it's even more
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.080]   difficult
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.840]   moving on, Pew just published some really interesting
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.520]   research on Tick Tock. If you don't know the Pew study,
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.440]   they've been doing it for decades. It's very well
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.840]   respected, and bipartisan or nonpartisan. Four in 10 us
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.360]   adults aged 18 to 29 are now regularly getting their news
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.240]   from Tick Tock. Here's some charts for you to take a look
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.520]   at. As you can see, the younger generation is really spending a
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.880]   lot of time on Tick Tock and getting a lot of their news
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.720]   there. I know this because yeah, I've talked to a bunch of kids
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.360]   about this and people that use Tick Tock 52% are regularly
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.840]   getting their news from the platform and that number has
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.400]   skyrocketed compared to other social platforms. Take a look at
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.080]   this chart. Here's x 59% of people say they get their news
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.480]   at x it's really a news platform. So that makes total
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.840]   sense. You look at Facebook, it's you know, 48% right now
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:42.600]   Reddit 33% YouTube 37% in 2024 Instagram 40% but Tick Tock 52
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.520]   up from 22%. So it's no longer just dancing. And this is the
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.480]   reason I think many people in the government were concerned
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.320]   about the attack vector that the CCP would have in the United
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.440]   States since they still control the company for services like
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.600]   Snapchat, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and next door. It's below 20
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.360]   below 30% get their news from their their shirts with social
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.840]   their sacks 57% of people get news there and rumble 48%. So
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.040]   what's your takeaway from from this just sex looking at it in
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.920]   this impact that Tick Tock has is this concerning on a national
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.600]   security level since the algorithms a black box and you
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.120]   could tweak it if you really wanted to to really change
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.680]   sentiment and young people are obviously very impressionable on
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.560]   this platform and their big users.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.760]   Well, I thought there was other data in the study that should
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.880]   calm people's fears that Tick Tock would somehow be used as a
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.000]   political weapon. So in the same survey, you're talking about 95%
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.720]   of adults that use Tick Tock say they use it because it's
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.600]   entertaining. So that's the main reason people use it. And only
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.280]   10% of accounts followed by us adults post content related to
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.560]   political or social issues.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.520]   Okay, that's hosting and the main reason, right? Yeah, but
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.480]   so so basically, you're 90% of the accounts that get followed
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.560]   aren't even posting political or social issues. They're there for
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.400]   entertainment as people watching dance videos as people. Yeah,
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.600]   that's watching. I mean, the main thing I use it for is to
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.920]   watch wrestling highlights. So you're wrestling? Yeah, I'm a
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:24.560]   wrestling fan. What? Yeah. You're into this kabuki theater
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.560]   of wrestling. This is new information. Yeah, I get my WWE
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.120]   on on Tick Tock.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.400]   Yeah. Are you a Hulk Hogan guy? Are you an undertaker guy? Vince
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.400]   McMahon? I mean, Jimmy Superfly snooker. Who are you? Andre?
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.800]   I know all those names. But I like I also love the road
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.800]   warriors. Ultimate Warrior. I loved I was a huge wrestling
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.760]   fan. That was the one thing that my dad and I bonded over we
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.160]   would watch wrestling every Saturday. sacks. Did you ever
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.000]   watch the specials on Saturday night? Like the Oh, yeah. Oh,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.560]   those are so that was the era of Hulk Hogan. For sure. Saturday
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.560]   night's main event. Randy. Savage. Savage. Yeah. Savage is
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.040]   great. Savage. Yeah. I mean, look, my all time favorite was
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.980]   Stone Cold Steve Austin. Stone Cold is great. I marked out the
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:16.080]   hardest for also he was he was anti woke before anti woke
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.560]   became a thing. Totally. This is crazy. You guys are into
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:26.120]   wrestling. I'd say for me, wait, wait, hold on. Have you gone to
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.600]   a wrestling event? Like the WWF at the time? Or did you like the
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.520]   NWA? Is that their moments? When when Hogan turned heel and
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.600]   joined the the was at the NWO? That was like a big moment. I'm
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.680]   a big Andy Kaufman wrestling fan. That was my only interest
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:49.000]   is when when Andy Kaufman came in there. And troll them. But
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.560]   Kaufman Yeah, that was like in the 1970s. Wasn't it? Or was the
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.040]   late 80s. Remember, he was on David Letterman with Jerry
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.360]   Lawler. And he he comes to a wrestling match sacks in the
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.280]   south. And I grew up in my hometown of Memphis. Right. So
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.680]   he goes there. And he gets in the ring. And he says, all of
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.400]   you rednecks, I want to show you some new inventions. This is
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:19.480]   called soap. And this is called the washcloth and you use it to
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.520]   clean yourself. And he's like just mocking the southern accent
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.480]   and Jerry Lawler. I remember Jerry Lawler smacks him. And on
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.040]   Letterman. Oh, it's the greatest. It was a huge deal. I
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.560]   mean, where I grew up because that this was like on the local
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.040]   news. Yes. When I grew up in Memphis, there was no
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.400]   professional sports teams. Okay. All we had was the Memphis
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.040]   State basketball, and, and wrestling every Monday night,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.840]   the Mid-South Coliseum. That was it. That was like professional
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.640]   sports. In Memphis. You also had probably like some state fairs
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.960]   or, you know, like best goats, best sheep or something. Lawler
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.160]   was so popular that he could have been elected mayor. In
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.240]   fact, I think there was talk at one point of him becoming
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.920]   mayor. Wow. I mean, the intergender champion, Andy
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.800]   Kaufman. Did you guys like mouth of the south? Jimmy Hart? Oh,
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.480]   yeah. Yeah, he was amazing. He was like the main heel manager
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.320]   for a while. Yeah. Okay. Before the WWE took over, I guess it's
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.440]   called WWF back then. But there were all these little fiefdoms
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.680]   and kingdoms and Mid-South wrestling was like one of those
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.760]   kingdoms. And Lawler was like the king of it. And yet all
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.280]   these guys come in and out and wrestle.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.560]   Freeburg, you ever watch wrestling? And what do you think
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.640]   of this Tick Tock survey?
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.200]   I don't watch wrestling. Okay, very good. And Tick Tock survey.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.120]   Anything. Where are you? No. Any thoughts? Looks like they
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.240]   gathered some reasonable data. Okay, there you go. There's
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:44.960]   there's your heart.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.080]   My point was that is mostly an entertainment app where people go
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.120]   to watch dance videos, wrestling clips, style influencers, and so
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.680]   on. And I think that this idea that it's somehow a propaganda
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   tool around, you know, programming our youth, I think
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.240]   that's a moral panic that's been exaggerated.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.080]   What do you think the odds are that Tick Tock is hacked to
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.680]   allow you to passively listen even when the app is not being
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.040]   used? Zero? You think it's definitely zero?
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.400]   No, like 5%. I think that's very unlikely. Yeah. Because so
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:23.080]   someone said that that was that was a there was some code that
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.360]   enabled that in the early version of the app. And then
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.920]   some other people audited it. And they said they did not find
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.080]   evidence that there was any technology. And Apple's got a
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.400]   very good audit system for this.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.000]   Did the same people audit WhatsApp? And then it turned out
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.760]   that it was
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.120]   passively listen. Yeah, that's what's that passively listen.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.360]   That's one of the it's one of the most well known breaches.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.480]   Well, maybe they do. Maybe it's
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.200]   100% certain that the CCP is using it because they this
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.000]   people have tracked already journalists using it. So if
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.160]   they've already done it, it's 100% I don't know about the
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.520]   passive listening, but any thoughts on 50% plus of young
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.400]   people getting their news here to my any news on that. I mean,
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.120]   obviously, we don't have evidence that it's being used
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.840]   currently to manipulate people, but it's over 50% of young
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.280]   people are now getting their news there, or say they're
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:06.840]   getting their news.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.840]   I met more than 50% of young people are getting their news
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.440]   from podcasts, and those podcasts get chopped up and
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.960]   clipped. And then people watch them on Tick Tock for sure. That's
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.640]   how it's happening.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.880]   There are a lot of people who think this show is a Tick Tock
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.040]   show. They don't know it's a big show.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.640]   We'll have to prepare for a brave new world in the following
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.200]   way. There was an article, I think it was in the Wall Street
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.360]   Journal that said that Russia and Iran were paying low level
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.400]   street criminals to create chaos. Okay, and I and I read
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.440]   that article. And I thought, Okay, well, what does this mean
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:47.200]   if you actually extrapolate this, which is that the hot wars
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.000]   are very complicated, not worth doing. These disruptive
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.040]   fissures are the better way to sow chaos. And it occurred to me
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.640]   then that tying this back to something that we saw before, it
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.680]   does make sense for a lot of folks to sponsor a lot of
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.480]   longtail content that say a lot of different things. I think
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.200]   that that just is pretty obvious. And so I think that if
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.360]   you put these two ideas together, it stands to reason
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.720]   that a lot of people will be paying influencers a lot of
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.240]   money to create all kinds of content that is specific to a
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.800]   perspective that they have. And then on top of that, if you can
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.440]   algorithmically amplify one over the other, you know, you're
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   you're going to have issues. Is it the biggest issue in the
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.560]   world? Probably not.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.520]   That probably wouldn't swing an election, but it would cause
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.760]   chaos. And we just had the Southern District of New York
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:46.320]   target that Russian, Russia Today was giving $10 million to
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.360]   four podcasters, they didn't even know they were getting paid
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.040]   by the Russians, they just picked them because they like
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.480]   their opinions. And they gave them 100,000 an episode to
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.600]   promote pro Russian positions.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.480]   If the Russians were actually doing it, it's the stupidest use
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.840]   of $10 million ever. Because great news podcasters already
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.760]   had their own channels, they're already putting out lots of
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.880]   content. And this other content is a drop in the bucket, I think
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.520]   your mouth, the issue with what you're saying is just, there is
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.600]   so much content out there already. People create it for
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.960]   free, people create it, you know, because they're they have
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.280]   a career in it. There's a whole long tail of influencers, there
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.360]   is so much content out there already, through podcasts,
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.440]   through websites, it's all being chopped up, that trying to do
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.840]   it as some sort of disinformation strategy, I think
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.640]   is very hard to do, because it's just when there's billions and
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.120]   billions of impressions, any effort that you try to engineer
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.080]   ends up just being a drop in the bucket. I agree. So yeah, it's
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.520]   that's the problem. But yeah, it makes sense in theory, it's very
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.600]   hard to do in practice.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.360]   Yeah, the goal is not to win any specific argument. It's to
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.800]   create mistrust in the entire news ecosystem in the
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.760]   information system so that people give up trying to figure
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.080]   out what the truth is. And that's what the Russians are
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.760]   doing that on their own. Yeah, I mean, you could argue the
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.800]   distrust, as are the Russians paying off podcasters. Okay,
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.560]   let's get $10 million going to accomplish anything if that
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.480]   story is even very simple. Great question. Great question. May
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.640]   answer it. Great question. theory, not a conspiracy there
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.720]   at all. These were very low level mid like, you know, tier
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.360]   B, CD podcasters. If you give them $100,000 per episode, they
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.160]   can spend more money buying cameras, promoting their shows,
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.200]   hiring people. So you're just finding people and dropping
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.920]   money on their head so they can do more of the same. So it's a
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.520]   very smart strategy. In fact, I think,
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.960]   I think it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard that they took
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.600]   podcasters who are already successful and paid them to
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.440]   release content through a less watched channel. That's the
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.200]   yes, it was it was just more about getting the money to
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.160]   produce more content. And then they in these guys are on these
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:00.000]   guys already live streaming like 24 seven. Oh, there's a puppy.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Oh, here he goes. Freeberg trying to win more people over
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.400]   with this puppy love. Unbelievable. This guy is
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.600]   absolutely ridiculous. Unbelievable. All right, listen,
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.680]   let me give Saxon red meat here. He got he got his little steak
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.160]   tartar with my Russia today story that you little amuse
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.880]   bouche. And now I give you your tomahawk. You're ready, Sax. You
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.440]   want your tomahawk? You want it rare? Here it comes. 2024
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.680]   election update the betting markets and polling indicate a
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.080]   really tight race but maybe Trump is surging this week
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.880]   polymarket which is a betting market has Trump 55 to 45
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.680]   versus Kamala Kalshi another betting market 5248. Trump
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.000]   bovada and points bet those are offshore booking and polymarket
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.920]   is also offshore. 5248. Trump, Nate silver friend of the pod.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:58.480]   His algorithm has it 5347 Kamala real clear polling. That's an
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.760]   algorithm has Kamala with a two point lead. New York Times
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.520]   Siena, Kamala with a three point lead Reuters Ipsos pretty well
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.800]   trusted three point lead for Kamala NPR PBS Marist poll has
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.520]   Kamala with a two point lead. So sport books and betting markets
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   are favoring Trump slightly, while the polls are slightly
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:25.080]   favoring Kamala sacks. I sliced it up nice for you. You got nice
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.680]   10 slices of meat here, which slice you going for?
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:32.680]   Well, I think your recitation of the polls, they're kind of mixes
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.360]   up a couple of things. There's popular vote polls. And then
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.040]   there's electoral college, which goes here by state. If you look
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.200]   at pretty much now all the main pollsters, you look at Tony
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.880]   Fabrizio, you look at real clear politics are now showing that
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.520]   Trump is winning the electoral college right now he is up in
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.800]   almost every swing state, including I think, Michigan,
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.320]   which is pretty surprising. Clearly, there's been a huge
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.640]   swing towards Trump over the last week or two. And look,
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.560]   there's still 25 days to go. So anything can happen. I don't
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560]   want to overstate this. But yeah, this is a good example
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.240]   right here.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.960]   Showing that I think colleges is 296 to 242. What is Fabrizio?
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.880]   He's just a Republican pollster. But his accuracy is pretty
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.640]   high. I've never heard of Fabrizio.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.880]   Well, another guy who I think is more neutral is Mark Halperin,
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.640]   who is a pundit who has been very accurate this election
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.760]   cycle. Remember, he's the one who broke the scoop that Biden
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.800]   would be replaced by Harris. And he even said exactly what
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.560]   happened. And he predicted it down to the day. He was exactly
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.800]   right about that. And if you follow his account, he is now
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.480]   saying that both Republican and Democrat insiders that he talks
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.560]   to are both saying the same thing, which is their internals
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.080]   are now showing Trump ahead in every swing state or almost
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.600]   every swing state. And things seem to be breaking Trump's way
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.840]   right now. Again, there's 25 days left. But if you're
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.280]   wondering why is Harris all of a sudden doing interviews is
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.160]   because their internals started showing that she was in trouble.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.040]   So they decided to get her out more.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.560]   And or is it the other way? Is it that the her Howard Stern
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.760]   interviews or whatever are causing her to lose votes?
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.320]   Well, yeah, exactly. Well, so which one is it? Because I
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.040]   don't know when I don't have the dates of all these polls versus
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:18.600]   that. No, I
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.120]   think it's it's what I predicted a couple of months ago. It's the
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.520]   doom loop. So what I said two months ago is that if Harris
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.720]   gets behind, she's gonna have to abandon this sort of basement
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.840]   strategy of not doing interviews. She has to start
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.520]   doing interviews. The problem is she's not good at interviews.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.760]   And if she does more interviews, she's gonna fall further behind
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.280]   the polls. And it could cause a doom loop. So that's where we
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.360]   appear to be right now. I said that on August 30.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.960]   Okay, to Matthew, that's, I think that Donald Trump has
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.720]   basically stuck to his strategy, which is he is a generational
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:57.400]   retail politician. I just heard parts of what he did with Andrew
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:02.800]   Schultz. Another great sort of, you know, podcast. I think
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.440]   David's right, that the editing and the massaging of the Kamala
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.760]   Harris talking points are galvanizing the people that have
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.080]   already decided and turning off the people that have already
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.840]   decided to vote for Trump, and she's losing the folks in the
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.240]   middle. And so this is what's causing her to have to be out
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.680]   there. And, and she's going to have to deliver a very crisp
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.520]   message. And I and I think that right now, it's been a little
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.480]   bit lacking, which is why you're seeing the polls, at least the
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.600]   Electoral College, which is really what matters at this
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:41.480]   point, turn Trump. So she's going to have a bit of an uphill
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.440]   fight between here in November. The other thing I'll say is that
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.960]   if you've seen what's happening in the appellate court, it's not
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.520]   clear whether the Trump case is going to get overturned before
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.600]   the election. But if that does, that could be very meaningful
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.800]   momentum for him. And then I think the third thing is that we
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.320]   should now buckle in because if the last two elections are any
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:10.240]   guide, there are going to be a bunch of spanners in the works
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.000]   between now and November. What do you say spanners? spanners in
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.680]   the works? Yeah. What does it mean? What do you call it wrench
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.280]   in the system?
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.160]   You mean like an October surprise? You mean like some
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.800]   crazy turn of events? Okay. Freeberg, any thoughts here?
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.480]   Would you like to Rorschach test this and see what you want in
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.560]   the numbers? Or do you have some objective thoughts here? What
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.760]   are what's your, what's your take? You know, there's polling
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.480]   data? Or Yeah, where we're at in the election, you're pretty open
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:41.600]   ended here, you can look at the, you can make a note on overall
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.520]   what you see between the betting markets and the polls and that
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.080]   disparity, you could just talk generally about where you think
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.200]   we are, you could talk about Kamala on Howard Stern and doing
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.960]   a bunch of interviews with friendlies. Where are you at
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:58.560]   right now? I didn't see her interviews. Okay. I saw some
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.480]   excerpts on Twitter. Oh, boy. Yeah.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.920]   Let me just follow up on a point Shemoth made. Shemoth said that
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.360]   she had to be crisp. If you look at any of these interviews are
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.160]   the opposite of crisp. She's asked softball questions by by
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.720]   like Stephen Colbert saying, why are you running for president?
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.280]   How are you different than Joe Biden? Yeah. And she doesn't
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.480]   have good answers. She starts free associating. She gives
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:22.440]   these very long winded answers that don't go anywhere. She says
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.520]   she can't think of a single way. She's different than Joe Biden
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:29.280]   when when pushed on that. It's very strange. These are
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.640]   most favorite shows, I wish you would do some challenging shows.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.320]   I think she's got to do Joe Rogan, all in. And what would be
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.960]   another good podcast for her do tomorrow, if she really wanted
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.400]   to, like, do the adversarial thing or something?
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.240]   Never say never cereal, just come to all in. Come and have a
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.400]   conversation. Come and have a normal conversation here. Yeah.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.280]   No, I'm just thinking like, it seems like sex if she comes in
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:57.120]   has a has a conversation. You'll be respectful. Yeah.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.920]   This whole idea that I didn't treat Cuban respectfully is
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.800]   nonsense. Just watch the tape. I don't keep all that.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.880]   Somebody asserted that.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:11.560]   No, I mean, that all if you look back on every single presidential
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.520]   related one we did here, they were all respectful. And they
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.720]   were all conversations. I think the Cuban one dipped because of
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.160]   both of you into a bit more of a debate. And it was a lot more
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:20.960]   crossover than
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.200]   he wanted that. That's what
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.000]   bring back to him. He likes to come out. He likes to do his
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.880]   thing. Yeah, that's exactly what you look at all the other ones.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.840]   I'm trying to think of a moment where it if you look at the
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.880]   other Dean B. Phillips, Chris Christie, the Vivek boring, got
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.840]   to go. Love you guys.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:43.520]   This has been another amazing episode of the all in podcast
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:48.720]   episode 199. Make sure you go to all in.com slash meetups. Make
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.480]   sure if you're starting a company, you go to founder dot
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.360]   university. If you're an engineer, what do you do is go
