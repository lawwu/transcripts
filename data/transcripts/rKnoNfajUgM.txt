[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   You could be the seventh best player in the whole world,
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.920]   like literally seventh best player.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.480]   But if you're playing with the other six,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.960]   you're the sucker.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.840]   You are the worst player in the game, right?
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   So like there's a lot of players,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.440]   for example, like the Dan Blazarian's of the world, right?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   He's not a top level player,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.520]   like these guys you see on TV,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.640]   but he probably makes more money than they do
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.040]   because he plays with people
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.680]   that are far below his skill level.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.240]   So part of the skill of being a poker player
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.600]   is finding situations where you're profitable,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.200]   regardless of your skill level.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.600]   The following is a conversation with Daniel Negrano,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.520]   one of the greatest poker players of all time.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.440]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.320]   To support it,
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.720]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.280]   And now, dear friends, here's Daniel Negrano.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.080]   Everything everyone does at the poker table
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.240]   conveys information.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.440]   So let me ask sort of the big overview question.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.920]   What are the various sources of information
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240]   that you project and others project at the table
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.960]   that convey information?
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.160]   - Well, there's several different things.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.520]   There's the ones that are conscious
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.640]   and then there's the ones that are subconscious, right?
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.840]   Like on the conscious level,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.920]   it might be something someone says, right?
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.720]   You know, you ask them a question and they say,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.920]   oh, you know, you shouldn't call me here, you should.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.400]   So there's the verbal tells.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.120]   There's also the more, you know, subconscious stuff,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.800]   body posture, right?
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760]   The eyes, the throat, the pulse,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.840]   various things that are, you know, less controllable.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   I find I use a combination of both
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.520]   to try to gain information.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.800]   But generally, when I have somebody more comfortable,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320]   they give off more.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.640]   Like everyone has a different approach.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.480]   Phil Ivey likes to intimidate.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.360]   I go the other way.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.640]   I want my opponents to be relaxed
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.520]   so that they'll give me more in that regard.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.200]   - So Phil Ivey likes to perturb the system,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.400]   like mess with it to see what comes out?
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   - I think Phil has an aura about him
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.200]   where he wants you to know
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.800]   that he's watching you.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.000]   Be afraid, be uncomfortable
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.720]   because when you're uncomfortable, I got you, right?
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.080]   And that's sort of his shtick where he, you know,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.920]   and people do.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.400]   Like when you sit at a table with Phil Ivey,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.480]   it's intimidating.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.720]   - He likes to rule by fear
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   and you like to rule by, what is it, love?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.160]   - That's a really good way to put it.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.600]   I never put it like that, but it makes a lot of sense.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.480]   Yeah, you know, fear Phil Ivey.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.200]   And then with me, it's fine, don't worry.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.880]   I'll take your money, but you're gonna enjoy it.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.760]   It's great.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   - So that's what the talking at the table is about
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.560]   is getting to be relaxed
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.760]   and get some of that gray area
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.360]   between the conscious and the subconscious
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.680]   to reveal something.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.520]   - There's that too.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.360]   And also just, you know,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.640]   and this is just part of who I am anyway.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040]   Like I like to talk to people,
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.520]   but one of the byproducts is the more I know about you,
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.240]   the more I likely know about how you think
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.680]   about different situations, right?
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.520]   So what do you do for a living?
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.640]   Oh, I'm a lawyer.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.920]   I defend criminals.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.480]   Okay, so this guy probably spends a lot of his time
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.880]   twisting the truth.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   He's trying to find, you know,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.840]   and then, so then, you know,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.520]   you already have a mindset of like,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040]   this guy might be more likely to bluff
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   or he's probably comfortable doing that.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.280]   Very subtle things like that.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   - And you start to pick up cues
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.320]   on what nervousness looks like for this person,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.800]   what the nervousness communicates,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.640]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.600]   So we're talking about physical tells here.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   - Yeah, physical tells is a secondary thing.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.520]   I was more specific, like player profiling, right?
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.160]   And sort of understanding the type of mind
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.280]   that I'm dealing with, right?
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.920]   So again, somebody who's a lawyer is used to trying,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.440]   is fine with being deceptive as part of a game, right?
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.800]   Whereas maybe somebody is a Sunday school teacher
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   and, you know, they don't feel comfortable.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.560]   Maybe they think bluffing might be dishonest, right?
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   So they're less likely to try some shenanigans against you.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.360]   So, and then the other thing too is
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.600]   what type of person is this in terms of their,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.040]   you know, like view on life, right?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.880]   Are they positive?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.040]   Do they feel like things go their way or they're not, right?
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.200]   There's those people that always,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.400]   well, of course I lost.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.960]   I always lose with this hand.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.200]   And those types of people you can manipulate
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.280]   because when a card comes that you don't have them beat,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.520]   right, but you can pretend 'cause they'll believe it.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.580]   They're like, of course you beat me.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.220]   So you bet all your chips against them,
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.600]   knowing that you can scare them
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.800]   because they already feel like they're gonna lose.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.960]   - The inherent, like the cynicism.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.800]   - Exactly.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.360]   - Cynicism is easier to play against
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.720]   'cause you can convince them that their cards suck.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.660]   - Yeah, when somebody believes that they're a loser
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.240]   or they're unlucky, right?
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.080]   And that bad things happen to them always
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.560]   and they never catch a break.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.580]   Well, you know, you can just help them make it true.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.000]   (laughs)
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.920]   - What do you think about the rounders Teddy KGB
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.000]   when he does the Oreo tell?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.240]   Do players at the high level communicate that kind of stuff?
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.120]   Do you think it's realistic
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.360]   to be able to have a tell like this
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.480]   that's partially subconscious?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.420]   - So first of all, I love Brian Koppelman who made the film.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.380]   And I think what they were going for
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.920]   is something obvious to the general public, right?
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.160]   Like, okay, it's very clear.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.880]   You know, he eats the cookie, he doesn't eat the cookie
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.040]   and it means one or the other.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   At the highest levels, something that, you know, blatant,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.000]   you're not gonna find.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.520]   You're gonna find a lot more subtle things,
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.960]   maybe with posture or timing
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.360]   or, you know, different things like that.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.320]   But at the lower levels, you know, you might see some,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.340]   you might see, you know, with a lot of people
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.920]   when they're in a hand and they've bet
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.120]   whether they drink water in the hand
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.240]   is going to tell you something, generally speaking.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.960]   - It's such an intimate part of the human experience
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.340]   that I feel like if you have food,
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.160]   you're gonna reveal something about yourself
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.320]   through the way you eat.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.640]   I feel like that's a dangerous thing
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   to have at the table.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.280]   - Well, the thing is, generally speaking,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.160]   people don't eat food in the middle of a hand.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.080]   Like, they're not gonna bet
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.120]   and then just like grab a burger, right?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.640]   What they will do though is, you know,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.920]   they bet and it's up to you.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.320]   And then they're, whether they're, you know, uncomfortable
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.280]   or they do it unconsciously,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.000]   they just wanna do something
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.880]   to make themselves look relaxed or whatever.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.440]   And, you know, they grab a water
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.920]   where they don't really need it in that moment,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.220]   but they're trying to take your mind off of the situation.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.760]   - So they, in the movie, wanted to show
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.220]   a simplistic version of something that does happen,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.400]   something that's visually sort of clear.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.480]   - Yeah, 'cause I think one of the things
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.360]   Rounders got right is that it's a poker movie, right?
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.120]   But you don't have to be great at poker
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.160]   or really understand poker to enjoy the movie.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.260]   And that, you know, Oreo cookie tale,
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.880]   like, everyone gets that.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.240]   They're like, okay, that's simple.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.240]   If he would've went with something more subtle,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.640]   you know, like licking your lips or looking to the right,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.080]   and I think it might've been lost on the audience.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.160]   - And they didn't actually explicitly say
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.200]   that that was a tell, I don't think.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.740]   - I thought they did everything to let you know, right?
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.340]   With the music and the slow motion,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.660]   and he's staring at it and he's like, aha.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.420]   - Yeah, but they didn't actually say, you know,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.700]   this is an obvious tell.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.540]   Like Matt Damon's character didn't talk.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.980]   - At the very end of it, you know, after he says,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.540]   how the fuck did you lay that down?
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.660]   - The monster. - The monster, right?
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.940]   And he's like, you're not hungry?
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.780]   Not hungry, KGB?
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.380]   He's like, I keep on, you know?
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.820]   So he sort of references it,
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.300]   and then he takes the cookies, he notices,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.200]   he's like, ah, he got me, and he breaks the rack of cookies.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.440]   - Well, probably if you had that kind of tell on him,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.520]   you wouldn't, and Matt Damon's character would not reveal.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.440]   - Well, he says in the movie, he says,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.840]   normally I wouldn't reveal a tell,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.600]   but I don't have that much time.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.440]   Like I've got to rattle him some way.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.600]   So that was one way to do that.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.000]   - How hard is it to do that to, in the KGB accent,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.320]   to lay down a monster in those situations?
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.820]   In general, how hard is it to lay down
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.280]   a really strong hand, just psychologically?
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.180]   - Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's incredibly difficult
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.720]   for the vast majority of people.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.220]   You know, part of what makes professionals
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.700]   really, really good is recognizing a situation
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.520]   that's very, very dangerous, and they need to jump ship.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.280]   Like what happens to a lot of players
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.580]   is you get married to a hand.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.940]   Let's say you have pocket aces,
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.820]   which is the best possible hand, right?
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.940]   But the board runs out where it's seven, eight, nine,
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.740]   and then there's a jack, and then there's a six.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.000]   It's like, you have a great hand to start,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.880]   but you don't anymore.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.560]   So one of the difficult things for the average player
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.740]   is once they've put money in, cutting their losses
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.720]   and saying, okay, let's move on to the next hand.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.220]   It's a very, very difficult thing for a lot of people.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.820]   - At every stage of like pre-flop,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.020]   all the way through, be able to just make a decision
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.860]   at that moment.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.500]   - So yeah, essentially not being attached.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500]   Okay, I've already put in $40,000 in this pot,
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.300]   and this guy's bet another 20.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.380]   Well, I mean, I gotta get my 40 back, right?
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.540]   Except in some cases, you have to reassess individually
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.980]   this situation and realize, all right,
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.500]   well, this is a bad investment, so I gotta cut my losses.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.700]   - By the way, I should mention that you have
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.060]   an incredible YouTube channel
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.700]   where you explain a lot of stuff.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   You do a podcast.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.300]   You do a lot of really awesome stuff.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.680]   My probably favorite thing that you've done
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.380]   is your MasterClass that people should definitely check out,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.900]   masterclass.com/lux.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.540]   - There you go.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.700]   - No, but it really is one of my favorite
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.260]   MasterClass courses, but also just a great introduction
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.620]   or overview of poker.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.820]   It's great for people like me who are beginners,
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.420]   essentially, but it's probably really good
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.380]   for intermediate people, too.
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.440]   I mean, there's a lot of really good detail there.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.860]   Anyway, what are hand ranges,
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.060]   and how do you begin to estimate the range of hands
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.220]   that your opponents have?
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.140]   - Yeah, so I actually, speaking of YouTube,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.460]   I did a video on specifically this,
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.680]   Getting Familiar With Rangers, and essentially,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.760]   back in my day, the old days,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.340]   we didn't talk about poker that way.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.520]   We're like, ah, I think he's got this,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.940]   or I think he's got that, right?
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.700]   Nobody thought of the range of hands a player can have.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.500]   So I guess the best example is, imagine all the potential
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.780]   hands as being a part of a grid, right?
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.580]   So the first player to act,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.140]   they could have any one of those hands, right?
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.060]   Any one randomly dealt, right?
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.100]   But let's say now that that player raised to $3,000.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.540]   Okay, well, you can eliminate now from this grid
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.160]   a whole bunch of hands that this player can no longer have,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.820]   because if they had a two and a three, they wouldn't do that.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.460]   So you can say, okay, he probably has a big pair.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.620]   He has ace-king.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.700]   You've narrowed the range of hands down, right?
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.600]   Now, through every action, on the flop, on the turn,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.780]   and on the river, based on the decisions they make,
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.820]   you narrow it down even further.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.840]   So the range of hands is the whole,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.740]   the entirety of all the possibilities
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.220]   that this player you believe could have.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.380]   And sometimes they fool you,
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.180]   or they have a hand that you don't expect them
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.260]   to have in their range.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.940]   And maybe a little bit unorthodox,
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.300]   doing some things you don't expect to throw you off.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.920]   But a range is essentially all the possibilities,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.380]   and it narrows.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.140]   Before the flop, it's endless.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.260]   Player raises, okay, it's minimized.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.540]   Now, player bets the flop, okay, it's minimized further.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.420]   And then by the river, you can narrow down the entire range
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.140]   to just maybe even a few hands.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.860]   - Is it always shrinking, or is there sort of,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.420]   as you get surprised, I mean, it's always just an estimate.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.740]   So does it ever expand based on sort of chaotic,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.060]   unpredicted, surprising behavior of the players?
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.700]   - It really should never expand.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.660]   The range of hands should always get smaller, right?
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.140]   Like again, we start with the full scope,
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.980]   and then you should factor in like, okay,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.940]   these are all the possible hands
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.940]   you can have on the flop now, right?
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.940]   We can't have new hands on the turn.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.220]   And if you get to that point where you think,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.900]   oh, well, maybe he has this hand,
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.000]   then you sort of misjudged his range prior.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.420]   So you're not thinking clearly.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.820]   It should always shrink from the full scope
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.620]   to hopefully just a couple.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.620]   - Well, in that video, you also talk about,
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.740]   it used to be that you would play your hand,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.060]   but now you're playing a range
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.580]   that you're representing a range.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.660]   You're not even just playing your hand.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.740]   So what does it mean to represent a certain range?
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.420]   - Yeah, so that's another big thing that's different
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.980]   about poker from my day to today,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.820]   is that back in our day, we would like put people
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.300]   on one hand, like you probably have king nine,
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.220]   or you have jacks or something like that.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.180]   Now, people are cognizant of the idea
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.020]   that you could have an entire range of hands.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.820]   So then you ask yourself in situations,
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.620]   all right, I know what I have,
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.140]   but what I could have in his mind,
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.300]   or my opponent's mind is any one of these hands.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.020]   What would I do with the entirety of these hands?
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.260]   And so a lot of people that are trying to play optimally,
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.700]   you know, game theory optimal,
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.260]   they think in terms of what their range of hands would do
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.780]   rather than their very specific hand.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.060]   - So is bluffing in that context,
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.900]   essentially misrepresenting the range of hands that you have?
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.740]   - No. - Is that how you think
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.860]   about it? - Not exactly.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.620]   'Cause so an optimal range, like if I bet the river,
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.620]   if I'm playing game theory optimal,
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.060]   a portion of my range is going to be, I have it.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.140]   I got the best hand.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.860]   And a portion of my range is going to be bluffs
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.380]   and there'll be balanced.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.780]   So in theory, no matter what you do,
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.140]   no matter what you do, if you call or you fold,
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.620]   in theory, it's just, you're printing a zero, as we say,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.460]   you're not getting, gaining or losing any EV
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.380]   if you were to do it that way.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.300]   - What's EV?
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.860]   - EV is expected value.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.820]   - Right. - So every play
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.900]   that you make, you know, it either is going to,
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.980]   in the long run, you know, make you some money
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.380]   or it's just a losing play.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.260]   And as a professional, you try to make the fewest amount
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.180]   of minus EV plays you can.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.820]   And the only reason you would make these minus EV plays
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.100]   is potentially if you were trying to set up your opponent
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.700]   for something later, right?
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.620]   So I might make some minus EV plays, right?
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.460]   So that I can exploit you later, right?
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.540]   - So you're building up--
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.700]   - Building up an image.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.460]   - A player profile that's false in some way.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.300]   - Something that I'm going to,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.980]   I'm going to plant seeds in your mind
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.540]   so that I can exploit them later.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.940]   So for example, why would players like show a big bluff?
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.700]   Like what would be the reason for that?
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.140]   They show a big bluff so that you know
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.300]   that they're capable of it.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.260]   But maybe in their mind,
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.820]   they're never going to do that again.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.460]   But now they think, you know, he bluffed me last time,
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.580]   maybe he's doing it again.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.740]   But that's what we call like a leveling war.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.340]   Because you know, you can go back and forth
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.580]   with whether or not, okay, this guy might know that.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.460]   Like he showed a bluff
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.340]   because he's never going to bluff me again.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.860]   So that's where it gets a little--
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.940]   - So that's a little bit different,
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.620]   though when we're talking about hand ranges,
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.220]   that's different than building up a mental model
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.620]   of what your opponents,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.860]   what your opponents think of you
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.900]   and what your opponents think that you think of them
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.420]   and so on and so forth.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.820]   Are you trying to construct those kinds of mental models?
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.500]   And is that separate from the hand ranges?
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.140]   - They go hand in hand, right?
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.420]   So if in a given situation, right,
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.180]   my range has this many value hands and this many bluffs,
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.060]   okay, so in theory, if I want to be balanced,
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.940]   you know, this is my range and this is what it looks like.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.700]   I'll bet this 50% of the time, bet this 50% of the time.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.500]   However, if I know that you think that I bluff too much,
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.100]   right, then I'm not going to bluff as much.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.940]   I'm going to start,
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.140]   instead of betting these hands that I would 50/50,
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.660]   now what I'll do is I'll do like 70/30
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.140]   where I'm basically value betting
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.980]   most of the time against you, you know,
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.820]   or vice versa.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.020]   If I know you always fold because you think I have it,
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.380]   I'm going to veer the other way.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.500]   And instead of bluffing 50%, I'll bluff 70, 80% of the time
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.660]   to take advantage of your perception of me.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.060]   - So to be successful,
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   do you have to construct a solid model
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.620]   of all the players in the game or can you ignore them?
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.940]   - I think it's really important.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.900]   Like when I play, I have in my phone,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.220]   I have a player profile of everyone that I play with.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.060]   Whenever I pick up, whether it's physical tells
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.780]   or tendencies they like to, you know, that they have.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.260]   And overall, that's just going to, you know,
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.860]   that's going to allow you to exploit more, right?
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.540]   So like, if I played with somebody I've never played before,
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.660]   I'm probably just going to play optimally
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.580]   or at least as optimal as I know how
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.420]   until I start to gain some information on that player
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.540]   so that I can start to exploit them.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.460]   - So what's the, when you say optimally,
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.540]   what does optimally mean versus,
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.420]   so game theory optimal versus exploitative?
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.680]   - Yeah, so that's like sort of the big debate in poker.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.700]   We call it for short, GTO,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.580]   game theory optimal versus exploitative play.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.180]   So GTO, game theory optimal, is the idea that no,
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.980]   like I'm going to set up my play
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.460]   so that no matter what you do, you cannot exploit me.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.020]   So essentially that's playing rock, paper, scissors, right?
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.700]   And throwing 33% of each every time, right?
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.000]   Nothing you do can beat that, nothing.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.060]   You'll never be able to beat that, right?
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.060]   Exploitative play is starting to notice that,
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.980]   okay, well, you know what?
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.280]   This guy loves rock.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.920]   He loves playing rock.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.540]   So I'm going to go paper a little more.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.660]   So I'm going to take advantage of him.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.280]   So I won't be through, but now all of a sudden,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.500]   when I do that, I'm no longer playing optimal
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.300]   because if you knew that I was making that adjustment,
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.020]   now you can exploit me.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.220]   So that's where the sort of what we call
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.420]   a leveling war happens, where people veer from,
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.420]   you know, the optimal line of, okay, 33% each for each one.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.740]   You can't beat that,
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.860]   but you also can't win with that either.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.260]   - So you're always trying to be at the cutting,
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.940]   at the leading edge of suboptimal play.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.420]   - Yeah, you're going back and forth.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.100]   Listen, at the highest levels, like online,
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.100]   that these guys play, like they're trying to play
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.120]   pretty close to like game theory optimal
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.520]   because it's very difficult to do, first of all.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.040]   No human being will ever be able to compute
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.620]   at the level that computers can.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.420]   It's just never going to happen.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.660]   So that's where like the human mind has to come into play
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.460]   and say, all right, well, you know,
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.920]   if I was playing against a robot, I would do X, but I'm not.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.860]   I'm playing against you, so I have to adjust.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.180]   - So does game theory optimal only look at the betting
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.560]   and the hands in the current hand,
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.260]   or does it look at the history?
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.580]   So if you were to play optimally, optimally,
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.260]   would you need to look at the history
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.220]   of the individual players,
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.380]   or just every hand is taken afresh?
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.980]   - See, that's why I love playing exploitatively
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.780]   for the most part, because with GTO,
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.260]   anything that's happened in the past
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.140]   has no bearing on this situation.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.660]   It's simply based on what is the optimal play
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.300]   in a vacuum in this spot.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.780]   Whereas exploitatively, okay,
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.100]   this guy bluffs way too much in these spots.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.660]   So now I can make an adjustment and call more,
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.960]   you know, based on past information.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.100]   GTO doesn't take into account history at all.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.260]   - So like in a tournament,
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.660]   how quickly can you construct a player profile
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.340]   that you've never played before?
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.340]   - Depends on the level of the buy-in really, right?
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.580]   So the higher the buy-in, generally speaking,
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.420]   you can assume if they're professionals,
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.540]   that they're gonna have pretty similar profiles,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.020]   because, you know, everyone's playing,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.540]   you know, if you're playing this game well,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.620]   it looks similar, right?
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.780]   At the lower levels, you know,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.980]   playing say in a 1000 or $1,500 buy-in or less,
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.740]   you know, within a half an hour or an hour,
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.980]   I have an idea of, all right,
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.380]   just by seeing how some players played a few hands,
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.940]   that, you know, so here's the thing with poker,
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.020]   it's like, I can see one clue of what he did,
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.740]   and it tells me so much about what he'll do
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.900]   in a vast number of scenarios.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.100]   - And you're saying at the high level,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.420]   people don't give too many clues.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.260]   I mean, then--
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.140]   - Well, at the highest level,
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.460]   people are so much more similar
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.140]   in terms of their style of play.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.940]   - They try to find some kind of balance
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.260]   between the GTO and the--
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.180]   - And now with all that we've seen on TV, right?
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.860]   Like people get to watch streams and whatever.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.820]   So you get to watch all the top players play.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.900]   So if you wanna learn how to play better,
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.780]   guess what you do?
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.860]   You copy what they're doing, essentially.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.380]   Like, oh, he's only raising this much.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.540]   I'm gonna do the same.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.380]   They're betting this much.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.340]   I'm gonna do the same.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.900]   So as a result, what you end up having is sort of,
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.580]   you know, everyone deciding,
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.460]   like, I guess it's similar in chess with openings, right?
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.780]   People figure out, okay, this is an opening.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.900]   This is what you do.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.820]   And that's it, you know?
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.340]   And then everyone's similar to that.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.020]   And then you have, of course, the outliers
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.700]   who try to do things a little differently
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.300]   and confuse people.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.460]   - It seems like the outliers,
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.340]   like we talked offline that Magnus,
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.460]   in order to win, Magnus Carlsen
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.940]   has to play suboptimally in the openings
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.300]   to take his opponents out of the comfort zone
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.500]   so he can play what he calls pure chess
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.860]   as quickly as possible,
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.260]   which is just both short and deep calculations,
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.740]   purely what you're looking at the board
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.700]   versus memorized openings and memorized lines.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.380]   Is it the case that the best poker players
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.700]   are the ones that are able to, at the right time,
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.700]   play really suboptimally or really unorthodox?
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.060]   - Yeah, specifically there's one guy
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.540]   who last year sort of took the poker world by storm,
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.100]   and his name is Michael Adamo.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.020]   And he was doing things, like I said,
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.060]   most of the top pros play very similarly
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.260]   with the way that they construct ranges
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.820]   and their bet sizing and all these kind of things.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.700]   He was doing some crazy things that nobody else was doing.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.020]   So he studied sort of a different form of poker,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.060]   and it was unorthodox.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.340]   And it throws people off,
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.660]   'cause he's in his comfort zone
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.300]   with these bet sizes and different things,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.340]   whereas everyone else,
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.580]   they're not well studied in those spots.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.140]   So as a result of him being unorthodox,
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.580]   he became like a monster and very difficult to play against
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.020]   'cause he really knew what he was doing with it.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.740]   - In tournament or cash games?
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.580]   - It was tournaments, yeah.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.900]   He was crushing tournaments.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.780]   He was going against the norm in terms of what is like,
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.660]   this is what you should do as a poker player in this spot.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.100]   He wasn't doing that.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.740]   He was doing what he thought was best,
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.060]   and he was doing things outside the norm
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.900]   that again, in a vacuum, you could look at that
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.900]   and you go, that's incorrect.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.860]   That he should not do.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.660]   That is a clear cut mistake.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   Even the solvers or the computers or game theory
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.460]   would say, this is wrong, what he's doing.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.340]   But it's not wrong if he's doing it in a way
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.180]   that he's exploiting other players' tendencies.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.180]   So for example, with him,
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.620]   say he's playing far too aggressively, okay?
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.780]   That's not good,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.980]   unless your opponents are playing way too passively.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.660]   So if your opponents are playing passively,
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.380]   the answer is to be more aggressive with them.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.140]   And that's, I think, one of the biggest advantages he had
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.820]   was he was willing to do that.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.860]   So bet big, big, big pots, bluffing.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.500]   So in a spot where somebody would make it a thousand,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.460]   he's making it 22,000.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.420]   Like what?
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.260]   What is this?
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.100]   This makes no sense.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.700]   And then people kind of know he has nothing,
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.340]   but they're too afraid to call him on it.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.180]   Well, and then sometimes what happens is,
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.340]   this is where the leveling comes in.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.580]   You're like, oh man, this guy's crazy.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.620]   He's bluffing like nuts.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.980]   Then he bets the 22,000 and you say,
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.580]   ah, I'm taking my stand, I call.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.340]   And then he shows you like four of a kind
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.420]   or something like that.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.140]   So he gets people out of their comfort zone.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.500]   And I really enjoy watching him play.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.740]   He's probably my favorite player to watch today.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.820]   - Watching a guy like that,
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.860]   what aspect of his play have you been able to incorporate
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.780]   into your own?
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.060]   Like, what do you learn from that?
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.940]   'Cause you're constantly learning,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.940]   you're constantly adjusting.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.780]   - Yeah.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.600]   Well, no, and I love it.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.100]   And as I said, so I think a lot of players
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.620]   sort of come to the same conclusions
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.700]   about this is how you play the spot, but he doesn't.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.700]   And I love watching and thinking in terms of like,
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.780]   why he's doing this.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.500]   And one specific thing, for example,
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.300]   is he's willing to really go for it.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.660]   So in a spot where let's say he bets 2,000,
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.780]   he knows he'll get you to call 2,000, right?
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.480]   But he wants it all.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.360]   He wants it all.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.820]   So he says, you know what?
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.300]   I'll give up the 2,000, that's guaranteed.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.780]   And I'll bet 50,000.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.580]   And maybe if you call that now, you know,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.100]   so listen, he lose the 2,000 seven, eight times,
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.700]   but if I get called for the 50 just once,
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.300]   you know, I'm profiting from that.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.140]   And it also sets the, you know, the template for you
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.060]   to really sort of be a player
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.140]   that people are afraid to play against.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.100]   He knocked me out in a tournament very early on
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.220]   in a huge event.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.420]   And he had, he was so far ahead.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.540]   He was one step ahead of my thought process in hand.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.960]   And he did something that makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.560]   I looked it up on the computer, huge mistake, if you will,
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.260]   but not a mistake 'cause he was taking advantage
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.100]   of my tendency.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.920]   - Do you remember the cars?
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.760]   Is there an example?
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.600]   - I remember the whole thing.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.420]   (laughing)
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.100]   I remember it like it was yesterday.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.220]   - Can you take it like through an example hand
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.820]   that really demonstrates it?
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.260]   - So I'll explain the hand here.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.460]   So I'm on the button and I have Ace King,
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.820]   which is a very good hand.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.820]   And I raise and he calls from the big blind.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.480]   The flop is nine, seven, five.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.060]   So I have nothing really here.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.260]   He checks, I check behind.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.340]   The turn card's an Ace.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.580]   He checks, I bet half the pot.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.860]   There were 6,000 in there, I bet 3,000, okay?
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.180]   Now this is not a typical thing you see people do,
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.100]   but he raised me to 36,000, massive raise,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.580]   bigger than the size of the pot.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.740]   - What was the flop again?
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.060]   - Nine, seven, five, turn an Ace.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.060]   - What is he representing exactly?
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.900]   - Well, he could have a straight,
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.660]   he could have three of a kind, he could have Aces up,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.780]   he could have a whole bunch of hands.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.980]   So he check raises me big to 36,000.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.220]   I call the bet.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.100]   So now there's something like 75,000.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   The river is a five, so the board pairs, okay?
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.100]   He thinks for a while and he bets all of it,
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.620]   which is three times the pot.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.340]   He bets 225,000.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.780]   There's only 75,000 out there, right?
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.980]   And in theory, he should never ever have a hand
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.660]   that can do that, right?
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.540]   So it confused me and I was like,
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.860]   okay, well, this guy's aggressive,
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.260]   he likes to bluff and all this kind of stuff.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.300]   So I made the call with the Ace-King
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.260]   and he turned over 6, eight.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.860]   So we had a straight.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.020]   But here's the thing, in theory,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.980]   that river card is bad for him.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.020]   When I call the turn, I have a lot of the time
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.380]   three of a kind, two pair that just made a full house.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.660]   So he was risking that.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.860]   And the reason he did it was 'cause he thought
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.500]   I would perceive him to be bluffing a lot.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.580]   So he just went for it and it worked.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.300]   He was able to double up right away
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.220]   and knock me out of the tournament like an hour in.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.660]   - Do you think he thought you might fold?
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.980]   Like what is the-- - I think specific,
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.140]   I think it was, it came down to this.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.020]   It's as simple as this.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.620]   He was cognizant of his image
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.740]   as being a wild, aggressive bluffer, right?
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.300]   And he was fully taking advantage of me,
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.580]   knowing that my tendency in these spots is to be curious
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.420]   and I wanna call and I wanna see it.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.780]   So he was fully taking advantage of the fact
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.540]   that he thought I would call too often.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.820]   Because otherwise, his play makes no sense.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.020]   A small bet, a medium-sized bet, those make sense.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.820]   But the bet that he made, in theory, is indefensible.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.180]   It's just like clearly a mistake.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.060]   But that's why poker's so fascinating,
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.900]   because he makes this play and it wasn't a mistake.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.900]   It was above the rim, is what it was.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.340]   - Do you think he put you on ace something?
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.820]   - I think exactly what he thought I had.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.500]   Was ace king or something like that.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.900]   (laughing)
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.740]   - That is so fun.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.260]   That is so fun that the two players at such a high level
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.740]   were able to mess with each other's mind.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.580]   How old is he?
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.420]   Is he young?
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.260]   - He's in his 20s, yeah.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.780]   - I feel like that takes a lot of guts
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.100]   to take risks like that.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.340]   - Well, that's what's great about him.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.500]   He's certainly never accused
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.820]   of not having the guts to put it in.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.580]   And that's scary to play against, right?
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.060]   The easiest opponent to play against
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.520]   is one who's just straightforward, passive,
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.700]   not wild and crazy.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.140]   Playing against him,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.020]   he's gonna put you in the blender, as we say.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.900]   (laughing)
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   - How can you control what you're perceived as representing?
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.300]   What hand you're perceived of as representing?
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.340]   So if the game of modern poker is,
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.520]   others are representing certain hands
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.260]   through the information they convey,
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.780]   and you're representing a certain hand range, sorry,
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.500]   through your play, how can you control that?
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.700]   Or is that not, is that the wrong way to think about it?
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.160]   But isn't bluffing and bet sizing
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.500]   and all of that kind of stuff,
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.180]   essentially controlling what others perceive
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.180]   as the hand range you have?
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.420]   - Ultimately, in terms of like,
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.260]   controlling people's perception of you,
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.540]   you can't fully control it,
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.740]   but you can do things to sway it, right?
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.900]   As I said earlier, showing bluffs and things like that,
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.180]   you know, leads your opponent to think
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.260]   maybe you do this more often than you're supposed to,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.100]   or whatever the case may be.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.260]   But in terms of like, controlling, you know,
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.600]   what your opponent can think about your hands
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.400]   in certain spots, I don't really think it equates that way.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.360]   It doesn't really, you know,
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.000]   I think what people do when they're playing a hand
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.160]   is they think in terms of, all right,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.080]   what does my range look like here?
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.440]   Okay, so my range has value.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.640]   So you look at, you know,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.840]   the actual hand you have secondarily.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.280]   So you say, okay, well, I could have this,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.760]   I could have this, I actually have this, right?
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.800]   But I could have all these hands.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.720]   So my opponent, if he's thinking on a high level,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.040]   he knows I could have all these hands, and I have this one.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.680]   So what do I do with this one, right?
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.140]   In the bigger scope of things.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.280]   - I guess I'm trying to understand,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.960]   if your betting isn't a bet, pre-flop, your bet,
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.440]   doesn't that narrow the hand ranges?
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.640]   Doesn't matter what you have, it narrows the--
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.520]   - Absolutely.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   - And if you bet big, combined with the perception
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.680]   of you at the table, doesn't that represent a hand range?
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.000]   - Uh-huh, absolutely.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.200]   - So like you can, with betting, essentially control
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   what people estimate you to have.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.960]   - Sure, so that makes it, so yeah.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.380]   - So that's true.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.440]   So for example, one of the most extreme examples is,
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.660]   we have, there's spots where there's a bet
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.940]   that's considered polarizing, right?
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.540]   So let's say there's a thousand in the pot
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.380]   and you bet 10,000, which is crazy big, right?
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.580]   That's saying one of two things.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.380]   I either have the absolute best possible hand
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.700]   or absolutely nothing.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.140]   Because any of the hands in the middle,
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.560]   I wouldn't do that with.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.960]   So I'm essentially telling you, when I bet that,
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.220]   I'm like, I either got it, or you know, I got,
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.960]   I don't have a mediocre hand, like just a pair of nines
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.800]   or a pair of tens.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.840]   I have a royal flush or have nine high.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.140]   So with my bet sizing, I can control how my opponent's
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.360]   perceiving what my range is gonna be.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.220]   So for example, you know, similarly, if I bet small, right?
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.560]   Well, that could be a lot of hands, right?
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.160]   That could represent a big part of my range.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.740]   - The bigger the bet, the more, the narrower the range.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.220]   - Apparently, the more polarized it is.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.600]   How far could you get without looking at your cards?
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.700]   Do you think, how well could you do?
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.740]   - It depends on who I'm playing with, right?
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.500]   So if I was playing in a tournament with mediocre
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.620]   or weak players, I think I could probably do pretty well.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.420]   - But even like world-class?
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.400]   - World-class, I don't think you'd have much of a chance,
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.240]   really, I mean.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.560]   - The question is trying to get at like,
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.060]   how important is it that the actual hands you have
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.900]   versus the hands you're representing?
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.460]   - Right, so that's the question of essentially,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.100]   if you're not looking at your hand pre-flop,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.260]   you're basically giving up a fundamental advantage, right?
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.680]   Where you're gonna be playing way sub-optimally
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.080]   in terms of your hand selection, right?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.420]   'Cause if you don't look at your hand,
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.880]   you might have a two and a three.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.920]   That's not good, but now you're playing it.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.600]   So you've invested whatever, two, 3,000 bucks
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.000]   with absolute garbage, and it's very difficult
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.680]   to climb that hill, right?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.560]   So it's much better to actually look at your cards
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.320]   and go, okay, I'll throw away the two and three,
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.840]   and I'll play the ace-king.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.120]   - Speaking of garbage, you've said that 10-7
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.560]   is your favorite poker hand to play.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.800]   Is that still the case, and what aspect of it
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.780]   is that you enjoy?
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.540]   - Yeah, so it's one of those viewer discretion is advised.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.300]   Like 10-7, I've just noticed that throughout my life,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.340]   you know, it's a tendency thing,
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.220]   that I've been lucky with it.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.860]   So that's just sort of, but it's not like
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.820]   I'm gonna look at 10-7 and go, oh, wow,
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.220]   you know, I'm gonna call an all-in, or anything like that.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.700]   I'll play it in situations where it makes sense,
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.180]   but, you know, it's rare, 'cause it's not a very good hand.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.940]   - But is there some aspect of belief
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.040]   in the magic of this hand manifests quality of play?
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.720]   Or is that a little, whoa, whoa?
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   - So here's the thing, it's, you know, poker players,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.400]   some have said it's unlucky to be superstitious,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.960]   but we're all a little bit superstitious, a little bit.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.280]   You know, and so, I don't know, maybe it is a case
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.380]   where when I have 10-7, I feel somehow energetically
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.320]   that, you know, I'm more likely to catch something,
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.080]   which may actually make me more apt to be aggressive
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.400]   and confident in the hand,
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.080]   but you really shouldn't let yourself do that.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.200]   Like, you're not supposed to fall in love
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.800]   with any specific hands.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   Yeah, but, you know, uncertainty is ruthless.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:23.220]   It's, you know, the fact that it's a game of statistics,
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.900]   it can be too painful for the human psychology,
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.860]   so maybe you have to hold on to certain superstitions.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.460]   Because, you know, I mean, there's a cold absurdity
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.780]   to the fact that you can play extremely well and still lose.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.780]   I mean, actually, this year, you've played the,
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.740]   what is it, 50 days of World Series of Poker,
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.020]   and it seems like, at least from the perspective
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.060]   of me looking at it through the internet,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.660]   it seems like there's a lot of hands
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.180]   that you were like 70, 30, 80, 20, all-in hands
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.440]   that you just were not going your way.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.260]   That can sort of break you mentally.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.480]   Absolutely.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.500]   Yeah, one of the hardest things, especially about playing,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.620]   'cause cash games and tournaments are different,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.660]   one of the most difficult things
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.380]   about being a tournament player is resilience,
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.860]   because more often than not,
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.420]   so if there's a tournament with 1,000 people,
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.460]   to win the tournament, you have to get all of the chips.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.220]   That means there's one winner and 999 losers.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.500]   So it's very rare that you actually win all the chips.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.220]   So you're essentially, at some point,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.180]   in every tournament you play,
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.320]   gonna deal with really bad luck and disappointment.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.540]   And sometimes those streaks can have you question yourself
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.980]   and be introspective about, okay,
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.980]   so I think I'm 47 now.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.180]   I think I've gotten better as time went on
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.100]   between distinguishing, okay,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.700]   am I losing right now because of bad luck?
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.980]   Or is it fundamentally decisions I'm making
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.780]   are not very good, right?
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.180]   And that's one of the hardest things
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.260]   for anyone who plays poker to get to, right?
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.300]   Why am I losing?
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.260]   Am I losing because of my opponents being better,
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.420]   I'm not playing well, or am I losing just because of luck?
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.560]   And because there's so much variance in poker,
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.740]   a lot of players can be confused
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.020]   on both sides of the coin.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.700]   One guy's winning and he thinks he's great,
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.640]   he's really not.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.020]   Wait till the cards break even, as we say.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.500]   - I think there's a lot of parallels to life as well.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.620]   If you get screwed over and over,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.980]   it's hard to know if you're doing something wrong
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.940]   or if it's just bad luck.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.980]   - I think they did a study.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.060]   I remember there was a study,
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.900]   it was supposed to be related to gambling,
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.980]   but it was mice and they put them in a little maze
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.900]   and they'd go down these three tubes
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.220]   and they'd go down this one tube
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.900]   and there'd be cheese, right?
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.780]   And then they'd go down again, cheese.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.980]   Three times in a row, there was cheese there, right?
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.140]   The next time, there was an electric shock there, not cheese.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:44.060]   The mouse went to get zapped, he got zapped, okay?
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.420]   Came back, he kept going back to get zapped until he died.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.500]   Like he kept going because he found cheese there.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.080]   He has one there.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.740]   So he continued to go chase that win
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.180]   despite it being now all of a sudden not worthwhile
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.300]   till he died.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.260]   And essentially what they said was
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.340]   that is essentially how they compared it
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.020]   to like the gambling brain
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.780]   and how people think about gambling.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.180]   - You're chasing the wins.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.900]   You learn too much.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.420]   You sort of over-generalize the lessons learned
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.460]   from the times you've won.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.620]   - So yeah, like beginner's luck can be detrimental.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.420]   If you have some early luck
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.720]   and you believe that this is just the way
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.300]   it's supposed to be forever,
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.500]   it can put you in a delusional state
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.420]   where you feel like I'm just great, but no, you're not.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.740]   You were just lucky in the beginning.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.500]   - I actually played poker once in Vegas.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.060]   It was a, it wasn't a tournament,
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.900]   but it was a kind of tournament-like style.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.060]   I already forgot what it was,
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.980]   but what I do remember is I had four of a kind.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.500]   So the last hand I've ever played in poker was,
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.820]   I got a four of a kind,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.460]   and there was a couple of others with really strong hands.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.100]   So everybody went all in.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.560]   And I think you get some kind of bonus
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.500]   for getting four of a kind.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.860]   - Bad beat jackpot you were playing.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.460]   - Yeah, so something like this.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.380]   I apologize if I don't know the details,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.300]   but I just remember winning a lot of money
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.060]   and I walked away from the table.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.260]   I said, I'm not playing poker again.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.080]   This is great.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.060]   I'm gonna hit it up top.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.380]   'Cause I started to feel like this is your,
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.180]   I started to think,
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:12.180]   even though I haven't really played poker at all,
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.300]   that I'm good.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.420]   And that was a really dangerous feeling.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.620]   And everybody was really mad
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.140]   for walking away from the table.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:18.980]   - One of the other things
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.000]   that I think is interesting about poker too
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.960]   is good is relative, right?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.180]   So you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.900]   like literally seventh best player.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.460]   But if you're playing with the other six,
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.940]   you're the sucker.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.820]   You are the worst player in the game, right?
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.820]   So there's a lot of players,
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.420]   for example, like the Dan Blazarian's of the world, right?
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.580]   He's not a top level player,
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.500]   like these guys you see on TV,
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.620]   but he probably makes more money than they do
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.040]   because he plays with people
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.660]   that are far below his skill level.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.220]   So part of the skill of being a poker player
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.580]   is finding situations where you're profitable,
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.620]   regardless of your skill level.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.900]   - Another connection to life.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.140]   Do you think Dan Blazarian is telling the truth
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.100]   about having made, what is it?
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.740]   50, a hundred million dollars?
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.860]   Just a huge amount of money playing poker.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.400]   - Considering what I know about the private games
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.420]   and the types of players who play in these private games
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.780]   and the stakes that they play,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.900]   I absolutely believe Dan has made,
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.180]   I don't know how many millions,
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.800]   but whether it's 50, whatever,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.500]   but it wouldn't surprise me
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.680]   that if you play in these games within a year,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.920]   or you find the right businessman
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.200]   who has way too much Bitcoin money,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.340]   and in one night you take him for 20 million,
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.700]   I absolutely could see it.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.000]   I don't see any reason why.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.060]   Listen, where he got his money initially,
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.580]   that's up to interpretation from his father or whatever,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.980]   but has he made a bunch of money playing poker?
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.380]   Absolutely, no question.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.200]   - Do you feel, as somebody who loves the game,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.340]   do you think there's something almost ethically wrong
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.820]   in playing people much worse than you?
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.220]   - So yeah, that's a good question
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.540]   because part of the reason I played poker
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.620]   and wanted to become professional
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.220]   was I wanted to make my mother proud, right?
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.580]   And I don't think she would be proud of me
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.060]   taking Grandma Betty's last $5 and getting down the street,
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.300]   sending her broke and taking her pension check.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.540]   So I play at the highest stakes
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.840]   against people who can afford it.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.700]   They know who I am.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.540]   I'm not a hustler.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.580]   I'm not pretending I'm bad at poker to squeeze in.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:13.960]   I was thinking about this just yesterday
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.060]   'cause I played in a game
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.940]   that if I played that sort of role
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.280]   where a lot of guys do pros
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.660]   that sort of play down their skill level,
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.460]   pretend they're just one of the guys,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.580]   these guys can make 20, $30 million in a year, legitimately.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.540]   Like I believe that if I did that,
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.620]   if I said, you know what, I'm gonna go down that path,
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.140]   get into these games in LA,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.540]   and travel and do all this kind of stuff,
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.700]   I can make 20 million a year.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.120]   But it feels a little greasy, right?
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.640]   I don't like to kiss anyone's ass.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.340]   I don't like to ask anyone for a favor or things like that.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.220]   So, but yeah, I feel,
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.220]   listen, a rich guy who wants to sit down with a million bucks
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.220]   and get drunk and lose it, I have no empathy for that.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.660]   I'm like, I don't have any moral qualms with that.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.020]   - So if Grandma Betty is a billionaire.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.220]   - Okay, give me, send it, send it, right?
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   You know, absolutely, why not?
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.940]   - Well, let me ask you about a tough period
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.060]   of your recent life.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.140]   You had a rough, like we mentioned,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.140]   World Series of Poker, losing $1.1 million over 48 days.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.500]   What were you going through mentally during that?
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.300]   - So here's the thing, you know, I do, like you said,
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.580]   I do a YouTube vlog every day.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.820]   So I kind of share my thoughts and listen,
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.740]   I can edit that thing and keep out the bad stuff,
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.860]   but I think it's more authentic and genuine to show people
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.060]   the actual struggles and the pain that I go through,
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.900]   you know, without it.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.020]   And I'd say the one thing I'm most proud of
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.620]   throughout the entire thing is the resilience,
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.020]   because there are moments you see me where I'm broken.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.980]   I'm just like, I can't take it.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.700]   I broke a selfie stick this year.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.940]   Like I was filming it, 'cause you know, I do for my vlog,
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.260]   I smash the stick, threw it in the corner, right?
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.260]   It's just, that was my like hit rock bottom moment.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.220]   And then I put the camera on me and I was like, all right,
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.340]   I'll let people see it.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.860]   But mentally it was very difficult
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.860]   because there was a feeling of hopelessness
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.980]   where you can, I was making the decisions.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.680]   Like I genuinely felt like I'm playing really, really well,
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.140]   but every time my money went in,
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.140]   my opponent's money went in and say I was 60%, 70%, 80%
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.460]   for about a two week stretch, I lost every one of those.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.460]   And you start to wonder, you're like,
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.900]   I can't win if I never win, you know, in these spots.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.300]   So it was difficult.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.980]   Luckily I have, you know, 20 odd years of experience
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.980]   on how to deal with it.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.980]   And so, as I said, I wake up the next day, ready to go.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.940]   - So as if nothing happened.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.940]   - To a certain degree, obviously, you know,
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.180]   the more it happens in the higher binds,
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.980]   like the one where I broke the selfie stick,
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.060]   I lost 500,000 in that tournament, right?
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.980]   And it was like the last card, it was painful.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.260]   - I think you lost.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.020]   - Yeah, that was great, that video.
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.020]   I think he lost.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.540]   - What led up to the selfie stick gate?
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.940]   Like what, you just lost your shit for a,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.820]   like 100 milliseconds.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.380]   Like it was very brief.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.340]   You're just like, what, the world wasn't making any sense?
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.820]   Like how do I keep losing kind of thing?
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.500]   How did you, why did you lose your shit?
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.740]   - You should never really think like this,
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.940]   but part of me felt like I deserve to win this.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.980]   - Yes. - Right?
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.820]   So part of me was like, listen,
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.140]   I've lost so many in the last two weeks, all right,
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.660]   let, you know, the poker gods be kind to me right now
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.500]   and let me win this.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.420]   And it looked good.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.160]   I was in a great situation on the flop,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.280]   great situation on the turn.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.060]   I'm about to be a competitor.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.940]   I'm gonna be a contender in this tournament
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.660]   to win a big prize pool and turn the whole thing around.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.480]   It's all there for the taking.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.420]   And then boom, the last card, it just, you know,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.540]   it was a couple of weeks of frustration
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.860]   in the moment of filming that I just had, you know,
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.580]   sort of a visceral reaction, you know,
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.820]   and I smacked the selfie stick.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.380]   And then like, I, it was, I see a corner, it's safe.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.940]   I threw the selfie stick on the ground.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.220]   And of course, social media blows up about how, you know,
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.860]   it was a violent act.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.700]   - Yeah. - You know, I mean,
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.420]   it's like, have you never watched sports?
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.380]   Have you never seen a guy on the golf course,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.380]   smack his club or throw their helmet?
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.140]   Like, you know, there was the,
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.060]   there's a guy, Justin Bonomo, who's a poker player.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.740]   - Yeah. - And he's super,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.540]   how to have, for lack of a better word,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.980]   offended by everything.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.700]   And he was equating my throwing a stick on the ground
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.460]   to violence against women, domestic abuse,
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.120]   and the idea that like,
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.980]   this makes women feel unsafe to play poker.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.420]   And so that was kind of a running joke
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.260]   for the last two weeks,
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.780]   where every time I sat at a table,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.500]   the guys would be like, "Oh, I feel unsafe.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.340]   I feel unsafe."
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.180]   - Yeah.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.000]   Can you take me through the hand?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:21.840]   Do you remember what the hand was?
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.680]   Like, what was the?
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.940]   - Yeah, so it was a, you know,
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.700]   the player on the button raised.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.500]   David Peters, very aggressive player.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.060]   He went all in from the blind,
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.060]   and I had a pair of pocket 10s.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.100]   So I went with my 10s, and he had queen 10 of spades.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.380]   So I was good.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.020]   I had way the best hand,
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.080]   and the flop was like king nine three, one spade.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.420]   Turn was like the eight of spades.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.980]   So now he has a flush draw,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.220]   and the river was another spade.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.740]   So he caught spade, spade, and he made a flush.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.660]   - Wow, but statistically, you were winning the whole time.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.300]   - Yeah, I was winning up until the last card.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.860]   - What did he go all in on?
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.900]   Was it a bluff?
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.140]   - He made what's considered like a pretty standard play
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.540]   in modern poker, where, you know, a guy raised,
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.500]   and he was just trying to pick up, you know, what was there.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.140]   And he ran into a hand in the big blind,
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.420]   and, you know, he got lucky.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   - So what was the, throughout the strategy of preparation,
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.820]   the strategy of play?
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.340]   So you're playing so many days.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.380]   Are you trying to ignore the results
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.900]   and stick to a particular strategy?
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.540]   - Yes, for the most part, you know,
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.580]   what I'm trying to do is like,
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.300]   if I formulate a strategy for the whole seven weeks,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.980]   'cause there's a varying degree of buy-ins too.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.340]   Like you have small ones, like 1500,
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.260]   then you've got like $250,000 buy-in.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.060]   So I map out the seven weeks,
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.380]   and I'll give a little bit of mental energy to the 1500,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.620]   which means I'll be on my phone.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.740]   I'm not gonna, I don't care as much about this one.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.860]   But the 250K, fully engaged, fully focused, you know,
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.740]   up against obviously the higher the buy-in,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.260]   you know, super top competition.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.940]   And, you know, as far as strategy goes,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   focusing on each day, playing the best I can,
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.580]   not the result.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.260]   Like, 'cause if you focus on the result,
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.700]   you're focusing in the wrong place.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.020]   Your focus should be on the decisions you actually make.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.620]   Right, and if you're making good decisions consistently,
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.700]   you have to continue to do that.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.980]   The frustrating part is this,
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.060]   with poker, unlike chess or other things,
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.420]   making the best possible decision doesn't mean you win.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.600]   Often you lose, you don't in chess.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.060]   - Well, Magnus Carlsen has also talked about that,
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:25.300]   there's some non-deterministic thing about chess too,
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:30.260]   given the limited cognitive capacity of the human mind.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.480]   So he says that the world championship
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.660]   should have 20, 30, 40, 50 games,
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.660]   not the few that they have.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.300]   It's too low of a sample.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.980]   So in that sense, the high stakes poker tournaments
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.300]   are very, too low sample.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.340]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.220]   But when you think of the World Series of Poker,
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.820]   so as you said, I lost about one million, right?
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.300]   In one tournament, that was 500,000.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.660]   So then, like a few others here, high buy-in tournaments.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.220]   So the sample, or the amount,
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.540]   was 40, 50 total tournaments with high variance,
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.620]   and if you don't run well or do well in the highest buy-ins,
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.060]   you're gonna have a losing summer.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.780]   - So you did a podcast on the mental game a few years ago,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.660]   and that's just something you really care about.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.020]   So what aspects of the mental game in poker
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.320]   is most difficult to master?
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.920]   - I think the most difficult thing for people
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.900]   is self-awareness, right, and resilience.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.820]   Self-awareness to know, okay, so, again,
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.340]   is it, am I not doing as well as I could be because of luck,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.020]   or is there things that I can learn?
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.280]   And I always look to mistakes as opportunities, I really do.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.100]   When I make a mistake in a poker hand, right,
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.340]   call it a breakdown or whatever,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.180]   that's where breakthroughs happen.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.940]   I'm like, oh, you know what I could have done here?
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.580]   I could have done this,
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.620]   and that would have been really good,
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.900]   and I'm gonna do that going forward.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.820]   So I think like with anything,
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.060]   you know, when you start out playing golf,
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.860]   like your goal is to just hit the ball, right?
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.780]   Then you try to hit it near,
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.220]   then you're trying to hit it straight,
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.000]   then you're trying to hit it on the green,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.220]   then you're trying to hit it closer to the green,
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.820]   to the point where the pros get,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.540]   where, you know, they're so finite,
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.180]   they're trying to hit it 63 yards
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.900]   and spin it back three yards.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.500]   They're, it's imperfect.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.340]   Like, they don't hit the perfect shot
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.860]   because the perfect shot for them is it goes in,
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.220]   but they try and make the mistakes
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.580]   smaller and smaller and smaller.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.100]   Poker's the same.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.220]   We all make mistakes consistently.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.980]   The goal is to minimize, especially the big ones.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.460]   - What was the lowest point for you psychologically?
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.940]   In poker in general, actually.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.260]   Maybe it was this year, maybe it was in general.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.420]   Do you remember there was times in your life,
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.900]   speaking of resilience,
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.700]   that were extremely difficult to you mentally?
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.220]   - Yeah, so early on, you know,
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.220]   as basically as a teenager, I was playing Toronto,
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.140]   and then in my early twenties,
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.780]   I'm like, I'm going to Vegas, right?
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.340]   And I thought I was the best.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.620]   I'm like 21 years old, I'm like, check me out, right?
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:54.620]   Show up with $3,000, 24 hours later, you know, money's gone.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:58.420]   And I remember the moment vividly.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.380]   It was at the Binion's Horseshoe,
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.580]   it was about three in the morning.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.740]   I was playing with seven other people.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.580]   You know, I lost my last chips.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.540]   I went to the bathroom, washed up, got out, they all left.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.140]   And it was like a moment where I realized like,
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.940]   okay, in Toronto, I was the big fish,
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.220]   but here they were playing because of me.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.240]   I was the sucker.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.020]   I remembered every one of their faces.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.540]   And then I remember not having enough money
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.140]   to get back to budget suites where I was staying.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.020]   So I walked, you know, I walked.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.540]   And in that moment, I was thinking about like,
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.060]   is this something that I'll be able to do?
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.380]   Am I good enough?
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.740]   You know, what am I going to do now?
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.360]   I'm in Vegas, I don't know anybody,
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.580]   and I have no money, right?
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.740]   So that was certainly like what felt like a low point
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.220]   walking back behind Paradise and Twain,
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.880]   which is not a great part of town.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.340]   - Where did you find the strength to answer yes
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.980]   to that question that you can still do good?
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.140]   - I think this has been sort of a pattern in my life
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.620]   where like in the evening after it happens,
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.820]   like I don't have it.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.900]   You know, I don't have that feeling of hope
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.460]   or, you know, resilience, if you will.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.540]   I'm allowing myself to experience despair,
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.300]   which is exactly where I'm at.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.020]   But then a good night's sleep, wake up the next morning,
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.840]   and just within me, I have that inner confidence
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.900]   to say, you know what, fuck it.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.340]   Get back on the hobby horse, find a way, make it work.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.300]   Right, but I do believe it's really therapeutic
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.780]   and worthwhile to allow yourself to feel and vent.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.540]   So many people today, the Instagram culture world,
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.860]   I call it, it's like, they want to act like they're perfect.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.900]   Nothing bothers them, bullshit, right?
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.540]   You're pissed off, it's okay to show it.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.300]   Emotions, fine, we all have it.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.180]   There's no reason you have to suppress it.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.640]   Obviously, you don't want to have guys
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.960]   throwing selfie sticks around the room
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.100]   every time they lose a pot, right?
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.900]   But, you know, a little bit of--
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.460]   - You're gonna make everybody feel unsafe.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.460]   - If that happens.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.740]   So you're saying, there is a culture of saying,
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.420]   you know, stay positive, all this kind of stuff.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.700]   But, you know, when you feel despair,
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.940]   don't resist it, ride it out.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.880]   - 'Cause it doesn't go away, right?
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.320]   That feeling, you know, you think you put it away
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.740]   in the pit of your stomach and you think, you know,
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.500]   it's gone, it's not, it's still there.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.980]   Let yourself go, fuck!
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.820]   - Yeah.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.780]   - You know, it's all right.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.780]   You know, there's nothing wrong
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.740]   with being a little bit emotional
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   because once you've experienced it, you let it out,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.140]   now you can move past it.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.740]   - Yeah, and I feel like as long as your brain chemistry
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:17.380]   can support it, you can usually learn a good lesson from it.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.620]   Like you become stronger,
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.300]   you become more resilient through it.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.260]   It's really interesting.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.100]   And a good night's sleep can really help.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.680]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.380]   - So through 2022, and in general,
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.100]   what does a perfect day in the life
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.820]   of Daniel Negreanu look like when you're,
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.160]   like on a day when you have to play a big game,
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.620]   big tournament game and so on?
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.820]   So like, what time do you wake up?
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.220]   What do you eat for breakfast?
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.660]   - So my life is twofold.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.940]   Like one, when I'm playing, hardcore,
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.340]   and one when I'm not.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.340]   And they look very different, right?
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.860]   So I'll give you a quick glimpse of like when I'm not,
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.820]   up at 10, you know, breakfast, in the gym at noon,
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:00.820]   you know, post-workout, meal, coffee, walk.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.940]   Like, you know, I try to get, that's what I do for cardio.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.360]   You know, I'm just very like home-bodied.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.300]   I don't leave the house.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.700]   It's very like boring and mundane, right?
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.140]   - Long distance walks, so like,
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.100]   what do you do when you're walking?
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   You're thinking about stuff?
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.780]   - Well, no, honestly, I just walk on the treadmill.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.020]   I try to get 15,000 steps a day,
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.780]   and I just walk for basically like an hour
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.660]   while I watch a show or I'm on the computer
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.460]   or something like that, you know, I'm on the treadmill.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.620]   - Why walking, not running?
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.420]   - Well, I mean, I think walking,
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   I mean, I do a little bit of running, but hardly any.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.700]   I don't enjoy it.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.940]   Like, I just like walking.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.660]   And frankly, for fat loss, when it's usually what I'm doing
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.960]   after big poker tournaments is getting back in shape,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.240]   that walking's ideal for it, right?
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.720]   So essentially, it's like the tale of two,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.640]   during the World Series of poker,
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.800]   all my sort of structured life thrown out the window.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.920]   - There's no walking.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.200]   - There's very little walking.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.400]   There's very little working out.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.240]   There's very little anything.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.200]   I go into the World Series, you know,
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.480]   like this year I went in around 157,
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   and I expected to gain about 10 pounds
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.960]   during the World Series, not good pounds, wasn't muscle,
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.760]   but that's about what I did, 165.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.620]   And then I spend the next month trying to, you know, lose it.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.540]   But during the World Series, when I'm playing,
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.060]   the most important thing,
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.100]   without question that I have to focus on,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.580]   and this is why I stopped focusing on working out
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.500]   and all this stuff, is sleep.
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.420]   If I'm not rested, I'm useless.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.420]   If I only get five, six hours,
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.540]   and I have to go back the next day and play 14 hours,
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.500]   the chances of me being at my best, very, very slim.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.460]   So sleep is a priority.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.100]   - What's the perfect amount of sleep for you on those days?
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:30.940]   Eight, seven?
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   - So eight hours is my go-to every night.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.580]   During the World Series of poker, it's just not possible.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.960]   Because of the way that it's structured,
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.000]   sometimes the tournaments end at 2.15 a.m.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.400]   I get home about three o'clock.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.960]   Takes me 30 minutes, 40 minutes to get to sleep.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.840]   So now let's say I'm in bed by four.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.720]   Well, the tournament's at, you know, two,
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.560]   so I have to get up and whatever.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.120]   So it's very difficult to get exactly eight
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.320]   a lot of the time, you know,
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.680]   and also get back there in time.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:01.400]   - Is there any hacks to quiet the mind?
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.600]   'Cause you're going on a pretty intense roller coaster
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.540]   mentally when you're playing.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.140]   Is there any tricks to getting to sleep,
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.100]   given the role of sleep? - I've been very lucky.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:12.940]   Like, I'm blessed.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.740]   I don't know if it's because of diet or what,
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.700]   but I've always been a very good sleeper.
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.620]   - You just shut off.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.020]   - I get to sleep, and I sleep like a baby, you know?
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.860]   And I also nap really well.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.860]   Like, during the World Series,
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.820]   sometimes what'll happen is,
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.340]   let's say I get knocked out of one event at 4 p.m.,
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.460]   and there's another one that I can jump in.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.100]   Instead of jumping right into it,
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:34.220]   I'll go into like a private room and take 45-minute nap,
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.160]   and you know, and give me enough energy
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.300]   to continue and sort of reset my mind.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.060]   - Yeah, and it solves a lot of problems with the nap, too.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:41.900]   - It does. - Yeah.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:46.180]   I feel like the nap is a magical trick in life.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.620]   What else, diet-wise?
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:51.340]   What do you, your mind is going,
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.980]   you know, pretty intensely all day.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.860]   - Yeah, so during, like I said,
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.740]   when I'm not playing, I'm super regimented.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.300]   You know, I literally measure everything, you know?
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.900]   I count calories, I count macros, I follow it to a T.
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.460]   - Pretty balanced diet, or any--
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.580]   - I'm a vegan. - Vegan, yeah.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.500]   - So it's, you know, a vegan diet, like--
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.100]   - But balanced in terms of carbs and protein--
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.980]   - Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, I eat a healthy amount.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.820]   I'm doing probably 150 grams of protein,
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.140]   like 60 grams of fat, 50, and then about--
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.460]   - And try to measure it all out.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.300]   - I do, yeah.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.460]   Basically, I created a meal plan.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.580]   So what I did for myself,
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.700]   is 'cause I'm really anal and nerdy,
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.020]   I made a spreadsheet with like a day's food,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.700]   and I have six different ones.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.980]   So I just follow it.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.580]   Like, it actually makes my life so much easier
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.420]   when I don't have to think about
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:36.380]   what I'm gonna eat for lunch,
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.220]   or what I'm gonna eat for dinner.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.100]   I already know what I'm gonna eat.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.060]   I already wrote it down.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.300]   And it doesn't get boring,
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.340]   because I'm switching it up every day,
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.180]   you know, every six days,
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.180]   and occasionally I'll, you know,
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.300]   splurge or do something different.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.900]   During the World Series of Poker,
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.620]   I eat whatever the fuck I wanna eat.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.860]   - Like, at 2 a.m., I don't crave
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.940]   like a broccoli carrot salad.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.660]   Like, I want chocolate, candy, and chips.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.500]   So I'll just do it.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.340]   - So you listen to the cravings.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.900]   - Yeah, I realize like--
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.180]   - It's surprising, because like,
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.580]   you're so regimented outside of that.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.740]   - It's really difficult.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:08.860]   Like, I've done it before,
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.380]   where I played the World Series of Poker,
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.140]   and I made it a point to work out every day.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:13.980]   But what that did was,
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.380]   it sacrificed sleep.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.220]   - Yeah.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.300]   - So then I found like, at 1 a.m.,
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.980]   I would be more tired, you know,
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.620]   because I've expended more energy
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.460]   than I would otherwise.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.820]   So I essentially like,
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.740]   look at the World Series,
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.260]   the six, seven weeks where my body's
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.340]   just gonna take a beating,
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.740]   not like UFC fighter,
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.380]   but like a different kind of beating.
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.620]   And that's okay, because I have so much confidence
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.300]   that within six weeks of just like,
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.900]   eating right and working out,
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.740]   I can get back to where I was.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.820]   - But it's just hilarious to me
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.100]   that you'd be eating chocolate,
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.420]   but eating chocolate in bed
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.060]   as you're trying to get to sleep.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:42.900]   Is this--
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.220]   - Like, literally a bag of like,
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.220]   chips or chocolate.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.060]   - Yeah.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.460]   - Like, on my way home,
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.340]   and before bed, you know, just whatever.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.340]   - This is what the professional athlete does
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.060]   at the highest, most difficult event of his career.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.660]   Okay, so what else is there
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.620]   in terms of mental preparation
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.460]   and focus and meditation,
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.100]   those kinds of things leading up to the games?
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.260]   Is there anything you like to,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.860]   like, any rituals you like to follow?
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.100]   - So yeah, I have dabbled in the past
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.740]   with like, meditation and different things like that.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.540]   And I know that there's health benefits to it.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.220]   And I understand that a lot of people
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.340]   get a lot from it.
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.540]   And I've done it for good amount of time,
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.340]   like, long periods of time.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.500]   I found that for me,
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.740]   I think it was predominantly placebo.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.420]   Like, it really wasn't doing anything for me
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.380]   that I felt like it was,
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.540]   it felt like I was doing something,
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.860]   but I really, I didn't see any specific results from it.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.980]   So, I don't really do that too much.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:37.340]   One thing that I will do for me is leading up,
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.260]   is there's so much footage now
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.260]   that I'll make it a point to like, watch my opponents.
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:45.620]   And then with like, my phone, I'll take notes
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.980]   and I'll keep track of different things that I'm seeing.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.820]   And that sort of,
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.980]   and then what I'll do is I'll formulate a game plan.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.980]   Like, I'm playing the Poker Masters coming up
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.140]   in about a week.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.940]   And I'll look to see the tendencies
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.820]   of what my opponents are doing.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.700]   And then I'll come up with like,
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.060]   some things that I'm gonna do,
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.580]   some tricks of the trade, if you will.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.460]   Not game theory optimal stuff,
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.300]   stuff that I think,
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.980]   "Oh, they're making a mistake here that I can exploit."
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.980]   And then I look to do that in different ways
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.740]   and always look to, you know, throw curve balls.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.300]   - How hard is that process?
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.140]   Do you enjoy it?
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.340]   Or is it like, really hard work to analyze the players
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.140]   to try to understand what are the different holes,
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.140]   what are the different mistakes,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.740]   what are the strengths to avoid and that kind of stuff?
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.620]   - I think the only thing that makes it harder
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.420]   is when you're young, right?
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.260]   And you're in your twenties
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.900]   and you're trying to make your nest egg.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.780]   You're like, you're trying to make your retirement money.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.900]   You're hungry, right?
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.580]   You're like Clubber Lang and you know, the gym,
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.420]   you're hungry.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.420]   Whereas, you know, Rocky's in there taking pictures
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.900]   and smiling and doing commercials and stuff like that.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.460]   So I am 47, I'm financially okay.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.060]   I don't need to win.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.220]   I don't need to compete at the highest levels.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.620]   So I think it was a boxer.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.980]   I don't remember which one.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.580]   When asked this, he was asked the question, you know,
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.740]   how do you get up in the morning, you know,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   still and do those morning runs?
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.580]   And he says, you know what?
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:56.540]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.860]   It's a lot more difficult doing the 4 a.m. run
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.820]   in silk pajamas, right?
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.120]   It just is, right?
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.780]   But I've always been self-motivated
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.120]   and I've always found a way.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.980]   So it's harder in the sense of like, it's not a need.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.020]   I can still get by without it.
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.620]   But so in that regard,
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.140]   it does feel like a little bit of work
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.980]   where like, oh my God,
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   that's a lot of footage I gotta get through.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:19.980]   And I don't know that I have the time
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.300]   or I don't know that I wanna spend 10 hours of my day
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.700]   doing that when I could be doing other things.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.060]   - I mean, what do you still love about poker?
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.580]   When you said, when you enter,
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:34.460]   like the times you catch yourself just being able
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.900]   to sort of take in the awe of it.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.340]   What aspects do you love?
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.440]   - I think that like for me,
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.180]   I've always been really competitive,
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.060]   but I was never gonna be a professional athlete
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.220]   or a professional snooker player.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.820]   I wasn't good enough at any of that stuff.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.180]   I didn't have the body type, whatever.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.620]   But poker, it sort of levels the playing field, right?
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.020]   You're six, five, 240, big deal.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.940]   You know, we're not fighting here.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.600]   We're fighting a different type of war.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.020]   So the competitive aspect,
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.740]   I also have always been fueled throughout my career
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.260]   by doubters.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.740]   So this is probably unhealthy,
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.100]   but every time people say like, you're done,
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.540]   you're washed up, you can't win anymore.
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.660]   It just makes me wanna prove them wrong, right?
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.340]   So I have a little bit of that in me,
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.800]   which again, you reading the comments and all these kinds,
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.740]   like I've been told many times throughout my career
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.620]   for the last 15 that I'm done, I can't compete anymore.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:27.300]   And I enjoy, you know, proving them wrong.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.960]   - Yeah, the game has changed so much.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.400]   The greats of the past surely cannot be the greats
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.300]   of the present.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.900]   Those that kind of commentary will continue for every sport.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.100]   And certainly for poker,
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.120]   'cause poker really changed a lot
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.460]   over the past couple of decades.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.660]   Can you speak to how much has changed?
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.500]   - Yeah, I see. - Because it's been
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.420]   at the top for so long.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.380]   - Yeah, so complacency is a big issue
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   for people who make it, if you will, right?
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.300]   So in my era of the poker boom, around the early 2000s,
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.500]   there was a group of players who were the big names,
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.700]   the stars of the game.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:01.420]   Well, a lot of them had their egos out of whack,
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.920]   where they just felt like, okay, I'm the best, that's it.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.620]   Like, no, there's young guys learning,
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.900]   there's new software, there's solvers,
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:08.740]   there's all these kinds of things.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.100]   And if you're not keeping up, then you'll get surpassed.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.140]   And I remember myself at a very early age saying,
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.300]   I never wanna be that guy.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.820]   And it was one of my first events in the late '90s.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.020]   I was the young buck, playing with the Tom McAvoys
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.500]   and Brad Doughty, the guys of the era, right?
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.420]   And I was doing things more aggressively,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.920]   and they were scoffing at, oh, these young kids
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.900]   with their aggressive three and all this stuff.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.120]   And they were sort of mocking it, you know?
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.180]   And I thought, never be that guy.
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.900]   Always have the humility to be introspective,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.140]   and always have the respect for your opponents
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.180]   that while you think you've got it all figured out,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.340]   they're learning new things and you can learn from them.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:46.540]   So I've always been willing to sort of swallow my pride
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.780]   and get coached by younger players,
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.260]   who I might even be better than,
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:53.260]   but they see blind spots that I have that I might not.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.220]   And they help me improve my game.
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.180]   I've always been willing to sort of look
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.380]   every six months or year and say,
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.300]   is what I'm doing working?
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.620]   And if not, how do I get better?
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.320]   But most people from my generation, they go the other way.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.420]   I don't know, they just have this idea
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.260]   that they figured it all out.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.020]   Once you feel like you've mastered it,
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:10.860]   there's nothing left to learn.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.820]   That's the moment where everyone else starts to surpass you.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:17.780]   - That's the moment where you lose the mastery
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:18.860]   'cause it's always evolving.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.660]   How has the game changed?
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:21.980]   - So the game has changed in terms
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.780]   of the way people learn it, right?
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.660]   When I started out, the only way to learn how to play poker
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.380]   was to sit your ass on the chair and play.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.460]   - In person? - Yes, in person.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.820]   Play, maybe you jot down hands on a notepad.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.740]   We didn't even have cell phones back then, right?
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.380]   So I would write notes.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:39.140]   I actually brought a notepad and then analyze it
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.340]   and sort of try to figure it out that way
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.620]   and think about maybe talking to friends
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.540]   and different players.
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.260]   Like when I grew up, there was John Juanda,
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.740]   Alan Cunningham, and Phil Ivey.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:52.260]   And we would sort of create a little bit of a mastermind.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.260]   Well, how would you play this hand?
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:54.100]   What would you do here?
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   That was the extent of it, right?
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.940]   We never had the correct answers.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.520]   We always had theories about what might be right.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.220]   Not until about five, six years ago
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.620]   where everything changed,
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:07.520]   where artificial intelligence created solvers
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:11.060]   that will specifically say, okay, this is the optimal play.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.820]   This is the game through optimal play.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.220]   So now it introduced poker to a whole new group
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.540]   of personality types.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.460]   In my day, it was people that were dregs of society
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.260]   that didn't fit in, not college goers with a degree.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.580]   These are people who were street hustlers, playing pool.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.660]   They found poker and they had these unique lives, right?
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.740]   But now, because poker can be studied,
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.300]   much like you study university or college,
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.420]   you had, for example, the German contingent
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.300]   who was literally analyzing data
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.300]   and coming up with strategies based on this.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.380]   And it's like, what?
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.900]   You know, and the old guy, like,
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.780]   you know, gotta play by feel or whatever.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.340]   And they're like, they're learning.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.460]   So I guess the way that you describe it is like,
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:52.160]   in the old days, it required skill and talent,
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.860]   a card sense, right?
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.100]   That was the only way to become good.
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.980]   And today that's not the case.
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:59.540]   Good study habits, a good work ethic in that regard
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.220]   can make you like a really good player,
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.020]   even if you aren't all that talented or gifted.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.460]   Having a good work ethic is a talent, right?
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.860]   Not necessarily card sense, but if you're able to put
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.200]   in the work and study from these solvers,
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.540]   you essentially have the perfect study tool now
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.140]   that we didn't have in my day.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.900]   - So what do the solvers give you?
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.120]   Do you start to memorize the optimal play
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.100]   for every single hand?
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.300]   - You try your best.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.740]   So again, solvers are imperfect as well,
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   in terms of the way the humans utilize them, right?
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:36.900]   Because you can give solvers a certain number of inputs
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.540]   in terms of what you want it to solve,
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.920]   but a solver can think on many, many levels.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.280]   So for example, the way that a typical player
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.620]   would do a solve is to say, okay,
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.900]   what does the solver think is the best play here?
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.740]   Bet one third pot, bet two thirds pot,
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.620]   or bet one and a half times pot, okay?
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.420]   You give it three parameters.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.460]   It comes out with an output and it tells you
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.420]   what you should do with all the different hands,
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.340]   you know, you have.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.820]   However, that's a simplified version
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.940]   of what a solver would really do,
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.780]   because a solver might decide that seven times the pot
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.660]   is best, 10% of the pot.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.860]   But when you're putting in a solve,
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.540]   you can only put in, you know, specific parameters.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.920]   So that's why, frankly, that's typically the number,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.140]   one third, two third, and one and a half times pot
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.500]   is what people often do.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.860]   So they sort of have a vague idea of what a solver wants.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.100]   But again, imperfect in terms of the implementation of it,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.100]   right, and memorizing all the variables,
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.820]   like that King Jack offsuit with the King of Diamonds
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.840]   is 13%, no human brain can do that.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.540]   So what you do is you bucket it.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:41.040]   Like you bucket it into, say, instead of 10,000 variables,
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.620]   you have 10 buckets and you say, okay,
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.180]   with these hands, we do roughly this,
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.180]   and we do roughly this.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.220]   And you try your best to, you know,
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.300]   stay within those lines.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.500]   But again, what I love about live poker partly
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:54.780]   is that nobody will ever be able to master game theory,
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.780]   you know, and mimic a solver.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:02.780]   - But you also have to incorporate your position,
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:06.420]   where you are, and obviously what cards you have,
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.860]   but also the size of your stack, how much money you have,
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.560]   and also whether you have the ability or desire to buy in,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.400]   all those kinds of things.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.580]   So you have to calculate all of that, right?
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.380]   - So the, you know, so the solver will do that, right?
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.100]   And essentially, you don't input your hand.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.980]   It tells you, you'll look at the grade and be like,
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.980]   all right, this is my hand, and it tells you what it is,
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.940]   but it tells you what you would do with any hand, right?
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.220]   It gives you the full output.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.980]   - And that actually gives you a better idea
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.760]   'cause you're ultimately, like you said,
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.380]   playing a range of hands, not a hand.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.180]   - And the solvers do things that are really interesting.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.000]   You've seen AlphaGo, I would imagine.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.660]   Brilliant film, right, I thought.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.860]   And I thought what was interesting is there was,
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.100]   you know, accepted theory from all the top Go players
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.100]   that this is what you do.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.340]   But the AI was doing things way different,
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.680]   and they're like, this has to be wrong,
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.840]   but really it wasn't.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.740]   So for example, a solver may say this, right?
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.300]   Let's say you bet on the end, and you bet a lot,
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.420]   and a solver may say, you should fold here
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:10.020]   with a pair of kings and a queen kicker,
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.960]   which is, you know, a pair of kings,
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.020]   but call with a pair of fours and an ace kicker.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.860]   So it's essentially telling you
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.780]   that you should fold this hand
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.020]   that is much better than this.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:23.140]   So it begs the question, why?
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.940]   Because what the solvers do is they use the information
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:30.380]   of your own cards to formulate all the possible hands
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.060]   your opponent can have.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.140]   So if your opponent is,
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.620]   so basically if you had the king queen,
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.900]   you know, it may say,
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.720]   for lack of a better nerdy term,
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.460]   it blocks potential bluffing hands
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.620]   that your opponent can have.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.740]   So let's say if your opponent would bluff with queen jack,
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.120]   but you have a queen.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.280]   So there are less combinations of queen jack.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.180]   So it will find a better bluff catcher, if you will.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.520]   So that's what's really not intuitive to poker players.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.020]   Poker players usually think like,
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.780]   well, this, my hand is pretty good, so I got a call.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.540]   But that's not how a solver would think.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:06.980]   Solver uses, you know, common atrix and, you know.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.580]   - And sometimes it's tough to get the good why answers
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.300]   you just did for why a solver thinks something is better.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.860]   Or maybe in poker, it's a little bit easier,
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:18.820]   but in the case of go and chess, it's not always obvious why
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.420]   because it's not gonna explain stuff to you.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.460]   - But I think one of the best ways to learn poker
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.100]   is when you see a solver output
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.220]   and it tells you one of these things, try to figure out why.
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.000]   Why does this solver do this?
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.380]   Why does it want you to call with this and fold this?
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.180]   And try to think about it on a deeper level.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.820]   And you go, aha, probably because this card
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.780]   that I have here, you know,
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.580]   changes the range of my opponent's, you know, potential.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.940]   - I'd love to get your opinion
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.540]   on your relationship with solvers.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.940]   'Cause for example, Magnus doesn't use them.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.380]   His team uses them.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:54.180]   'Cause he feels like he's going to rely on it too much
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.100]   and you can't use it when you're playing.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.820]   What you really want is to build up
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.740]   extremely strong intuition without the help of a solver.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.900]   Is there some aspect of that that rings true to you?
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.020]   - Absolutely, I totally can relate to what Magnus is saying.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.860]   First and foremost,
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.900]   because when solvers were first introduced,
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.100]   I didn't come from that world.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.580]   I was so intimidated 'cause I didn't know how to use it.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.380]   I don't know how to do an input.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.540]   So I had two guys, one guy's a data scientist
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.580]   and you know, another guy's like a poker savant, if you will.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.500]   And they coached me and they did it.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.740]   So today, if I was in a tough spot, you know,
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.100]   and I'm like, I don't know, what would a solver do?
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.980]   I will send them the hand and they'll run the solve for me.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.380]   And then sort of give me the parameters of what to do.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.900]   When I was playing, you know,
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.700]   regularly using solvers with them,
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.220]   we were spending six to eight hours a day
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.300]   going over all these solves.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.740]   So intuitively, I started to think and learn
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.100]   about what the solver would want.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.100]   But I sort of understand where Magnus is coming from
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.300]   in that you don't wanna become a slave to the sim,
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.740]   as I say, right?
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.700]   There's one kid I know, I joked with him,
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.140]   his name is Landon Tice.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.220]   And you know, he made a play that the sim, you know,
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.860]   would say, this is a good play.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.780]   But I'm like, it's a good play, you know,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.820]   in a simulated world against the robot.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.100]   It's not in practice against the human, right?
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.660]   You don't need to be doing that.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.780]   So if you become a slave to the sim
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.620]   and always do what the sim says,
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:13.100]   you're handcuffed to a certain degree.
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.020]   - Is there some, at the highest level plays,
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.460]   there's still a role for feel intuition.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.180]   - Absolutely, if you're not doing that,
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.700]   'cause here's the thing, right?
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.580]   No human being plays perfectly balanced
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.620]   in game three optimal like a robot would.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.180]   They're not, right?
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.980]   So there are opportunities there to take advantage
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.340]   of the things that they do that are slightly too aggressive
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.780]   or less aggressive.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.740]   You know, for example, say most human beings
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.060]   don't bluff enough in a certain spot.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:44.660]   So you don't have to call with the correct range of hands.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.740]   You don't have to because they're not bluffing
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.020]   at the optimal frequency.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.500]   So you don't have to call at the optimal frequency.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.900]   You'd be making a mistake, frankly, if you did.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:56.860]   - What's the difference between in-person
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.500]   and online play, given that context?
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.980]   - Yeah, well, online poker and live poker,
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.340]   it's the same game, right?
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.140]   Same, it's poker, but it's different in so many levels.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.820]   I think playing online,
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.020]   you have to focus far more on fundamentals,
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.180]   you know, on game theory.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.940]   You don't have the added bonus of looking across the table
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.060]   and getting any sense of whether your opponent
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.300]   is strong or weak, they're bluffing, whatever, you know.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:24.700]   And also because online poker, those that play it,
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.740]   you play far more hands.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.900]   Like some of these guys are playing 10, 20 tables
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.460]   at the same time, right?
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.420]   So you're just, you're hitting the long run really quickly
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.100]   and you're creating a database on your opponents, right?
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.540]   So let's have, you know, online, I can see your data.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.460]   I'm like, well, this guy, he's playing 40% of hands.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.220]   He's betting the river 80% of the time.
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.580]   So now I can use that data and, you know,
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.420]   exploit you that way.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.980]   When you play live, you don't have that.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.140]   - Do you enjoy playing online?
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.900]   - I enjoy, so with online poker,
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.380]   I enjoy the convenience of it.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.700]   'Cause you know, you can be on your couch,
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.380]   in your underwear, not leave your house.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.060]   - Do you also play multiple games at the same time
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.500]   or do you try to play one game?
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.620]   - I typically like to play one or two,
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.100]   but I can play up to four.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:09.340]   I find that past four, it's hard for me to keep up
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.340]   and keep track of what's actually happening.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.220]   You know, it's a different mindset required.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.180]   Like a lot of these young guys,
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.680]   they're accustomed to 20 tables at a time.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.620]   - It feels like the purity of the game is gone.
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.980]   - Well, it's much more robotic, right?
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.740]   So if you're playing 20 tables,
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.980]   you're just making decisions based on like what you,
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:29.260]   you know, you're not thinking about the depth
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.620]   of the situation and what just happened 15 minutes ago.
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.580]   You don't even know what happened
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:35.340]   because you can't pay attention to all that at once.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.500]   - And some of the magic of poker is the low sample.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.340]   - I agree.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:41.220]   - So for example, and sorry to be bringing up Magnus so much
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.940]   but there's so much parallel between the two of you
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.620]   and the poker and the chess world.
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:49.180]   He hates Olympics and world championships
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.740]   and all that kind of stuff because it's so low sample.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.420]   But to me, that's part of the magic of it.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.880]   There's the World Series of Poker, the main event.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.460]   There's a magic to it.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.300]   - I agree, yeah.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.940]   - And I don't know what that is exactly
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.740]   because so much is at stake, it's so rare.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.860]   So much drama and heartbreak leading up to it
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:12.220]   that all somehow, yeah, it accumulates
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.380]   to that magical moment when somebody wins.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.460]   - It's especially that event.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.300]   The World Series of Poker main event historically,
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.060]   like that's it, you know, that's the pinnacle.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.580]   That's where like mainstream watches.
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.280]   That's where people are tuning in
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.460]   and the gravity of the moment, you know,
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.660]   it's so much bigger than people.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.340]   Like everyone gets the opportunity
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.420]   to play armchair quarterback too, right?
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.500]   Oh, he should do this.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.540]   You're not there.
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.620]   You're not under the lights.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.940]   You're not under the pressure.
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.420]   You know, it might seem easy for you at home to be like,
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.380]   well, yeah, but you can see the whole cards.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.500]   You know, they can't.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.220]   Certainly the idea of the small sample with tournaments,
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:49.220]   I like the idea that you don't have to worry about,
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.980]   oh, well, if I do this now, then in the future,
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.020]   you know, I won't be balanced.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.700]   I have to be balanced here or anything like that.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.020]   That's like really boring and lame, right?
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.780]   Again, that is kind of the way the younger generation
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.700]   learns how to play the game, being balanced in every spot
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.820]   and then randomizing, you know, like,
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.220]   oh, I'm supposed to do this 50% of the time.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.340]   Okay, so if my left card is red, I'll do it.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.260]   And if it's black, I don't.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.380]   So you're not even making,
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.980]   you're no longer making actual decisions for yourself.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.420]   You're just randomizing.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.740]   And that's way less fun for me
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.180]   than tailoring it to the situation.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.700]   - And the final table at the main event,
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.540]   there's none of that.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.260]   You have to, I mean, it's all or nothing.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.820]   - Well, you shouldn't be, but there are.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.580]   Like again, I think a lot of the young guys,
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.820]   they are thinking in that regard, like, oh, randomization.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:38.060]   - Maybe at that table, the final table at the main event.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.780]   What's a hand that stands out to you
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.140]   that was especially gutsy and powerful or memorable
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.100]   for that you've seen in the history of poker?
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.580]   - Well, for me, the one that stands out
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.620]   and probably because I was so young
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.060]   and it was my first year, like,
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.260]   when I won a bracelet that year,
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.460]   was I was friends with Scotty Wynn, the Prince of Poker.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.980]   And he was heads up against the guy named Kevin McBride.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.900]   And I was on the rail, you know, I'm like, wow,
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.300]   he's gonna, you know, he's heads up.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.500]   And he was so cool.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.940]   Like he had a mullet, but it's perfect, right?
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.660]   He had the white shirt, the black thing.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.540]   He's drinking a Michelob, smoking a cigarette, whatever,
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.140]   you know, all chill.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.980]   He bets it all on the river and the guy's thinking,
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.760]   and he psychologically owned him.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.060]   And he said, he goes with his beer, he goes,
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.740]   "You call, gonna be all over, baby."
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.540]   Ha ha ha, that's right.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:27.100]   Okay, so this guy who was an amateur heard that
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.140]   and was like, there's so much pressure
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.260]   in this moment right now.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.860]   I can't handle this pressure.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.660]   But Scotty just told me if I call here,
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.940]   it's the pressure's gone.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.180]   I don't have to be under it anymore.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.740]   So he sort of hypnotized them into making the call,
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.460]   you know, and Scotty had it.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.220]   Scotty had, you know, the full house
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.220]   and it was over for the guy.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.980]   You call, gonna be all over, baby.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.900]   It was, I just, I love that aspect,
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.340]   sort of the table talk dynamic,
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.800]   which isn't as prevalent today as it was back then.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.220]   But that one sticks out.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.140]   And it probably, because it was one of my first.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:01.140]   - So the few words you say at the table
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:05.100]   can completely affect a hand like that.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.660]   That's almost, that's scary.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.740]   - It was just so cool to me, you know,
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.900]   like just how he was so calm.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.900]   And I think that too added more pressure to the amateur.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.540]   And I think like, again, part of it is,
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.380]   even back then, it was 1998,
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.620]   there's still a big rail of people and there's lights
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.900]   and they're, you know, they're filming
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:23.740]   and all this kind of stuff.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.300]   And it's a lot of pressure for a guy
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.580]   who's never been in this environment.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:31.100]   And now I'm telling you, it can all be over soon.
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.540]   It will all be over soon.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.660]   Just call, it's finished.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.820]   (laughing)
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.140]   - Something about that accent too.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.620]   Now you're a master at table talk as well.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:45.260]   Do you have, do you just kind of go with your gut,
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.140]   you flow with it, or is there a deliberate strategy
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:48.980]   with this sometimes?
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.820]   Like in the-- - There's usually
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.780]   some sort of strategy that I think about
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.380]   in terms of what I want to say and whatnot.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.540]   But a lot of the time, I just go, I go with it, you know?
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.180]   - The more you talk, the more information you get.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:02.020]   - Yeah, but in some cases against really good players,
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.320]   you're just giving away information, right?
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.620]   Like if I'm playing against Phil Ivey,
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:09.020]   I'm not engaging in anything 'cause he can read through it.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.500]   He can sense based on what I'm saying, you know,
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.660]   the clues and where I'm trying to take him.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:16.580]   And he reads through, he sees the tree through the forest
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.660]   or whatever you want to call it,
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.020]   the forest through the trees.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.980]   And, you know, so then I would just be like
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.540]   allowing myself to be exploitable.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.660]   - Is some of it just for fun?
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.420]   Because at the end of the day, if you're having fun,
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.300]   you might be at the top of your game.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.340]   - I've been thinking about this a lot lately, actually.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.500]   It's funny you bring this up
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.940]   because I've been thinking about when I'm at my best.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:39.500]   And I think I'm at my best when I am comfortable like that,
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.940]   right, where I'm not so stiff and worried about, you know,
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.940]   checking properly and worried about reading people.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.460]   I'm like, no, I'm me.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.300]   All right, I'm gonna play some poker.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.140]   What do you want to do?
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:48.960]   You want to call me?
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.940]   Call, go ahead, do what you want, right?
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.780]   'Cause then I realized, you know,
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.100]   ultimately it's like I'm comfortable in that.
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.620]   My opponents aren't as comfortable in that.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.920]   They're comfortable with this.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.260]   You know, the robot thing.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.980]   But I thought more about that and how,
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.940]   especially with some tournaments coming up,
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.900]   I plan on really kind of sort of getting back
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.260]   to my roots in that regard.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.500]   - I love it.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.060]   From a spectator perspective, I love it.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.940]   But it's also interesting whenever you see a Daniel
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.100]   on the ground, a quiet.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.460]   That's an interesting, like,
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:20.920]   like it feels like a calm before a storm of sorts.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.420]   So I'm sure that's also a part of it.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.180]   - Yeah, like I've gone, I've ebb and flowed.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:26.000]   Like I said, you know, I took on some coaches
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.400]   and I was really learning game theory
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.680]   'cause I felt like it was important to always stick,
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.240]   you know, keep up with what's going on.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.520]   And then I do feel like to some degree,
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.440]   it sort of took away a little bit of my own
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.880]   instinctual ideas in terms of what I should be doing.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.720]   Right? - Yeah.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.880]   - So I think like the most dangerous version of myself
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.840]   is a deep understanding of the game theory
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.080]   with my wisdom of many years of,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.280]   and comfort of just sort of like being myself at the table.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.260]   - And being relaxed. - Relaxed.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.620]   - Letting your mind flow.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.320]   Let me ask you the greatest, the goat question,
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.300]   greatest of all time.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.380]   Can you make the case for a few folks?
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.500]   So first you tweeted referring to Phil Ivey as the goat,
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.340]   saying the goat doing goat things.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.740]   That's a recent tweet.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.260]   So can you make the case for Phil Ivey?
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.580]   Or maybe who is the greatest poker player of all time?
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.060]   Would you put Phil?
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.860]   - For me, until someone knocks him off the podium,
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.680]   the king of poker and the goat is Phil Ivey.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.280]   Okay, so and the reason I say that is,
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.540]   I think of poker as more than just one game, right?
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.920]   There's different variants.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.480]   You know, there's Hold'em, Omaha, Stud, Triple Draw,
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.080]   all these different types of games.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.920]   And Phil in every arena has been dominant.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.580]   Whether it was tournament poker, dominated it.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.680]   Mixed game high stakes poker in Bobby's room, dominated.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.920]   Online poker against all the wizards, dominated.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.600]   Made millions in every arena.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.200]   And you know, he sort of took a few years away from poker
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.700]   with his legal troubles and things like that,
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:53.660]   but he's back.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.300]   You know, he's been playing in the high roller series again.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.160]   And you know, he comes from,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.860]   he's cut from a different cloth.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.700]   But he has a tenacity and a focus that's unparalleled,
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.540]   I think.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.460]   When he's in the zone, I mean, for lack,
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:08.080]   and this has nothing to do with race.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.580]   It really has to do with mannerism.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.300]   But he does remind me of like a combination
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.020]   of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.100]   in the way that he approaches it.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.340]   He's very intense.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.180]   - Yeah.
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.060]   - And he outworks everybody, you know?
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.360]   And I think, frankly, a lot of his mannerisms
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.560]   do come from them.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.960]   Because he's young, watching these guys on TV,
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.240]   and a lot of his ways of being, you know,
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.400]   his learned behavior, I think, probably from people like that.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.320]   - People at the top of their sport,
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.080]   and people that are Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.720]   aren't just at the top of their sport,
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.160]   but they kind of dominate the sport.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.440]   There's some kind of aura that--
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.720]   - There's a uniqueness to them.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.440]   They're not built like us.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.740]   They're not, you know, they're not.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:45.200]   Like I wish, I wish I could have the kind of focus
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.560]   that Phil Ivey has, you know,
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.600]   and see everything that he's saying.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.500]   I just, that's not me, you know?
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.340]   I don't have that.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.180]   And he does.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.380]   He has that gene, whatever it is.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.700]   - But they also look like they're not having that much fun.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.180]   They're more focused on the perfection,
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.100]   like a dogged pursuit of perfection.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.860]   - And you know, that might even be true.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.080]   It might not be as fun.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:03.920]   You know, I don't know.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.100]   Like I have fun at the table.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.220]   When you look outwardly, you look at someone,
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.540]   like maybe he is having a blast.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.060]   Maybe that's just the way that he likes it, you know?
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.860]   Like is Tiger Woods having fun when he's like on 17,
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.700]   about to win a major?
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.980]   Doesn't look like it, theoretically.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.280]   - Well, if you look at Michael Jordan,
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.360]   I don't know about Tiger Woods,
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.800]   but I think they're more focused
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.080]   on every single mistake they make.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.960]   I think they're more obsessed about not making a mistake
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.520]   and hating every time they make a mistake.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:34.800]   That's probably like 99% of their mental energy.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.440]   - I think that's part of what makes them great, right?
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.240]   They don't look past the mistake and just let it,
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.080]   it's whatever.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.840]   No, they're like, they wanna correct it.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.680]   And--
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.600]   - Yeah, there's a tension, almost like a trade-off.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.880]   I wonder if that's always the case
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.240]   between sort of greatness and happiness.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.720]   - I remember Huxeed, who, you know,
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.000]   when I was a kid growing up, he was like the poker idol.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.960]   He won the world championship in 1996.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.000]   And I was lucky enough to hang out with him a little bit.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.200]   And he would go through these streaks
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.520]   where he had an A game and he had an F game.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.760]   His A game was unparalleled.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.120]   Nobody could beat him, right?
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.040]   But his F game was so terrible that he was just a fish.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.280]   You know, he was playing terribly.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.320]   And I remember him saying,
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.360]   and it was exactly what you're saying.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.200]   He'd make like one little mistake, right?
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.680]   And then he would go off.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.280]   And I was like, why do you do that?
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.680]   Like, you know, your B game would be just fine.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.840]   He's like, well, if I'm gonna make a mistake,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.540]   what's the point?
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.880]   What's the point, right, of trying?
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.280]   Like, if you can't play perfect,
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.800]   there's no point in playing at all.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.640]   So he was extreme in that regard
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.000]   and the way that he viewed it.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.440]   - And depending on the sport, those folks,
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.360]   like in chess, certainly the case,
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.480]   that kind of mindset can destroy you.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.320]   - Absolutely.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.160]   No, I was totally--
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.720]   - 'Cause a sequence of mistakes,
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.720]   like the kind of year you had with the World Series at Polk,
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.400]   it can completely destroy a human being
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.040]   if you're not able to see the bigger picture of it.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.200]   - Yeah.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.280]   - You said that Phil Ivey's the hardest,
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.360]   your toughest opponent,
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.800]   the toughest person to play against.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.960]   Why is that?
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.720]   And how do you beat him?
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.240]   - Because Phil Ivey's just,
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.840]   he's seeing things that nobody else is seeing, really.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.780]   Like subtle things, where I'm putting my hands,
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.760]   where I'm looking, you know, my pulse,
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.680]   like stuff that I don't even know I'm giving off.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.000]   He's so engaged and so focused
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.800]   and has such a, just a,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.600]   he's fearless, right?
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.160]   A lot of people, you know, they'll play poker
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.000]   and be like, "You know what?
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:20.820]   "I don't think this guy has it."
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.480]   But do they have the guts?
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.360]   Do they have the cojones, if you will,
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.600]   to actually do anything about it, right?
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.680]   And stand up to this person?
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.200]   He does, you know?
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.840]   - I forgot the hand that you tweeted
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.240]   about the goat doing goat things.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.960]   - That wasn't even that big of a goat hand.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.800]   - Yeah, it was pretty impressive.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.280]   - There's hands where like,
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.980]   there was a famous one in Australia
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:43.260]   where the flop was like jack, jack, nine,
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:46.640]   and Phil check raised the flop with six, seven, nothing.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.840]   Just absolutely nothing.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.440]   And the guy re-raised him, right?
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.080]   And Phil just knew.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.800]   He went all in with nothing.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.600]   If the guy calls, he's done, he's cooked.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.240]   But he was so tuned in that this guy's not strong
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.220]   that he just, you know, he did things like that.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:03.400]   And it's tough to play against a guy like that.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.680]   - So he gets great reads and is able to execute on them,
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.280]   has the guts to execute on them.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:12.580]   He's got experience, he's got work ethic.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:16.140]   He also, I think one thing I'm underselling too,
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.200]   is his strategic mind, right?
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.780]   Like I believe that, you know, like I said,
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.620]   the new age player,
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.220]   they learn how to play through a very systematic approach.
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.020]   Okay, let's look at the data.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.060]   Make up a game right now.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.060]   Three cards, we each get three cards.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.020]   Jacks are wild, sixes are, you know,
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.560]   six of hearts is wild, right?
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.820]   Just make up that game.
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.680]   Phil will figure it out intuitively, very, very quickly,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.760]   right, without having the answers for him, right?
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.000]   So that's like the difference
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.740]   between the players of my generation.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.880]   We had to figure this stuff out on our own.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.860]   Today, well, I wanna know the answer,
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.240]   I go ask the computer and the computer tells me.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.720]   So I really believe like if you created a game from scratch
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.160]   that Phil Ivey would be my horse that I wanted to play in.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.520]   - So he's in some sense in tune with some deeper thing.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.200]   - He has what we used to call card sense.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.680]   - Card sense.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.840]   Can you try to make the case for some others
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.920]   like Doyle Brunson, Phil Helmuth, Daniel Negreanu,
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.760]   and maybe one of the modern guys like Justin Bonomo
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.720]   or somebody like that? - Sure.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.940]   Oh, so let's start with Doyle, okay?
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:22.680]   Like what Doyle has going for him above and beyond
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.160]   is twofold, really.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.680]   Longevity, I mean, he's in his late 80s.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.920]   And last time I played with him, I was,
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.480]   I'm like, how is he getting better?
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.040]   Like I really felt like he was playing better
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.600]   than he had, you know, in the previous years.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.040]   But also with Doyle, like Doyle had to figure,
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.880]   you know, we talked about my generation
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.920]   having to figure it on their own.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.040]   I mean, they really had to figure it on their own.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.200]   Like they didn't have any computer simulation
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.720]   to tell you if Ace King was a favorite over pocket sixes.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.560]   They didn't.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.380]   So we know what he did.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.640]   He would take a deck of cards and they would deal out,
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.360]   and they would, with a notepad, right, okay, Ace King won.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.640]   And then they would do like a hundred of them,
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.680]   be like, all right, Ace King won like 53,
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.720]   so it must be a favorite.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.720]   And he did it manually, you know?
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.200]   And he did it in a time when it was very, very difficult.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.160]   And he's seen poker evolve and change throughout the years.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.240]   Now, listen, is he gonna be able to compete
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.400]   against the top players in the world today?
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.960]   Absolutely not, you know?
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.680]   But how many people, he's the best 88 year old player
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.400]   in the world by a mile, okay?
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.640]   That's not even close.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.120]   And Doyle, again, he's another guy who plays all the games.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.840]   He's played high stakes cash, tournaments, you name it.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.800]   He's iconic, you know, he's the godfather.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.480]   - But there's also an element to that,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.520]   so the iconic element, like your personality in poker.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.360]   I mean, not to romanticize this thing too much,
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.240]   but poker is also a game of personalities.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.920]   I mean, it's part of the greatness
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.040]   is like the uniqueness of the human being.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.200]   - Yeah, I think also, yeah.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.080]   I mean, if you'd like looking at it from that perspective
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.340]   in terms of like goat,
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.320]   like goat in terms of what you represent,
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.400]   like the cowboy, the godfather, you know?
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.840]   He's been around, you know, he played in the '60s
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.680]   and stuff like that.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.420]   It's just something like incredibly cool.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.400]   Like I often think about if I could go back in time
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.280]   and like visit an era,
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.200]   I'd love to go like to Vegas in the '70s.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.080]   And just like, I can think of what it would smell like,
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.320]   probably not ideal, cigarettes and the leather jackets
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.360]   and just the vibe of what it must've been like
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.840]   with the mobsters and things like that.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.160]   And you know, he's lived through all that,
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.400]   all the cool movies we've seen.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.600]   Like Doyle talks about some of those films
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.200]   and he's like, yeah, that guy,
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.140]   he said he was gonna stab me in my stomach.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.880]   You know, he knows these people.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.280]   It was, he's like a source of history, really.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.720]   - Yeah, when poker was a game for the mob
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.520]   and the degenerates and all that kind of stuff
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.440]   before it transitioned into professional sport.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.100]   - Yeah. - Professional game.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.720]   Yeah, so he was there through the whole thing.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.840]   He's been there through the whole transition.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.800]   - He's seen it all, yeah.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.160]   - Yeah, and then to the online world.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.840]   So what about,
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.920]   (laughs)
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.800]   I can't even say it without smiling, Phil Hellmuth.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.760]   - Okay, so Phil, here's the thing with Phil.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.520]   He takes it very personal when I say this.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.080]   And he doesn't hear the compliment.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.600]   He only hears the negativity.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.760]   'Cause Phil wants to be considered
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.520]   the greatest of all time. - Hashtag positive.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.400]   - He wants to be the greatest of all time.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.080]   But I'm like, Phil, here's the facts.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.160]   You have the best, absolute greatest resume
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.360]   at the World Series of Poker of anyone in the world.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.000]   Is that not enough, right?
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:14.900]   That's what you have.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.240]   You have that, right?
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.720]   Now, do I think you're the best
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.340]   no limit hold'em player in the world today?
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:20.180]   No.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.840]   Do I think that you can play high stakes mixed games
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.440]   with the best players in the world today and win?
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.360]   No, right?
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   So he wouldn't get as much flack on this topic
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.640]   if he wasn't so boastful and demanding.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.200]   You never hear Phil Ivey say, "I'm the best in the world."
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.760]   His peers do, right?
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.160]   But Phil wants to make the claim,
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.040]   and I simply say, "I beg to differ."
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:40.880]   Right?
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.840]   I beg to differ.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.440]   I don't think you are the best player in the world.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.320]   - If we can linger on the compliments so he can hear it,
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.440]   what makes him so good?
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.800]   Because it seems like a lot of times
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.680]   his play is not optimal.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.880]   - Yeah, he definitely has his own brand and style of play.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.720]   Right?
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.540]   He does not adhere to,
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.760]   he's never used a solver in his life.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.160]   He doesn't know, he's not in that world, right?
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.760]   Phil does, Phil has a lot of faith
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.300]   and a lot of confidence in what he does
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.520]   and that it will be successful.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.120]   And I think there's something to be said about that.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:09.960]   Right?
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.640]   He doesn't ever lack in belief that he can win,
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.880]   and he finds a way to do it his way.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.200]   And frankly, a lot of what he does is very effective
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.600]   against specific types of players
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.680]   who are intimidated by him,
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.600]   by whether it's his resume or his demeanor
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.040]   or his attitude sometimes.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:27.880]   Right?
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.720]   Like if you're an average player
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.800]   and then you beat Phil in a hand, you're gonna hear it.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.400]   This idiot from Northern Europe and beat me in this pot.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.160]   Like, and for some people, they don't like that.
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.800]   So he can use that against them.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   But I also think too, like he cares so much.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.120]   Right?
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.440]   And that leads to trying really, really hard.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.880]   Like he sees these moments and he doesn't phone them in.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.440]   Like whatever brand of poker he plays,
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.280]   he tries his best at all times to succeed and to win.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.120]   And there's something to be said.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.080]   Even though like he's fundamentally flawed
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.040]   in a lot of things that he does
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.840]   compared to some of the bigger players,
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.200]   his effort and will and like his determination
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.480]   to stick around is up there.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.240]   - And he is somebody who seems to really hate losing.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.080]   - Yes.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:17.280]   He feels like he deserves to win.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.120]   - Yeah.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:18.960]   - Right?
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.780]   In all cases.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:22.000]   And if he loses, it's not just.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.880]   - As he joked around that you and him
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.760]   might do an anger management.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.600]   (laughing)
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.720]   - Yeah, he said that in one video.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.560]   - Course.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.680]   Now this is tough because you're a humble guy,
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.440]   but objectively speaking,
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.880]   can you say what your strengths are?
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.800]   You're often listed as one of,
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.380]   if not the greatest player of all time.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.120]   So what are the things that make you stand out?
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.360]   - So for me, when I grew up,
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.280]   I admired the big cash game players.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.120]   'Cause that's what I was.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.320]   I love tournaments, but I wanted to be well-rounded.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.760]   Like in my day, you couldn't make the Poker Hall of Fame
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.240]   if you just played one game.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.720]   You had to jump in to the high stakes games
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.160]   in Bobby's room, as they say.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.000]   Right?
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:00.920]   And I was able to do that.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.600]   When I was in my early, in my mid twenties,
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.000]   I was playing 4,000, 8,000 limits.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.100]   You know, you could win or lose a million dollars in a day.
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:09.200]   So I grinded it out.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.160]   Like a lot of people think, oh, you know, he's lucky.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.520]   He's had sponsorship.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.360]   Otherwise he'd be broke.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.440]   He's like, I built multi-million dollar bank rolls
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.000]   before any of that stuff existed.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.160]   And I did it the good old fashioned way
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.720]   by sitting my butt on the table.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.060]   I think probably one of my biggest strengths
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:25.600]   is self-awareness.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:29.080]   And in that regard, a level of humility
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.980]   that always allows me to say, okay, well, you know what?
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.480]   In this case with these players, they're better than me.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.840]   So what am I gonna learn from them?
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.680]   Right?
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.040]   Rather than have this need to say,
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040]   I am the best because of history.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.520]   I'm always looking to guys and go, wow,
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.440]   he does this really well.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.600]   Whether it's the Adamos or the Ivys or whoever it may be.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.000]   So my willingness to adapt, I think,
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.040]   and stay relevant by learning what the young guys
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.760]   are learning is something I've always done.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.160]   And I also pride myself on, again, being well-rounded,
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.240]   like playing all the games.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.580]   Like I don't feel intimidated in any game,
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.440]   you know, whatever the format is.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.960]   - So always being a scholar of the game
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.760]   as the game evolves, as the different games evolve,
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.160]   the different players evolve, the culture evolves,
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.920]   always adjusting by being a scholar,
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.760]   having the humility to be a scholar.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:18.000]   - A healthy respect for, a healthy respect
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.120]   for the younger generation, how they learn,
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.320]   what they learn, and what they can teach me.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.280]   Rather than poo-poo it.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.600]   And say, oh, these kids today.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.760]   'Cause that's what a lot of people,
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.560]   like the Mike Mattisos and the Phil Hellmuths,
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.500]   my generation, they just poo-poo it
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.040]   because they don't understand it.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.560]   On a level of one to 10, their level of understanding
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.740]   of this is like a one, maybe.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.560]   If I'm being generous by calling it a one.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.400]   They really don't understand it, so they poo-poo it.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.220]   Right?
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.060]   It's easy to do that.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.040]   Like, oh, that's not how I do it,
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.540]   so that's wrong or that's stupid or whatever.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:47.560]   I don't take that approach.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.680]   I go, well, let me learn.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.520]   Let me see what there is to this.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.120]   - But that said, the crankiness that Mattisos
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.200]   and Phil Hellmuth have is great to watch,
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.480]   especially when they're at a table with you.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.320]   - Oh, I love it, yeah.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.520]   It's a blast, it's a blast.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.600]   - You're masterful at being able to get under their skin.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.320]   What about somebody from the new school,
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.320]   like Justin Bonomo, who's leading in terms of cash wins?
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.000]   Is there somebody like that that stands out to you
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.540]   as a potential GOAT status person?
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.140]   - Yeah, so there's two different ones,
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:23.120]   but one is very, so they're both just no limit, right?
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.960]   So I, like, again, when I think of poker,
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.940]   I think of a variety of games,
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.220]   but there's so many of the young guys that specialize.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.280]   Michael Adamo is one that I've mentioned several times,
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.720]   and I love the way that he approaches the game.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.200]   Another one that's highly respected
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.080]   because of his online prowess and his,
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.540]   people have looked at how close he is to game theory,
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.320]   and they say he's about as perfect as you get,
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.320]   and it's a kid named Linus, Linus Love Online, Linus Lingard.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.900]   So he just came second recently, I believe,
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.100]   in the Triton, huge Triton event.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:52.620]   - So he's primarily an online player.
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.380]   - Yeah, he's an online cash player for the most part,
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.420]   but he plays some live.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:58.740]   And he's, again, and I respect the peers that I play with
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.700]   who say, yeah, he's tough as nails.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.980]   There's another kid too, Russian kid,
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.500]   named Timofey Kuznetsov, and he plays all the games,
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.540]   and he's well-respected in that regard.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.900]   And same with a guy like Jungleman, Dan Cates,
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.340]   who's a unique personality.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.000]   I mean, this guy showed up, won the Poker Players
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.480]   Championship back-to-back years
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.820]   in a Randy Macho Man Savage costume,
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:23.240]   and he was doing Macho Man the entire time.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.480]   Oh yeah, I'm gonna take all the chips like I did last year,
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:29.440]   bust 'em all, and he was in character
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.280]   for the entirety of the tournament.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.040]   - This is great. - Just unique.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.040]   But yeah, I respect for a lot of those guys.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.920]   - Is it gonna take time to figure out
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:40.160]   who stands the test of time?
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.440]   - That's the thing, right?
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.280]   So a lot of these kids, like there was a guy
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:46.600]   who beat me heads up in the Million Dollar One Drop.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.880]   I got 8.7, he won $15 million, kid named Dan Coleman.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.440]   He was seen as the next big thing in poker, right?
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:56.200]   He made his money, just wasn't for him.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.180]   So he's moved on to doing what he's doing,
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.080]   skiing in the Alps, whatever.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.360]   We have nobody seen him in five, six years,
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.660]   so that can happen, right?
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.040]   Because there is a lot of burnout.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.240]   I think it was actually Gotham Chess
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.320]   who mentioned something about how difficult it is to,
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.160]   I think it's true in poker.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.080]   When you get really, really good at something,
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.960]   to get this much better takes so much work.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.760]   And a lot of people don't necessarily
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.480]   wanna put in that kind of work in order to do that.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.600]   - That's just even staying at the same level
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.200]   takes a huge amount of work.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.560]   - Like so if you wanna get better at chess,
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.640]   you're already like really, really good
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.600]   and you're trying to get like one little bit better.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.600]   You have to study like in a ridiculous amount.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.040]   You know, and again, that's once you've already had,
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.520]   I think the toughest thing for anybody,
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.960]   once you've tasted success
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.820]   and you've already achieved it,
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.800]   staying hungry, staying on the top.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.680]   Reaching the top is much easier than it is to stay there.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.000]   - Yeah.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.360]   Over years, what's your training regimen in poker
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   in terms of how you keep improving?
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.760]   So you said you study games,
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:03.600]   but that's mostly leading up to a particular tournament.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.800]   But is there kind of a behind the scenes daily activity
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.560]   you try to do that kind of over time keeps you sharp?
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.980]   - So for me, now that I'm 47,
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:17.340]   and I feel like the predominant aspect of my poker game
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.240]   is going to be in terms of my success
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.600]   is gonna be my mental state, right?
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600]   So I find it's really, really important for me
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.720]   now at this age to have balance.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.720]   So when I'm not playing poker and I'm out of it,
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.360]   poker's not even on my radar.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.360]   - You're able to remove it from your mind.
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:37.200]   - Doing my fantasy hockey, play a little chess,
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.040]   you know, play some golf, watch some hockey,
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.440]   whatever the case may be,
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.720]   outside of the game.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:43.820]   And then I start to get the itch.
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.680]   Like after the World Series of Poker,
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.960]   the poker door was closed.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.280]   - Yeah, you took some time off.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.440]   - All of August, I didn't play any poker at all
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.640]   until just recent.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.440]   You know, I started to get the itch again.
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.800]   'Cause that's what's important for me
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.240]   is if I don't have the itch and I don't want to play poker,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.720]   then I'm not gonna be at my best.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.440]   Once I start getting the itch,
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.400]   that's when I start to say,
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.560]   "Okay, let's start watching some of these streams.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.740]   "Let's see what my opponents are up to lately.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.220]   "And, you know, let's look at some solvers
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.980]   "and different things like that."
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.400]   - And you're doing pretty good.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.380]   You came back and doing pretty good.
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.240]   - Yeah, so far.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.600]   - Do you like being in front of the camera?
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:21.640]   Through the hell of the World Series of Poker this year,
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.200]   you filmed every single day.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.320]   You did a vlog.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.400]   Does that energize you?
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.240]   Is that exhausting?
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.400]   'Cause it's really beneficial to a huge amount of people.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.560]   It energizes the poker community.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.180]   But do you see it as a service
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.680]   or do you purely just love it?
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.280]   - I've been comfortable on camera since I was a kid.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.140]   When I was a kid, I wanted to be an actor.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.400]   Like really, really young.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.960]   And it was always comfortable in that environment.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:45.780]   And I think like that gives me a little bit of advantage
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.920]   sometimes too with these filmed events.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.280]   'Cause I'm comfortable with a mic on
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.900]   and on camera with the lights.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.440]   And I think a lot of people maybe aren't
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.920]   with the knowledge that other people
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.440]   are gonna see what they're doing every day.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.140]   So it's been so comfortable and easy for me
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.720]   as far as the World Series goes
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.720]   and the vlogs and all the shooting.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.280]   It's kind of therapeutic for me.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.560]   It is essentially my version of journaling, right?
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.060]   So there's a lot of value, I think,
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.160]   in like at the end of a day doing a brain dump
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.920]   where you just write out and journal.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.520]   But doing it on camera has a similar effect.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.640]   And it also, when you make a mistake on your own,
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.880]   you're held accountable to you.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:23.320]   But when I have to explain it to others,
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.280]   like here's what I did and this is the mistake I made
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.680]   or whatever the case may be,
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.040]   it actually, I think that helps me.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.160]   - Yeah, so you're held responsible by a larger audience.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.680]   - Yeah, I think 'cause like I said,
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.440]   listen, I'm 47, my life is good.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.600]   I don't have to be in this tournament.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.960]   If I'm over it, I can just dump my chips off and go home.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.280]   But I can't when I'm doing the vlog.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.120]   Like I have to actually answer to that, you know?
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.080]   And it keeps me in line.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.960]   - How hard is it to win the main event
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.240]   of the World Series of Poker?
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.640]   - So the main event of the World Series of Poker
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.360]   is the hardest event to win
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.680]   simply because of the sheer size of it.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.360]   You're talking 7,000, 8,000 players, right?
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.440]   And a lot of landmines.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.840]   And frankly, there are so many players
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.840]   you've not played with before too.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.880]   You play these high roller events, like the super ones,
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.360]   you get 30, 40 people, you know everybody, right?
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.880]   So you have an idea.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.240]   You sit at the main event, you don't know, have any idea.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.040]   This guy wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.240]   and sunglasses and you just raised your big,
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.120]   I don't know this guy, I don't know what he's about.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.280]   So there's a lot of like, it's grueling too.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:32.520]   You're seven, eight days where you're in the blender,
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.240]   as you might say.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.120]   - So what's the structure?
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.640]   So it's $10,000 buy-in or something like that.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.960]   And there's a bunch of tables and you just keep playing.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.800]   Like when is it over for a single table?
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.080]   - So the way that it works is this.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.840]   So there's, let's say 8,000 players.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.160]   And the way the main event works, unique to others,
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.220]   is there's various day ones you can play, right?
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.160]   So a day one, you're gonna play from noon
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.320]   till like midnight, right?
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.040]   If you're still in, you bag up your chips
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.080]   and you'll come back for day two, okay?
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.360]   There's four different day ones, right?
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.040]   Now they'll all combine essentially to play on a day two.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.800]   And at the end of the night, they redraw the tables.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.140]   So you don't just win your table.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.680]   If players get knocked out, tables break,
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.280]   they continue to be replaced.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:18.120]   So you start with 8,000, then after day one,
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.960]   you've got 6,000, then you do the same.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.360]   You play like a 12-hour day and you slowly whittle down.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.520]   Day three, day four, you're in the money.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.840]   And then you continue to progress.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.480]   And then what they do now with the final table is,
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.360]   because they were trying to do this for TV,
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.760]   these final tables can take 12 hours to play.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.080]   And what we were finding was,
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.560]   you start the thing at 5 p.m. and it goes till 8 a.m.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.960]   and nobody's watching anymore.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.320]   So they separate into three days now.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320]   And so you're talking now,
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.120]   it's like six, seven days to get to the final table
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.640]   and another three days to play it.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.840]   So you're grinding for a week and a half.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:01.880]   - But most of the time, you're playing against people
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.840]   you've never played against before.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.880]   - Especially early on, yeah.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.920]   And then by the end, who knows?
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.560]   Rarely do you see, you see in the last 100,
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.480]   you usually see some notable names.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.760]   Then in the last 27, you might see one, maybe two.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.440]   Final table, maybe one.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.080]   But often it's gonna be some players
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.040]   you've never heard of before.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:23.240]   - Is there strategies that maximize
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.440]   your likelihood of having a chance?
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.560]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.000]   I think the World Series of Poker main event
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.400]   is a unique animal in that,
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.360]   we talk about game theory and all that kind of stuff.
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.160]   If you're focused on that when you're playing,
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:36.660]   you're really not playing well.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:38.280]   You need to just exploit
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.600]   because you're gonna have a lot of people
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.520]   who see this as a bucket list item.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.480]   They just wanna play the main event in the World Series
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.520]   and they might be scared,
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.880]   they might be nervous or whatever.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.760]   You don't have to worry about being balanced.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.520]   Oh, I have to make sure that I'm balanced.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.360]   No, you don't.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.240]   You're playing with this guy now for three hours,
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.720]   you might never see him again.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.040]   So just make the play that makes sense for you.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.000]   So yeah, I approach that event
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.640]   very differently than I would
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.760]   like playing against the high roller players
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.600]   that I play with.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.200]   - Does that mean more aggressive, essentially?
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.760]   - Less, actually.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.880]   So when you play against really good players,
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.440]   you have to take small plus EV scenarios
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.000]   where you push the envelope
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.120]   and you're playing really aggressive,
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.440]   you're bluffing off your stack.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.280]   You gotta do this.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.720]   You gotta focus a little bit more on being balanced
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.440]   'cause otherwise, you're not gonna beat these guys.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.120]   Whereas if you're playing with amateurs
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.800]   and you're playing with regular players,
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.200]   for the most part, risking all your chips on a bluff,
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.720]   probably don't need to do that.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.760]   You don't need to do that nearly as much.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.360]   You can probably slowly but surely build your stack
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.960]   without taking those high risk, high variant situations
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:44.080]   'cause you'll find better situations.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.240]   - What mistakes do amateurs usually make
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.720]   in tournaments like that?
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.160]   Are they over bluffing?
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.320]   - Well, I think amateurs generally,
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.200]   the biggest mistake they make
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.280]   is they think that pros are bluffing more than they are.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.960]   So like a pro will bet all his chips on the end
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.840]   and they're like, "Ah, I don't know.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.320]   "Maybe it's Phil Ivey.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.440]   "Maybe he's doing some crazy stuff."
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.840]   He's like, "Probably not.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.280]   "He's probably just got it."
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.960]   - And then they lose all their money by calling
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.580]   and going all in as well.
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:15.040]   And so the right thing is to be more patient.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.080]   So amateur is too impatient or just bad reads.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.120]   - So all the amateurs are built different.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.400]   Some of the amateurs are just too weak and passive.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.440]   They're just waiting for the nuts.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.320]   And then the pros, everyone notices that.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.160]   And then when they make their big hand,
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.600]   they don't get paid anyway.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.800]   So in order to win the main event,
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.400]   I mean, you have to have some components of your game
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.480]   that are aggressive.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.920]   It's very unlikely to expect to just get the cards
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.400]   the whole way and just always have the best hand.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.520]   You're gonna have to find ways to win pots
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.040]   that where you don't have the best hand.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.600]   - How do you win the final table?
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.200]   - The final table is unique now,
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.160]   especially because you're talking about
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.640]   the way that poker works in tournaments
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.880]   is that if there's seven people left
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.560]   and you're very short on chips,
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.520]   but if one other player goes out,
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.640]   you just make like $300,000 for folding,
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.760]   like just for sitting out.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.680]   The term for that that kids use is ICM,
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.280]   independent chip model,
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.460]   where it talks about the value of each chip.
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:17.440]   Where what happens, what we see now is,
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.600]   let's say one guy has a big chip lead
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.320]   and there's another guy who's second in chips
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.760]   and there's a couple that are short.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.960]   These guys in the middle, they just play super tight
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.320]   and they wait for the little guys to go
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.640]   while the big stack is just pounding them
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.560]   because he can afford to, right?
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.040]   He knows that people are handcuffed.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.880]   So let's say I had 10 million in chips
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.280]   and you have 9 million in chips
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.200]   and these guys have little chips.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.080]   If I go in on you, are you gonna call me
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.360]   and risk like guaranteed pay jumps
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.720]   of like moving up a few spots?
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.580]   So really the question comes down to like,
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.480]   are you the type of guy who just wants to inch up
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.960]   or are you gonna go for it
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.040]   and you're gonna go for the win?
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.000]   I think ultimately there's some value
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:56.840]   in being the guy who says,
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.600]   "You know, I don't care if I come seventh.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.400]   "I'm not worried about going from seventh to fifth.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:02.600]   "I'm here to win."
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.840]   And so you're saying like the guys that win
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.120]   will often be the ones that call there.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.120]   So like they're not just bullying the small stacks.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:10.960]   They're--
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.520]   Well, they're the ones that are willing to risk it, right?
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.840]   So there are some people who, you know,
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.240]   if there's five left, you know, and they're third in chips
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.360]   and there's two guys very short
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.280]   and you, you know, they'll have ace king
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.080]   and someone moves, they'll just fold.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.760]   They fold the hand because they wanna wait
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.620]   for those two other players to get broke
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.280]   and that way they let you know, they make actual money.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.640]   So you, I guess the thought process
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.280]   between winning first place
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.440]   and winning the most amount of money are different.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.240]   They're conflicting, right?
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.360]   Because in order to like win the,
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.840]   if you're just, if your focus is only
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.680]   on winning the tournament,
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.040]   you will make mistakes financially
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.680]   where you had guaranteed income for just folding, right?
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.540]   Let's say a guy has one chip left, you know, one chip
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:53.320]   and me and you have good chips
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.240]   and I go all in with you and I lose.
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.840]   Now that guy, you know, got the guaranteed, you know,
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:59.440]   he got the pay jump that I wouldn't have got.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.200]   So there's some extremely stupid mistakes you can make
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.720]   from a financial perspective, but it's often at odds with,
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.520]   you know, giving yourself the best chance
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.800]   to actually come first.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.240]   - And in a tournament, especially the main event,
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:15.080]   especially the final table, it's all about coming in first.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.520]   - Well, I know because most of the people who make it,
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.400]   so like, you know, when you play these high rollers,
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.280]   these guys are accustomed to playing for a hundred thousand
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.020]   to they're accustomed to this kind of money.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.220]   So they're gonna play, right?
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.740]   For the most, but you're talking about guys
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.220]   who bought into a $10,000 tournament,
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.580]   maybe never had a hundred K cash in their life.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:32.500]   And now they're sitting there and it's like 1 million
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.300]   for fifth and 2 million for fourth.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.380]   So like, they don't wanna be fit.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.620]   They're just gonna sit there and go, ah, I don't want.
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.740]   So they'll be under more financial pressure
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:45.100]   because they're not like your typical high roller type player
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.920]   - Are you still able to find the guts to take big risks?
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.780]   - Yeah, see, I'm trying to win.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:53.180]   Like, I think that gives me an advantage, frankly,
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.860]   where I might make decisions that are financially
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:58.900]   suboptimal because I'm trying to win,
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.040]   but there's also an inherent advantage to that.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.020]   Like that, again, something I watched and learned
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:07.200]   from a guy like Michael Adama, where he takes advantage
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.660]   of these people playing so passively in these spots
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:11.900]   where he's like, I'm not trying to come, I'm gonna win.
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:14.140]   I'm just gonna bulldoze you.
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:16.160]   'Cause I'm not worried about, you know,
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:21.160]   the small financial mistake of, you know, a pay jump.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:25.560]   - What advice could you give to beginning poker players?
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.760]   Actually at every level, how to get better,
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.040]   how to improve, how to improve their game.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.640]   Obviously, as you said, it's easiest to get better
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.040]   in the beginning, but what advice would you give
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.320]   how to get better?
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.000]   - So one of the ways, I mean, I think way back
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.200]   to the how I started, right?
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.480]   And there's so many resources and tools available right now
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.940]   to analyze hands, but when you play, right?
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:48.400]   And you find yourself in a situation or a hand
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:51.080]   that you're not really sure about, not because you had aces
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.560]   and went all in and you lost, like that's not interesting,
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.200]   but an interesting situation where you're not sure
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.200]   what you did, jot the hand down, write it out.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.000]   And then either A, you know, use some of the tools,
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.920]   whether it's the solvers, if you're, you know,
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.240]   advanced enough, or ask your group, you know,
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.040]   like have a couple of friends at your level
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.760]   and talk through the different decisions
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.640]   and start to learn that way, right?
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.620]   'Cause those mistakes that you make or those tough hands,
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:17.280]   that's where the real learning comes from.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.720]   Like, so that, so basically if you're,
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.480]   'cause you're gonna be in similar scenarios.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.320]   In poker, you're rarely gonna have the identical situation,
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.540]   but you'll have situations that are similar.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.600]   You know, you raised with ace king, someone three bet,
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.760]   another guy goes all in.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.800]   Okay, well, what do I do in that spot?
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.400]   You know, it's, you're gonna have similar situations
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.240]   in the future as well.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.140]   So figuring that out, the more you can do that,
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:42.400]   you chop away at, you know, different strategical mistakes,
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.980]   you know, you used to make that you no longer make.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:47.440]   - Are there resources like your masterclass is really,
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.000]   is great, are there books?
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.840]   - So there was a guy named Michael Acevedo.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:54.200]   This is my, again, for a little bit more advanced players,
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.220]   but it's a book called "Modern Poker Theory,"
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:00.520]   I think it's called, which sort of explains game theory,
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.840]   right, to the novice, right?
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:05.300]   So it's a little bit, I think if you're new to poker,
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:08.360]   it's probably above the rim for you.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.960]   But once you start to get a little better
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.600]   and you wanna understand how to do it,
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.360]   it's probably a good resource for as far as books.
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.860]   And there's also like tons of people who stream poker,
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.940]   professional players, and then you can get in there
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.780]   and you get in on the chat and you start talking,
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.660]   you ask them and you see people, you know,
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:23.860]   explaining their thought process and things like that.
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.320]   There's so many free resources.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.320]   And of course my masterclass, I think does a good job
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.520]   of sort of compartmentalizing, like, you know,
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.400]   how to attack it on a deeper level.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.580]   And we, you know, we get it, I try to get into,
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:36.820]   what's funny when I did the masterclass,
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.780]   I asked them, I was like, well, you know,
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:41.620]   how high end do you want this in terms of poker?
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.940]   And they're like, we want really, really high end.
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.440]   And I was like, oh, sure.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.020]   Then I started to explain really, really high end,
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.140]   and they're like, okay, well, maybe the one below that.
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.620]   (both laughing)
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:50.460]   Right?
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:54.900]   So I try to explain really complex, you know,
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:58.780]   theory in a more palatable way, in English, if you will.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:00.260]   'Cause some of these kids, you hear them talk
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:02.180]   and you'd be like, huh?
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.780]   - But you also, which is really nice,
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:08.500]   give example hands that really illustrate a point,
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.540]   which is really nice.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:13.500]   You also wrote a book, I think 10 years ago,
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.880]   Power Hold'em Strategy.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.220]   It's interesting to think how much of the stuff
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:21.340]   in that book still applies, how much doesn't.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:23.740]   - Listen, I still think the book holds up to a certain degree.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:26.420]   Obviously, like, you know, it isn't optimal
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.380]   because there's like a more advanced strategies.
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:29.300]   And if you played that way,
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:30.940]   people will figure out a way to exploit you.
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.340]   But if you're like an average player
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:34.380]   playing an average buy-ins, like that's sort of
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:36.820]   what I coined like small ball approach,
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.820]   absolutely will work, you know?
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.940]   At the highest level, you have to add much more,
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:42.380]   a lot more bluffing.
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:44.640]   But overall, I think it's still, you know,
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.820]   for the most part, there's a lot of really,
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:46.660]   especially with tournaments,
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.960]   there's a lot of really good principles in the book.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.740]   - What's the difference in the dynamics,
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:53.980]   if you could just comment on, between a heads up poker
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:56.540]   and when multiple people are in one hand?
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.060]   What are interesting aspects,
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.160]   everything we've been talking about,
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.500]   from game theory to exploitative strategies,
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.660]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:06.100]   - So the biggest difference when you play,
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.740]   let's say nine handed, you know,
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:09.740]   against eight other players and you know,
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:13.740]   heads up is, first of all, just the type of hands
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:15.220]   and the number of hands you're gonna have to play.
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:18.180]   So the way that it works is if there's nine people,
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:20.340]   two out of the nine hands, you have to put in money.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.820]   And the other seven, you could just fold for nothing, okay?
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:23.860]   When your head's up,
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:27.460]   you're forced to put money in every single hand, okay?
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:29.780]   And there's only one other hand in front of you,
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.780]   which means the ranges of hands that you play
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.500]   is way wider, right?
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.100]   So if you're nine handed, right?
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:36.000]   And you're in first position,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.940]   and you're like, all right, what do I need to play?
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.900]   Like a good pair, you know, two high cards,
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:43.460]   suited, a big ace, you know, stuff like that.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:44.300]   That's it, right?
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.400]   That's what you're gonna play, right?
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.700]   And you're gonna fold all the rest.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.680]   When your head's up, you look at a king and a two,
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.460]   and you're like, well, I gotta play this.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.940]   You know, you're gonna, you're forced to play
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:57.480]   a lot more hands in a lot more complex situations
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.940]   when you're playing heads up,
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.600]   because you're gonna be playing much far weaker hands.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.540]   Queen five, jack three, all these types of hands.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.620]   And you're gonna see flops where you're not gonna have
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.020]   the luxury of being like, I'm in there with a premium hand.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:13.140]   Queens, kings, aces, those are easier to play, right?
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.740]   Very, very strong holdings.
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:19.420]   Heads up, you're forced to dance and fight a lot more.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.600]   You know, you can't sit in the weeds and wait.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.740]   What do you enjoy more?
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:25.760]   Heads up is very intense.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.180]   I like heads up, but I think if you had to play
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:32.020]   heads up eight, 10 hours, it's so mentally draining,
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.820]   'cause your face with so many constant decisions,
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.060]   each and every spot, like you play nine handed,
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.220]   you look at a nine and a three, you throw it away,
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:41.620]   you hang out for a bit, you relax, you get a little break,
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:42.460]   and then play a hand.
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:44.060]   Heads up, you're like, it's like, boom, boom.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:45.060]   It's like you're in the ring.
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.060]   You know, you're in the octagon,
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:49.100]   and you're facing like haymakers nonstop.
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:53.740]   - Since we talked about online a bit,
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:57.260]   is it possible to cheat in poker, especially online?
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.380]   We offline also talked about the cheating controversy
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:02.140]   that's going on in the chess world.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.660]   Is it possible to use, what is it,
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:10.980]   remotely connected anal beads to somehow cheat?
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:11.820]   No.
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:15.820]   Is that a concern of cheating online?
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:17.340]   - So here's the thing.
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:19.860]   It's kind of like romanticized from the old days,
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:22.220]   like in the Westerns and stuff, like people trying to cheat.
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:24.140]   - And have you ever killed a man because he cheated?
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.980]   - No, I have not, but when I started out as a teenager,
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:28.820]   I played in a game with a bunch of Italians,
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:31.180]   and I knew they cheated, and I didn't care,
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.740]   'cause they were so bad that I could win anyway.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.820]   I was like, I knew they would cheat,
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:35.740]   but I knew how they were cheating,
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.180]   so I was like, all right, you guys suck.
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:38.020]   But so here's the thing.
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:41.020]   Anytime you're talking about large sums of money,
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:43.620]   there will be people looking to take advantage,
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:45.940]   whether that's live or online, right?
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:50.940]   And so it's like the job essentially of the online operators
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.620]   or the live event staff to police it the best they can,
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:57.340]   and the players themselves being on the lookout for it.
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.980]   Like a guy like Dole Brunson's a great resource
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:01.820]   'cause he's seen it all, and he's seen all the tricks.
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:04.500]   And so live, he probably could spot a few things.
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:07.540]   But online, there's various ways people can try to cheat,
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:11.620]   but there's also really good security measures
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.420]   in place to catch 'em.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:16.700]   And we've caught, about two years ago,
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:20.460]   there was a huge undertaking of like 500 accounts
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:22.740]   that were banned for doing different things.
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:26.060]   And again, they can't go into detail
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:27.880]   in terms of how they're doing it,
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.460]   'cause otherwise, then you're sort of giving the cheats
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:32.620]   the playbook in terms of how to take advantage.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.620]   But it's always gonna be a concern for poker
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:36.700]   wherever you play, right?
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:40.340]   But it's not something I'm worried about personally.
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.500]   - So at the highest in-person, and by the way,
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.540]   online, there's really interesting algorithms
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.700]   that do some of the work in an automated way
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:50.100]   to detect, to flag things that are weird.
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:51.900]   But in-person, it's just not something
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:54.260]   at the highest level that you're super concerned about.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:58.160]   So it's not, it didn't quite infiltrate the poker world
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.080]   to a degree where it's a huge concern.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.760]   - Yeah, so here's the thing.
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:04.080]   I don't play in private games and whatever, right?
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.880]   But in private games, theoretically,
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.880]   you could be, if you don't trust the people
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.940]   you're playing with, like I've heard stories of people
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:13.440]   where they have an earpiece in that you can't see, right?
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:18.040]   And they have RFID on the cards or something like that,
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:19.880]   and they have a phone reading it,
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.480]   so they have somebody in a truck telling 'em,
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.120]   you're gonna win this hand, you're gonna lose this hand.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:24.860]   Like that happened in a private game.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:26.700]   You know, and the guy, what's often funny
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.200]   about some of these people who cheat
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:31.140]   is they're so greedy and blatantly obvious
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.420]   that they get caught.
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:35.120]   Where if they use this tool in a more subtle way,
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.320]   they could probably continue to get away with it.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.620]   But again, that's not something I worry about
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:42.100]   in a casino environment, you know,
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:43.860]   in these tournaments and things like that.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.820]   But if I was playing in private games,
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:48.180]   like if I came down to Texas and some guy,
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:50.260]   I got cheated in a game by a guy named
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:52.640]   Blacky Blackburn and Tex.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.480]   - That's a red flag right there.
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.460]   - I was at the Chimo Hotel, I was a teenager,
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.740]   and they saw me playing, you know,
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:58.420]   I was making good money as a teenager.
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.820]   I had like a $13,000 bankroll, you know,
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:02.060]   and I went and played in this game with them
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:04.220]   in a private hotel room and found out later
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.400]   that the guy was a card mechanic.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.140]   You know, he was dealing and he could, you know,
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:09.620]   deal you the hands and he knew what you had
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:10.700]   and stuff like that. - Ah, God.
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:12.140]   - So yeah, I remember, you know,
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.500]   I lost a big number in that game
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.660]   and it was a good learning lesson
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:18.380]   in terms of, you know, being wary of who you trust.
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:22.180]   - Yeah, so if the dealer is in on it,
[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:23.880]   that's one way you could cheat.
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.280]   It's fascinating. - That's part of the reason
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:27.480]   that they cut.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:30.820]   So like, you'll see like, there's a burn card
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.180]   because what would happen, you know,
[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.700]   maybe in the old days is like,
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:34.740]   if you're sitting in the one seat,
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.480]   I could lift the card and you could see it,
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.100]   the next card coming, right?
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.100]   So what they do is they have a card on top of it
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:41.220]   that you burn that isn't the card,
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.060]   and then the next card is the one that comes face up.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:48.660]   - I just learned about the edge sorting thing
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:52.080]   that Phil Ivey, maybe others were involved with.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.700]   I just, reading it at first was super interesting to me
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:59.560]   that you can exploit the imperfections
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.180]   in the printing of cards.
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:02.900]   - Yeah. - That was almost cool to me.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:05.900]   That's almost not cheating because it's like--
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.300]   - That needs to be a movie.
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:08.820]   - That needs to be a movie, yes.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.820]   - Yeah, what happened with Phil Ivey in that whole case
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.940]   is it's a catastrophe, really.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:14.860]   It is such a horrible precedent
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:15.820]   'cause here's what he did.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:17.260]   Phil Ivey shows up at the casino, says,
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:18.220]   "I wanna play this game."
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:20.640]   They say, "Okay, all right, I wanna play with those dicks."
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:21.980]   They say, "Okay."
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:24.060]   They agree to everything that he says.
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:25.420]   He never touches the cards.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:28.180]   He doesn't do anything outside of the fact
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:30.380]   that the cards that you supplied
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:32.500]   have imperfections on them and he can see them.
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.540]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.700]   So that increases his chances of winning.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:38.060]   He could still lose, theoretically, right?
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:39.860]   Probably not, but he can lose.
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.820]   In theory, it just gives him a little bit of an edge,
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:44.220]   and it's all stuff based on what you provided.
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.300]   - Yeah. - So the idea
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:48.380]   that you offered a game, I accepted, I beat you,
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.260]   and now you wanna free roll me?
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.700]   That's disgusting.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.860]   - So for people who don't know, maybe you can elaborate,
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.180]   and it's just fascinating to me,
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:57.260]   but you're exploiting the imperfections
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:59.420]   in the card patterns on the back,
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:01.780]   and then they look different if you rotate it.
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:04.180]   And the fascinating thing, too,
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.940]   when you shuffle, usually you don't rotate the cards
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.580]   so that you can see the,
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.460]   sort of detect which cards are the strong cards
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.820]   by marking them through rotating them.
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:19.220]   And the way you know they're rotated
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:21.460]   is because of the pattern imperfections.
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.260]   - Yeah, so some of the cards, like you said,
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:26.020]   like they had that pattern on it,
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:28.420]   and some of them, this was faulty cards on there,
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:29.700]   were not cut properly.
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.860]   So the eights and nines had the card cut differently,
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.580]   and those are important cards in this game,
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:36.780]   the eights and nines or whatever.
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:37.620]   So you could essentially,
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.260]   from looking at the back of the card,
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:41.820]   discern what it's gonna be.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:45.000]   You do nothing in terms of cheating yourself.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:45.840]   You're not rigging the game.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.380]   All you're doing is taking advantage of the fact
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.600]   that you're playing, you've offered me cards
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.300]   that are faulty.
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.180]   - Can I just say that, of course, it would be Phil Ivey,
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:56.780]   who's the goat at the normal game
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:58.860]   who would be figuring out this particular thing.
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.580]   I mean, that's what, if you're into soccer,
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:03.860]   this Diego Maradona has that famous hand of God
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:07.200]   in the World Cup, where he scores a goal with his hand.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.100]   And so of course, the referee didn't see it,
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.340]   they thought it was a header.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:14.340]   So I mean, part of the magic of the genius
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.540]   of the people at the top of the game
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:20.540]   is they're able to exploit all the flaws that are there.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.420]   - That's a beautiful thing to say.
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:24.260]   - Well, see, Phil had, in his heyday,
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:28.300]   he had, he exploited weaknesses in casinos,
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.020]   systems all over the country.
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.020]   Like in one night, I don't know if you know this story,
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:35.620]   in one night, he would take a plane, a private plane,
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:38.740]   and fly to 30 different casinos all over the country.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:40.180]   'Cause he would have these deals where they're like,
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:41.740]   all right, we've got this big, rich sucker
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:43.100]   who's gonna come here and play craps
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:44.240]   and he's gonna lose all our money.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.020]   So he'd have this deal with one of the casinos
[01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:47.580]   where they'd be like, all right,
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:50.560]   you get 20% back up to half a million, right?
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.500]   So if you lose half a million, we'll give you back 100K.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.220]   So he'd go to one casino in Tunica,
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:56:00.980]   he'd play half a million, win, win or lose, he would leave.
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:02.440]   They think they're gonna get him to stay,
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.040]   they get him a big room, whatever.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.900]   So let's say he goes to Tunica, he loses half a million.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:08.820]   Now he goes, he flies to Atlantic City,
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:10.220]   he wins half a million.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.580]   He lost half a million and won half a million,
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:14.220]   but he got 100,000 back.
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.480]   So he's actually plus 100,000.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.940]   Do that at 10 casinos a night,
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.900]   you're making a million dollars in free equity.
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.500]   And they would give him promotional chips
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:22.660]   and all these kinds of things
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:24.200]   and free flights and stuff like that.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:26.260]   So he took advantage of the image
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:27.260]   that they're trying to exploit.
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:29.700]   So this is why I don't have any empathy for these casinos
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:31.460]   'cause they're giving you free drinks,
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:33.180]   they're giving you, why do you think they're doing that?
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:34.660]   Kind of the kindness of their heart?
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:36.140]   They're trying to exploit you.
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:37.020]   So guess what?
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.600]   You lost at your own game, pay the piper.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.060]   And I think it was crazy 'cause the judges in his case said,
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:47.420]   he did not cheat, but wow, it's probably not right.
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:49.860]   Hold on, you just said he didn't cheat.
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:52.500]   You know, that should be the end of the case.
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.580]   And then the casinos do the funny thing.
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:56.220]   I mentioned to you, I was just at the UFC
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.980]   and Dana White is a huge gambler.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:01.540]   He's a blackjack gambler.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:04.300]   And there's that famous situation
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:05.820]   where he got kicked out of a casino
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.020]   and the casinos do that kind of thing
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:08.500]   when you win too much.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.940]   So he won some ridiculous amount of money.
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:15.020]   He bets like, I mean, he plays like millions of dollars
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:16.620]   on hands of blackjack, it's insane.
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:19.460]   And so he won really big and he got kicked out.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.500]   Was he counting?
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.660]   No, no, he wasn't counting.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.680]   So counting in blackjack here in Las Vegas
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:25.460]   is like the only game where they actually
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:26.860]   can ask you not to play.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:28.900]   So like basically if you're counting cards, right?
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.420]   You could potentially have an edge in blackjack
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.940]   and there are some professionals who do that,
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:33.500]   but they get caught pretty quickly.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:34.740]   And then they say, you can play craps,
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.580]   you can play whatever you want,
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:36.820]   but you can't play blackjack here anymore.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.980]   No, I don't think Dana White is counting.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:40.260]   I think he was winning a lot.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.660]   I guess they can claim that they believe you're counting
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.060]   'cause how do you really know if you're counting?
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:47.140]   Well, they easily, they figure it out.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.260]   So basically they have an eye in the sky and they can see.
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.020]   So if you're varying your bet size, right?
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.820]   So there are certain spots where based on the cards
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:54.620]   that are out, let's say for example,
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:57.660]   a lot of the twos, threes, and fours, and fives
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:58.660]   have been coming out.
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:01.720]   So the deck is rich in face cards.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:03.580]   That's very good for the player, right?
[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:06.860]   So imagine you were betting 500 bucks
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:09.980]   and then all of a sudden you up your bet to 2000 or 5000
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:11.080]   when the deck is rich.
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.940]   They know when the deck is rich in high cards
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:14.740]   'cause they keep a counter themselves.
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:17.300]   So if they notice a player increasing their bet sizes
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:20.260]   when the deck is good for them, it's a telltale sign.
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:21.100]   - Interesting.
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:22.660]   I don't think Daniel White would be counting.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.420]   It's so, casinos don't kick you out
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.180]   if you don't often kick you out.
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:28.780]   Do they ever kick you out if you make too much money?
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:30.660]   'Cause you're playing millions of dollars that they--
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:32.300]   - Unless they, they would never kick you out
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:34.340]   for making too much money unless they suspect cheating
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:35.280]   'cause why would they?
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.240]   They have an advantage.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:37.500]   They want the money back.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.660]   It's not like you go in there and win 10 million.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:40.100]   You're like, oh no, that's enough for us.
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:42.020]   - What about if he was talking shit the whole time?
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:42.860]   I wonder.
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:44.460]   - I don't think that would matter.
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.500]   You know? - 'Cause in the long run,
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:48.100]   they'll get the money back.
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:48.940]   - Exactly.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:49.780]   - Yeah.
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:55.660]   You tweeted, if you watch "Jersey Shore" family vacation,
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:57.460]   we would probably get along really well.
[01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:59.940]   What is it about, 'cause I had lived in Jersey for a while,
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:03.420]   what is it about "Jersey Shore" characters that you love?
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.600]   - I just love that they're sort of, I love the debauchery.
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.940]   I think Pauly D's a fun guy, you know?
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:12.280]   And just like, it's just something like, it's just,
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.600]   it's, what do you call it?
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.700]   It's trash TV, it's a guilty pleasure.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.580]   But you can just watch Snooki get drunk
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:19.540]   and falling all over herself or whatever.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.220]   - So is that part, do you love that part of Vegas as well?
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.060]   - Eh, not really.
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.300]   Like, I don't go out and stuff.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:27.060]   But I kinda, I just like the characters.
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:30.100]   I like that they have, you know, unique personalities.
[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:32.460]   And I think like, we live in a world now
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:36.580]   where people are more and more careful of what they say
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:38.500]   and afraid of backlash and all that stuff.
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:41.100]   And it's kind of like an old school version
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:42.620]   of just like, say what you feel.
[01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.940]   It's okay, as long as your intent is good.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:49.460]   And, you know, like, they haven't been canceled,
[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:50.900]   if you will, which is good.
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:53.460]   But I feel like their type of behavior,
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:54.740]   slowly but surely, like,
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.140]   'cause they got a lot of flack originally
[01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:59.860]   for misrepresenting like, Italian Americans
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:00.700]   or something like that.
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:02.060]   Like, there was a lot of backlash about,
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:03.940]   this isn't how Italian Americans really are
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:05.020]   and blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:08.780]   So they sort of were representing that group of people.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:12.100]   And, you know, they received some backlash back in the day.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.820]   - I'm a huge supporter of diversity
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:19.140]   in all the beautiful forms that the human species
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.020]   is able to generate.
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:22.060]   And that's certainly one dimension.
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:25.220]   What's the greatest Vegas movie, would you say?
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:26.500]   I don't know if that's a difficult question.
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.340]   - Not really.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:29.060]   - "Fear of Loathing Las Vegas," "Leaving Las Vegas."
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:29.900]   - "Casino," baby.
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:30.740]   - "Casino."
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:32.580]   - I watch, 'cause anytime "Casino" is on randomly,
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:33.740]   I always watch it.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:34.980]   - Such a great movie.
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:38.060]   It could be one of the, Sharon Stone.
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:38.980]   - Sharon Stone.
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:41.340]   Frankly, Sharon Stone reminded me,
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:42.340]   every time I would watch the movie,
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.540]   it reminded me of my wife, Amanda.
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:45.620]   Like, totally.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.380]   I would see the character, and I was like,
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:49.860]   I'm the Robert De Niro character in the film.
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:52.940]   I used to watch it through that lens, you know?
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:57.340]   - From the depth of love that you have?
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:00.020]   - Just kind of, she was, I remember that she was like,
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:01.900]   she was like, she lit up every room.
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:03.580]   She does light up every room when she goes there.
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.620]   Everybody's attracted and drawn to her.
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:07.220]   And she was kind of, when she was younger,
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:09.260]   she was a little wild and crazy and whatnot.
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:11.660]   So she reminded me of the Sharon Stone character.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.940]   And then the Robert De Niro character's trying to like,
[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:16.060]   have a stable life, you know, and be that.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:16.900]   Now that was me.
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:19.060]   - Who was the Joe Pesci in your life?
[02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:19.900]   - Well, there was a guy named,
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:22.540]   there was a James Woods, for sure, who was the Lester.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:24.820]   We called him, we actually called him Lester.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.620]   A few of my friends call him Lester.
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:28.980]   You know, the greasy guy,
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:31.420]   who tried to get back in and all that.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.260]   But yeah.
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:33.100]   - Yeah, one of my favorite scenes
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.300]   is when they meet out in the desert,
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:36.660]   and it's like a 50/50 odds
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:38.420]   if you're gonna make it out alive in that.
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:40.860]   I mean, yeah, there's an epicness
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:43.420]   to that portrayal of Vegas.
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:45.420]   - I love, I mean, it's just totally,
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.780]   I mean, it's obviously more corporate now,
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:49.460]   and it's different, but I love those movies.
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.460]   I love all those movies, just seeing that life.
[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:53.140]   And like I said, if there was a period in time
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.380]   that I could go back to and just experience it,
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:56.780]   it would be that, you know, right around then.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:58.060]   - There'll be that.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:00.220]   We're playing with a mob.
[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:02.000]   - I think of like these crime shows today,
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.040]   like they're so unrealistic now,
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.660]   because if they're in an era that is now,
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:08.260]   like none of this stuff can happen,
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:09.700]   'cause there's cameras everywhere.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:11.060]   You can't like get away with these,
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:13.680]   like killing somebody and jumping in a car,
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.860]   and you're gonna get caught, you know?
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:18.260]   But in the '70s, you know, that stuff happened.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.620]   - You cross the line, you die.
[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:20.460]   - Yeah, Lake Mead.
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:22.860]   Lake Mead is recently like losing water,
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:24.300]   and like every couple days,
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.780]   they're finding more and more bodies from that era.
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:28.380]   - Oh, no. - They really are.
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:30.860]   - You're close with your mom.
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:33.340]   What did you learn about life from your mom?
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:35.060]   - My mother was very generous.
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:39.220]   My mother, she experienced joy through giving people.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:42.100]   Food, for the most part, my dad would get them drinks,
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:45.580]   and that was how she felt fulfilled, right?
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:47.460]   She felt good when she like would cook for you,
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.380]   and like she'd be that person, you'd come over,
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:50.740]   and she'd be like, "Are you hungry?"
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.940]   And you'd say, "No, no, no, I'm okay."
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:54.740]   She's gonna put 15 things in front of you, and you'll eat.
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:55.580]   You know, you're gonna eat,
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:56.820]   'cause everyone does that, to be polite.
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:57.780]   "No, no, I'm good."
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:59.540]   But you know, they will start to eat.
[02:02:59.540 --> 02:03:01.500]   And just her hospitality in that regard,
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.500]   and just being generous,
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:05.980]   and like being a good host to people, and things like that.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.960]   - How did that define, like help define
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.080]   who you are as a person, that generosity?
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:14.560]   - Yeah. - Did it rub off on you?
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.480]   - It made me think about, in my life,
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.560]   when it comes to like any sort of business deals,
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.960]   or things like that, I don't wanna get the best of it
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.640]   in such a way where I screw the other person.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:26.960]   I genuinely don't.
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:29.440]   I'd much rather you owe me, than me owe you.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.120]   So if I hire people,
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.180]   they get paid more than they're supposed to.
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:36.080]   And I'd rather them do that, and work towards it,
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.240]   rather than feel underpaid.
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:39.480]   'Cause if they're underpaid, they'll likely under deliver.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.200]   Whereas if they feel overpaid,
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:43.320]   then if I need them to do something special,
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.280]   they're not gonna be like, "Hey, I don't get paid for that."
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.760]   It's like, yeah, you do.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.600]   You really do.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.900]   So that's certainly like played out in my life,
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:53.120]   where I set it up in such a way, where I don't owe.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.680]   You know, I'm owed.
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.120]   But that's okay.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.640]   'Cause I can handle taking the worst of it in spots.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.880]   I don't like being the person to, you know,
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.360]   feel like I'm indebted to others.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.600]   - Yeah, and in some way, the karma of that
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:10.200]   tends to pay dividends in the longterm, somehow.
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:15.120]   Somehow there's somebody up there
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.600]   that's keeping track in some kind of way.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:20.480]   What advice would you give to young people today,
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:22.280]   in high school and college?
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.240]   How to have a career they can be proud of,
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.340]   or maybe how to have a life in general
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:28.940]   they can be proud of?
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:32.120]   - I would say like, your 20s is a good opportunity
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.920]   to set yourself up for the rest of your life, right?
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:38.200]   So while the 20s are a period where you wanna have fun,
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.440]   and you wanna experience youth,
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.400]   it's also a good opportunity to start thinking about,
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.840]   what do you want your life to look like
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.840]   in your 30s and your 40s, right?
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.660]   So I feel like it's the best time
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:51.200]   to really put yourself out there and take risks,
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.760]   and try to hit it, you know, whatever,
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:55.360]   you know, like to work really, really hard
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.400]   to set yourself up.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:59.880]   Because, and I said this at a event I was speaking at,
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:01.040]   when you're like, with poker,
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.480]   when your bankroll is very, very small,
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.280]   it's replenishable, right?
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.960]   You don't need to protect it as much
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:09.360]   as you do once you've got something, right?
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.200]   Once you have a brand, or you have money,
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:12.560]   you have something like that,
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.040]   that's when you wanna start protecting.
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.560]   But in your 20s is an opportunity
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:17.680]   to just really sort of get a cut,
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:19.760]   get, you know, to work really, really hard
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.060]   to set yourself up, you know, for the future.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:23.280]   I am concerned a little bit,
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.600]   like every time I talk to kids today,
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:26.080]   I'm like, what do you wanna be?
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:27.880]   They all wanna be YouTubers,
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.640]   or Instagram stars, or rappers, right?
[02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:32.480]   Like, okay, I was like, that's cool,
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:34.280]   but like, there's only so many of those,
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:35.360]   you know, that there can be.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.520]   So it might be worthwhile having
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:38.040]   a little bit of a backup plan.
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.880]   - I think it's easier to be successful
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:43.220]   on Instagram and social media if you do something else.
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:44.720]   And-- - I would say this too.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:47.000]   One other thing I would say is,
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.680]   don't choose a profession or an idea
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:54.040]   because you think it'll make you rich, right?
[02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.580]   Pursue something that you actually love.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:57.760]   Because if you love it,
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:59.600]   you're way more likely to become rich.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.320]   If you don't, you do something
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.000]   that you don't actually enjoy,
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.480]   now you're spending a lot of your life unhappy,
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:06.720]   doing something you don't want,
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.800]   and if you're not passionate about it,
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:09.800]   you're probably not,
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:12.280]   the chances of you being successful are much lower.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.040]   - And also becoming rich,
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.800]   and I've talked to a lot of rich people,
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:17.440]   hang out with a lot of rich people,
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:21.480]   is not going to be as fulfilling as you imagine
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:23.280]   if you arrive there by not doing
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.760]   the thing that you love doing.
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:25.640]   - That's true. - Ultimately,
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:28.180]   the thing that you love doing is,
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.360]   like, that's what makes life worth it.
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.320]   - There's another quote,
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.280]   I can't remember who it was,
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:33.120]   otherwise I would quote them,
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.020]   but it says something to the effect of,
[02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:39.720]   if we believe in the lie that more is always better,
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:41.680]   then we can never truly arrive.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.520]   Because wherever we are, more is better, right?
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.720]   I've never understood,
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:46.760]   and I've been around rich people,
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:50.880]   like you said, I never got, I don't get it.
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.000]   If you have a billion dollars,
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.720]   why do you give a shit about money at all?
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.720]   Like, and they're still like, oh, we made this deal,
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:59.680]   and I'm like, we picked up 300, who cares?
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.200]   Your life is set.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.120]   There is that bell curve, right?
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.320]   Where obviously being in poverty,
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.400]   there's obviously a high rate of unhappiness,
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:10.040]   but there's a certain amount of money where you reach,
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.040]   where you reach a level of happiness,
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.360]   and then too much, you find that people
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.480]   that are searching for money to fulfill these holes,
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.580]   it starts to go back down again.
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:21.600]   - Well, the getting more money could become a game,
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.600]   like a sport, that's fun to play,
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.400]   as long as you directly or indirectly acknowledge
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:29.600]   that what you love is the game of it.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.120]   Versus the actual attainment of money.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.680]   - And I think that's what it is, right?
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:34.680]   For me, I've never cared about money that much.
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.520]   I just never did.
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.360]   Otherwise I would have a lot more of it.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.120]   But it's always been strange to me
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:42.240]   how people that have that kind of money
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:45.260]   like are cheap in any way.
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:47.240]   You know, like they wouldn't donate 5,000
[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:48.960]   to a worthwhile charity.
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:50.640]   'Cause it's like, buddy, this,
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.440]   like when it changes your life,
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.520]   not, and even like small things like taxes.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.480]   Like, okay, you have $20 billion,
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:00.680]   and you're worried about paying 33%, 30% of 31.
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:03.520]   I get it, I get the point of it all,
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.920]   but like it literally has no effect on your life whatsoever.
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:10.280]   Your life is unchanged, whether it's 31 or 33.
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.920]   - Yeah, that's the negative of a lot of money
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:14.880]   is if it corrupts the way you see the world,
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:16.580]   you start to be protective and so on.
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:19.320]   I mean, part of the challenge of when you get a lot of money
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:21.240]   is people start to treat you differently.
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:24.840]   And so navigating that correctly is very challenging.
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:25.940]   So don't change.
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:29.980]   Remain the same person you always were.
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:32.060]   'Cause if you change, you start to,
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:33.740]   I mean, that's why power corrupts
[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:36.020]   is you get a lot of power, you get a lot of fame,
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:37.860]   you get a lot of money.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:40.180]   You start to distrust people.
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:41.900]   You start to push away people
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:43.300]   that are actually really close to you.
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:45.460]   - And you also, I think you develop some biases
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:47.100]   where you think like you're just this,
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.420]   you know, you think like it was all you,
[02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:51.060]   and you're a genius, and you're so great,
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.460]   and all these other people who don't have,
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:54.080]   it's just 'cause they don't have what you have.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:55.180]   And like, you just,
[02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:57.080]   then you start to like view that group of people,
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:00.280]   whether they're impoverished or whatever, as like less than,
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.680]   and that you're some like great guru
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.080]   where you could have just got lucky and bought Bitcoins
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:05.500]   that you could have done anything,
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.500]   and then you became like super wealthy.
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:10.140]   And then you have this like Dunning-Kruger effect
[02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:11.800]   where you think you know everything about everything.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.000]   And a lot of poker people have that.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.780]   And I, listen, I'm probably guilty in some ways too,
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:17.600]   you know, thinking because you can figure out poker
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:20.180]   and be great at that, that you could figure out anything.
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:21.440]   So there's like, it's true, right?
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.160]   I mean, we sort of, we genuinely feel like,
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:25.640]   people that reach the highest levels of poker
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:27.200]   feel like they are intelligent.
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:28.440]   So they will look at problem solving
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:30.120]   and think that they have answers.
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.200]   - Well, you have to remind yourself that you're not.
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:33.040]   - Yeah.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:35.480]   - It's best to see the world as you did just get lucky,
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:37.080]   or at least from my perspective,
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.400]   that you're not better than anybody.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:39.240]   - Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:40.720]   with like acknowledging that you worked hard
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:41.980]   to get where you were.
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.520]   Like there isn't, but at the same time,
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:46.140]   like it's not available to everybody in the same way.
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:47.440]   You know, right time, right place.
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:48.600]   Like for me, my poker career
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:50.500]   could have gone very differently, you know?
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:52.320]   If things didn't work out, you know,
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.400]   if I had some bad luck in the wrong times,
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:56.080]   like who knows where I'd be.
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.840]   - So you said your brain curl is pretty small in your 20s.
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.800]   I'm sure you've been around a lot of people
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:04.720]   you care a lot about who've lost everything in poker.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:05.960]   What's that like?
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:09.280]   What's those low points of losing everything?
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:12.040]   - I think because I've been there,
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.600]   I have more empathy than I probably should for those people.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:16.480]   I really feel for them.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:18.960]   'Cause I remember being in Vegas and being totally broke.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.720]   And like a guy loaning me $400
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:24.260]   and me like turning that 400 into 20,000,
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:27.340]   400 bucks and it was like eternally grateful of that.
[02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:29.540]   So when I have friends who go through that,
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:32.220]   like I always try to consult them obviously,
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:34.660]   but they really need his money for the most part.
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.420]   But I remember saying no to one friend
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:37.700]   because he didn't have a plan.
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:39.820]   So I like to try to help them in that regard.
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:42.220]   Like my buddy's like, can you stake me in this game?
[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:43.860]   And I was like, all right, well, how much do you?
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:45.740]   Then I was like, let's break down the math, bro.
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:46.580]   You want me to stake you?
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:48.740]   So you get 50% of the profit, right?
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.440]   So I said, how much do you think you can make in this game?
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:52.160]   How much does the biggest winners make?
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.640]   He's like, well, I can probably,
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.280]   I probably do like 20,000 a month in this game.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.120]   So, okay.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.960]   So you get half of that 'cause I get 10, right?
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.920]   What is your monthly net?
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:00.760]   How much are you spending?
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.400]   He's like, well, I'm renting this thing for 8,000.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:05.920]   You're spending 17,000 a month.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.480]   So like no matter what you're set up to fail.
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.900]   Like this isn't gonna work.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:12.160]   So I actually didn't give him the money.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:13.920]   And I was like, what you need to do to earn more money
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.240]   is lower your monthly net.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.080]   'Cause it's too high.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:19.140]   It just, you know, it doesn't mathematically add up.
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:21.460]   So trying to set them right in that regard
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:24.660]   is something that like I feel obliged to do,
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.500]   especially if they're friends.
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:27.540]   - But what about the mental aspect of the struggle
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:28.380]   they're going through?
[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.980]   The struggle you were going through?
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:34.380]   Just, I mean, it's really rough to have no money.
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:35.500]   - It's not for everybody.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:36.320]   This really isn't.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:37.700]   Like a lot of people might, you know, listen to this
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:38.780]   and think like, oh, I wanna play poker.
[02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:40.540]   It's like most people fail.
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:43.860]   Most people who wanna play in the NFL,
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:46.280]   they spend their college years,
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:48.480]   like most of them are not gonna make it.
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.400]   Most of you who try to play poker professionally
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:52.880]   are going to fail and you're gonna experience despair.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.760]   Okay?
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.120]   There are those like in anything that have the passion,
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:57.320]   have the know-how, have the luck
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:59.640]   and all that sort of stuff and it all pans out.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:01.600]   But you know, they're the minority.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.440]   - And so for the low points, if you remember,
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.700]   what does it take to sort of overcome that,
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:12.240]   overcome the mental struggle?
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:13.760]   I mean, you're making it sound like certain people
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.540]   are just genetically able to in certain--
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:17.380]   - I do think some people are more apt
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:19.260]   to being able to deal with like adversity
[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:21.580]   and having resilience and some people just can't hack it.
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:23.340]   But like I generally what I would advise,
[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:24.740]   you know, people that are, let's say a guy's playing,
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:26.440]   you know, really high stakes or whatever,
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.500]   you're doing badly is step number one
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:30.500]   is take a little bit of a break here.
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:33.740]   Let's recalibrate and let's start small again.
[02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:34.980]   Let's, you know, let's restart
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.100]   and let's play smaller stakes
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.660]   and let's get our confidence back
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:39.960]   because in poker, without confidence,
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.620]   you cannot be successful.
[02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:44.760]   It is incredibly important to have almost an inflated
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.840]   level of confidence in yourself
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.760]   because you're up against it, right?
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.420]   As I said, the majority of people fail.
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:51.480]   So why are you special?
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:52.520]   Why are you different?
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.480]   You have to be pretty confident about your, you know,
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.520]   yourself to think that you are one of the chosen ones.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.640]   - And then don't resist the despair and take a nap.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.000]   - Definitely take a nap.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.040]   And listen, it's okay to experience it.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:06.760]   Like I said, yeah, you're gonna experience this.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:09.240]   What else would you, what should you be feeling?
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:10.360]   You know, if things are going poorly
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:11.440]   and you just lost all your money.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.840]   Excited?
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:15.900]   Maybe like, okay, have your moment of grief.
[02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:17.100]   Allow yourself to experience it
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:20.540]   so that you can, you know, reassemble.
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:21.780]   - There's a fundamental way
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:23.740]   in which you haven't really lived life
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:27.200]   if you haven't experienced periods of despair.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.060]   - You have a jaded view of the world, right?
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:31.880]   - Weird thing about the human condition
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.300]   that both the highs and the lows are important.
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:36.140]   - Yeah.
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:40.780]   - What role does love play in the human condition?
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:42.280]   - Daniel Negreanu.
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:43.680]   - That's a good one.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.060]   - What role has love played in your life?
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:48.740]   - It's, yeah, that's, you know,
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:51.020]   you sort of talked about the ups and downs
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:56.020]   of the human condition and love has been that for me, right?
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:58.560]   (both laughing)
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.560]   Like I'm in a good place now,
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:03.380]   but you know, even with my now wife,
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:06.700]   years ago, you know, she was young.
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:07.940]   She was, you know, new to poker
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:09.280]   and she wasn't ready to settle down.
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:10.380]   I was like, when I met her,
[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:12.500]   I think I was 31, she was 21.
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:15.060]   And I was ready to like lock her up, if you will,
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:16.460]   you know, let's do this.
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:17.860]   And I bought a ring way back when,
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:19.220]   she was like not about that.
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:21.000]   She was living the Hollywood life.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.340]   She was living, you know, partying in LA,
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:23.940]   doing that kind of stuff and wasn't ready.
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.260]   And we split and that one hit me hard.
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:31.160]   So I didn't realize how much of a hit
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.260]   that had on my confidence in my, in everything really,
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:36.640]   in poker, with other women.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:39.320]   It had me a little jaded about women too,
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:42.100]   you know, resentful, you know.
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.340]   And it took a lot of like self-retro,
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:45.820]   I did like a lot of personal growth work
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:47.620]   and workshops and things like that.
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:49.900]   And then didn't see her for years.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:51.820]   And she came back to town, I was a much different person.
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:53.140]   It was just, you know, four years ago
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:54.180]   or something like that.
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:55.540]   And she was too.
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:58.780]   Went to dinner, a few months later, we were married.
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.500]   It worked out so different 'cause we both had to grow,
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.060]   you know, and become different people.
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:05.540]   - Huh, and that love was still there somehow.
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:07.580]   - Yeah, like she went through her relationships.
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:08.580]   I went through mine.
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:09.960]   You know, we experienced life.
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:12.920]   And I was married once before too, you know,
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.920]   called my starter marriage, if you will.
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:19.040]   Which, yeah, you know, we just, you don't know.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.200]   I think like until you do it, until you get married
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.600]   and, you know, experience like the sacrifice,
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.800]   not necessarily the sacrifices, but your value systems.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.080]   If they don't align identically,
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.160]   which they're not going to.
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:31.800]   Someone like me, one of, probably one of my,
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:32.860]   one of my strengths in poker,
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.120]   but my weaknesses in relationship is judgment, right?
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:37.920]   When I play poker, I need to judge you.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.340]   It's essentially what I'm doing.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:42.020]   I'm gauging who you are and what you're good at
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:43.140]   and what you're bad at.
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:45.180]   And that can have repercussions 'cause it leads,
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:46.500]   that's how I, you know,
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.620]   that's the lens I look at everyone with
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:49.680]   based on how you live your life.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:50.520]   I'm judging you.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.020]   This guy's this, this guy's that, this guy's that.
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:53.300]   And that's not healthy.
[02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:56.140]   - So you have to shut that off in personal relationships.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:56.980]   - You have to learn to like, and the thing,
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:59.500]   I finally realized what love is, frankly, for me,
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:02.100]   with her is no judgment, right?
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:02.940]   - Yeah, acceptance.
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:04.900]   - So like, yeah, so I have my way of being, right?
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.940]   If she wants to have cereal for dinner,
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:08.560]   maybe that's the best decision for her.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.280]   I was living in a framework of better and worse.
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.940]   The way that I do things is better and yours is worse.
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:15.840]   Do things more like I do.
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.400]   That's the recipe for disaster.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.840]   True acceptance and true love is accepting someone
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:21.440]   like exactly as they are.
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.200]   You know, if she wants to do something different,
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:25.040]   I'm gonna support her, whatever it is.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:26.640]   Even if I disagree with it personally
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.560]   and like the way that I would do things,
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.400]   learning to just realize that she's had a different journey
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:34.280]   and a different walk towards where she's at than I have.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.500]   So I can't pass my judgments on other people like that.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:39.340]   - I believe it is ethically wrong
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:42.020]   and probably illegal to eat cereal for dinner.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:45.660]   - Listen, if she wants it, she wants it.
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:46.820]   - Acceptance.
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:47.900]   - Like when she goes to bed,
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:50.060]   like all these little things about my regimented life.
[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:50.900]   She's not.
[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:53.620]   Like our motto at our wedding was like,
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:56.700]   "You keep me wild, I'll keep you safe, you keep me wild."
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:16:59.020]   I keep her safe, she keeps me wild.
[02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:01.460]   She's like not organized and anal and all those
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:02.940]   kind of things, I am.
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:06.160]   She helps me like let loose.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.560]   You know, "Oh no, I'm eating this, this."
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.920]   She's like, "Have some popcorn."
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.040]   I'm like, "All right, let's do it."
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:12.560]   You know, she keeps me freed.
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:14.800]   - And accepting that, embracing that,
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.720]   the difference is the chaos of it.
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:18.560]   - Yeah.
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:19.380]   - That's what makes it--
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:21.080]   - Like I literally do think about with her
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.380]   how important it is and how much I try to like
[02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:28.240]   just come from neutral and like compassion and never judge.
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.400]   'Cause she's got other things that she deals with, right?
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:31.240]   That I don't.
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:32.920]   She's bipolar, right?
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:35.840]   So with that, I've studied and I've learned a lot about
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.860]   you know, sort of mental health and what that means
[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:42.860]   and ways in which a lot of characteristics about somebody
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:46.660]   is completely out of their control when they're bipolar.
[02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:47.500]   Right?
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:51.260]   And there's swings, like there's no cocktail
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:53.820]   for bipolar that solves the issue, right?
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:56.540]   So there's medications that work to level you out
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:58.700]   for periods of time, but then they start to fade
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:17:59.560]   and they don't work as well.
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.540]   So they constantly need readjustment.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:04.020]   It's an unsolved mystery to a certain degree.
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:08.420]   So in some sense, you know, her diagnosis
[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:11.180]   made our relationship easier
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:13.540]   because I don't take anything personal, right?
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:16.040]   I realize that sometimes she's gonna be in a mood.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.060]   And so, you know, I mean,
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:19.780]   she's so good about communicating it though.
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:21.500]   She tells me, some morning she'll be like,
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:23.100]   "Bad mood, trying to get out of it, babe."
[02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:24.020]   I'm like, "Okay."
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:24.860]   I leave her alone.
[02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:25.700]   - Well, that's great.
[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:27.620]   That means she's grown to be able to communicate,
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:29.980]   to understand, to self-reflect, to understand where she is.
[02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.940]   I have people in my life who I love who are bipolar.
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:34.080]   It's a beautiful ride.
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:35.140]   - It is, right?
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.700]   Yeah, it's, yeah.
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.820]   The highs and the lows are there.
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:41.580]   So, but yeah, like, because I feel like a protector.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:44.420]   For me, I just wanna be a rock, right?
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:45.940]   And that's part of the whole cereal thing.
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:47.820]   If she wants to eat cereal,
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:50.580]   don't make a rung for anything she wants to do.
[02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:52.140]   - What have you learned from life
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:55.700]   from the song "The Gambler" by Kenny Rogers?
[02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:58.740]   You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:01.580]   know when to walk away, know when to run.
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:02.780]   You never count your money
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:04.140]   when you're sitting at the table.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:05.620]   There'll be plenty of time for counting
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:06.860]   when the dealing's done.
[02:19:06.860 --> 02:19:08.940]   Is that, do you live by those words?
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.860]   - The first part of it, for sure.
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:12.020]   - What do they even mean?
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:12.860]   'Cause--
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:15.380]   ♪ You got to know when to hold ♪
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.620]   So basically, it's like, all right, in life,
[02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:21.620]   like, let's use a, whatever, the market, for example.
[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:23.140]   You bought a stock, right?
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:24.340]   Or you bought Bitcoin, and you're like,
[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.380]   it's gonna go to the moon, right?
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:29.580]   It's like, okay, well, maybe things have changed.
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:32.500]   New scenario, new circumstances, new situation.
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:34.820]   Are you going down with the ship, right?
[02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:36.100]   Or are you gonna lay the hand down?
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.100]   Are you gonna fold it?
[02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.780]   Whether it's a relationship, you know?
[02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:41.180]   You're with this woman, you're like, all right,
[02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.060]   I think it's time to fold this one.
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:45.500]   I think, you know, I don't think that we're gonna be able
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:47.740]   to make this hand work right now.
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:49.780]   - When to fold 'em and when to run.
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:51.700]   - Yeah, when to run. - So maybe,
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:54.180]   every gambler knows that the secret to surviving
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:55.500]   is knowing what to throw away
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:56.860]   and knowing what to keep,
[02:19:56.860 --> 02:19:59.740]   'cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.
[02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:01.180]   That's like a stoic philosophy.
[02:20:01.180 --> 02:20:04.980]   And the best thing you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:09.300]   Every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.
[02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:10.420]   What does that mean?
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:11.260]   - I like that one.
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:13.060]   I like, for me, that's like the difference
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:14.420]   between victim and responsible,
[02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:16.180]   like the way that I think about it, right?
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:18.180]   You can be a victim to circumstance,
[02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:20.460]   or you can be responsible for everything in your life, right?
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:23.620]   So when an event happens, the event itself
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:27.460]   is neither good or bad until you assign it value, right?
[02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:30.820]   So like an event happens and can be traumatic,
[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:33.860]   it can be painful, but how you respond to it
[02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:35.580]   is ultimately gonna be up to you.
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.820]   Like you actually do have a choice.
[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:39.000]   - And that's the thing you can control.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.140]   The fact that you, Daniel Negreanu,
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:44.020]   took my commentary about the gambler seriously
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.300]   shows once more that you're a beautiful human being.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:47.140]   (laughing)
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:49.380]   Thank you so much for being who you are,
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:51.780]   for inspiring millions of people about poker,
[02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:53.100]   about how to live life.
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:55.420]   And thank you for giving me your valuable time today.
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:56.260]   This is amazing.
[02:20:56.260 --> 02:20:57.080]   Thank you for talking. - It was fun, man.
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.860]   It was great to have the conversation.
[02:20:58.860 --> 02:21:01.260]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:02.420]   with Daniel Negreanu.
[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:03.540]   To support this podcast,

[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:13.540]   "Poker is war.
[02:21:13.540 --> 02:21:16.500]   "People pretend it is a game."
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:19.300]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:21.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.460]   (upbeat music)
