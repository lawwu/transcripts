[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, a 22-year-old new college graduate writes in asking for
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.780]   advice on how she can set up a plan for financial independence.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.940]   Keelan writes in and says, "I'm a 22-year-old recent college graduate.
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.180]   I've since landed a job and have been working for about four months now.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.660]   Here's my current situation.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.980]   I live at home with my parents, rent-free.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.420]   I am extremely fortunate to have no debt from college.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.340]   In fact, I have no debt at all.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.540]   I work a full-time job and save virtually all of that money.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.700]   I work a part-time job and use that money as my spending money.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.460]   Essentially, I am blessed to have a blank slate coming out of college.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.940]   The downside of my equation is that my full-time job does not pay particularly well, perhaps
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.020]   about $31,000 a year, and I live in an area with a high cost of living, northern Virginia.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.620]   Do you have any advice for someone like me who is just getting started in the real world
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.980]   and wants to begin a path to financial independence?"
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.660]   I do realize that a huge step would be to find a better paying job.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.820]   I'm working on that.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.900]   However, what would you suggest that I do in the meantime to add additional income and
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.660]   begin my journey to financial independence?
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.460]   My goal is not to make this all about making more money, but rather to position myself
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.300]   in such a way that I can live the life the way that I want.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.100]   Also, I want to be in a position where I can easily provide advice and assistance to those
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.980]   who are less well-off than I am.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.060]   Thanks in advance for any advice that you can provide.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.060]   Keelan.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.460]   Well, Keelan, let's start with the fact that you are in a position already to provide advice
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.140]   and assistance to those who are less well-off, which is probably about 98, 95 plus percent
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.340]   of the world's population.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.180]   And I want you to approach your life recognizing that.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.980]   You are in a remarkable situation and you've done a remarkable job of establishing yourself
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.500]   for a very bright future.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.100]   So let's talk about some ideas and suggestions that I think will help you.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.300]   First we need to begin with financial independence.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.580]   I'll give you some ideas about how to integrate goals for financial independence with other
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.580]   life goals.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.260]   And then I'll give you some at the end of the show, some specific suggestions for steps
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.060]   that you can take to move you toward financial independence.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.620]   First, why do you want to be financially independent?
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.620]   It's a big question and many people jump into it without actually thinking about it.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.500]   Why do you want to be financially independent?
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.380]   What is it about the concept of financial independence that you find attractive?
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.660]   What are you working for?
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.580]   Why do you want to be financially independent?
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.900]   You say right here, my goal is not to make this all about making more money.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.500]   Well, if the goal is not about making more money, that's pretty much what financial independence
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   means.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   It means making and accumulating more money.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.860]   So if it's not all about making and accumulating more money, then why do you want to be financially
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.900]   independent?
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.460]   My guess is if you spend some time thinking about this, there will be a few things that
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.380]   come to your mind.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.400]   One reason would be a sense of control, a sense of autonomy, a sense of personal direction
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.900]   and personal freedom.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.440]   Another aspect would be the meaning of your day-to-day existence, the ability to do things
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.180]   that you think are important because you think they're important.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.220]   These are the common themes of why people want to be financially independent.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.300]   So it's important to recognize that financial independence is not going to make you happy.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.940]   Financial independence is not really going to do much to change your life unless you're
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.960]   doing something before financial independence that you don't want to be doing and you're
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.240]   trying to work towards something after financial independence that you do.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.500]   In which case, why wait for financial independence to do that?
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.900]   How is financial independence and the quality of your life, how do these things work together?
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.320]   How are they integrated?
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.420]   So first let's talk about what you can do that's outside of financial independence and
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.100]   then I'll give you some specific steps that will move you toward financial independence.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.540]   But let's put this in the right order because you don't need to be financially independent
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.900]   to be happy.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.840]   You don't need to have a million dollars in the bank to be able to do what you want.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.100]   In fact, there are some very simple steps that you can make that will start to build
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:47.740]   a life that will give you these things while you also work on higher pay, saving money,
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.700]   becoming rich, etc.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.380]   Number one, the biggest thing that will determine your level of happiness is the quality of
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.500]   the relationships in your life.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.460]   These are also at a young age some of the most important decisions that you'll make.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.780]   The first obvious example is the relationship with your immediate family, you're living
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.940]   with your parents.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:17.300]   The quality of that relationship will have a big impact on the quality of your life.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.720]   So give time and attention to it.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.380]   The biggest relationship that will chart the course for the happiness that you experience
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.620]   in life and for your freedom and for your independence is who you choose to marry, your
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.460]   marriage relationship.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:42.180]   The person that you choose to marry will make a bigger impact on your happiness than almost
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.420]   any other factor in your life.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.500]   So before you start thinking about money, you should spend a significant amount of time
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.780]   thinking about how will you meet and marry the husband of your dreams.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.460]   Married people are richer than non-married people and married people are happier than
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.860]   non-married people.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.420]   So you should be spending time thinking about how to become happily married.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.920]   There are two things that you have to consider in order to be able to do this.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.540]   The first most important thing is to become the kind of person that would attract the
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.380]   type of man that you'll marry.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:33.120]   That's the fundamental way that you'll be able to attract to yourself an appropriate
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.160]   husband who will enhance your happiness.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.720]   You have to become the kind of person that will attract the type of man that you want
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.600]   to marry and then you have to be in the types of places that that man would be so that you
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   can meet.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   Now most people don't start giving financial advice by giving marriage advice and that's
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.980]   where I think most of financial advice is pretty wrong headed.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.360]   If you have done like I did and you've worked in the context of financial planning, you'll
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:08.120]   quickly realize that money is often not at the core of many problems.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.660]   Relationship problems are often at the core of life problems.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:20.120]   And so don't start with focusing on money, start by focusing on quality relationships.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.960]   If you want to set out a plan for financial independence, make sure that you don't run
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.600]   past the importance of relationships too quickly.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.960]   One thing that should be obvious for you is if you are going to become the kind of person
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.120]   that would attract the type of man that you would want to marry, if you're going to do
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.780]   it, you have to be able to identify the type of man that you would want to marry.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.320]   And so you should spend time thinking about that now.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.400]   You should spend time making a list of the character qualities and the attributes of
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   that person that are important to you.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.480]   That's an important place to start.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.160]   Unfortunately the way that most people, especially most 22-year-olds, approach this problem is
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.280]   completely wrong headed.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.480]   They don't give any time to it.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   They don't give any thought to it.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.920]   They approach their life and say, "Well, I'll just fall in love at some point in time."
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.720]   What they do is they experience an intense feeling of emotional attraction to another
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.600]   person, but there's no underlying substance to the relationship.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   There's no thought.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.280]   There's no planning.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.220]   And yes, in every sociological study I've ever seen, married people are happier than
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.520]   unmarried people, but common life experience would indicate that there are a lot of people
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.320]   who are unhappily married.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:50.240]   And so the way that you avoid being unhappily married is, one way, is by being very clear
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.320]   on the type of person that you would like to be married to.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:02.520]   That will then drive you to say, "What type of person do I need to be in order to be attractive
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.320]   to the type of person that I want to be married to?"
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.520]   Much more important than saving money, much more important than putting money in a Roth
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.440]   IRA, and much more valuable to your financial independence.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.320]   Now you ask the question, "I'm 22 years old.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.080]   Should I do this now or should I do this later?"
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.920]   The answer is you should do it now.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   Don't get married too soon, but when you find the person that you want to marry, marry right
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.800]   away.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.160]   You definitely don't want to run into a relationship that will affect the rest of your life very
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.680]   quickly, without forethought, without planning, without consideration.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.800]   But on the flip side, there's no reason to defer for many years down the road.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.560]   Especially there's no financial reason to defer for many years down the road.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.680]   Married people are much better off financially for many reasons.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   They earn more money and they have more money, but just the simplest obvious reason is they
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.240]   can pool their talents and their resources and their incomes and their expenses can go
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   down.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   It's cheaper.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.200]   It's not double to put two people together in a household.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.360]   And so you have measurably better economic potential as a married couple than you do
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.180]   as an individual.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.080]   So you want to make sure that you're prepared for that.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.960]   So ask yourself how you can build and develop and maintain quality relationships, starting
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.000]   first with your family members that are nearby already, and then also thinking very carefully
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.640]   about how you will meet and marry the husband of your dreams.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:47.040]   Number two, you should carefully and intentionally choose your geography.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.560]   Before you think about saving money, choose where you're going to live.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.600]   Before you think about becoming financially independent, choose where you want to be.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:07.680]   Because your decisions surrounding geography will drive the lifestyle that you live.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.980]   If you want to be in a big city, go to a big city now.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.040]   If you want to be in a country, in the country, consider going to the country now.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.720]   If you want to be in the mountains, go to the mountains now.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.120]   If you want to go to the ocean, go to the ocean now.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.700]   This is the time in which it will be cheaper and easier and simpler for you to establish
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.520]   yourself in a geographic location than ever it will be in the future.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.840]   So carefully consider your geography.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.480]   This will have to do with your career, which we'll talk about in a moment.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.060]   It'll also have to do with simple things like the tax system under which you live, the economic
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.960]   future of the location that you're in.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.440]   And it will relate heavily to thing number one, who are you going to marry and how are
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.980]   you going to meet them?
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.920]   If you marry and meet and marry somebody in the town that you're in now and you want to
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.480]   be in a different town, that could very quickly bring in a source of stress.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.960]   If you want to live in a different town, you might consider going to a different town before
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.240]   establishing your social circle.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.320]   Choose the geography that you're going to live in and design it around the lifestyle
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   that you want.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:22.540]   If you know anything that's important to you in the lifestyle that you desire to live,
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:32.820]   choose it now and move there because the place that you live will make a big impact on your
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.400]   life.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.580]   Design it now and go intentionally.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:48.420]   First career choice, your careful choosing, selection and design of an appropriate career
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.500]   will make a huge impact on your level of happiness.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.980]   I don't know which of these three things is more important than another.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:03.100]   I don't know if your career makes a bigger difference in your level of happiness and
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.420]   your level of satisfaction than does the person that you're married to.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.100]   I don't know if your geography makes a bigger difference than your career.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.100]   I really don't.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.800]   I just know that all three of these are very important factors.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.520]   If I were to rank them, I would say that probably the number one most important thing is the
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.020]   quality of your relationship, especially your marriage relationship.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.820]   Number two is the appropriateness of your career for yourself and number three would
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.160]   be geography.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.140]   That would be my guess on the ordering.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.540]   But I think that you should choose geography in some ways before you choose career because
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:44.180]   there are many careers that you can do in certain types of geography that are related.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.420]   But if you choose a career first and then you try to choose geography, that career may
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.280]   or may not transfer over.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.540]   So consider your career choice.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.660]   Here you should spend time very carefully reviewing your skills, your talents.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.260]   Look at what your college degree is in.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.540]   Consider if that is something that you want to continue working in.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.860]   Look at your areas of interest.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:12.380]   Do some personality profiles, etc. and carefully design a career choice that you think will
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.540]   be helpful for you, that will be appropriate to you in the long term based upon the lifestyle
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.900]   that you desire to live.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.380]   Now when you're doing this, think about a few things.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.960]   Think about the economic future of the geography that you've chosen.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.340]   Some places are in decline.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.700]   It doesn't mean you can't live a great life there.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:38.100]   It just means that you might not choose a local place, a local career, a career that
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.900]   is tied to geography.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.460]   I personally would be very happy to live in a place that had a declining economy because
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.020]   my income can be earned from a place that doesn't have a declining economy.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.020]   And so I could get a very great value on my money by earning money from a place where
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.100]   there's lots of people to send it to me and spending it in a place where my dollars go
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.700]   farther I can set up a really nice arbitrage situation for myself.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.820]   On the flip side, if you're in a location that has a growing economy, look at the local
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.480]   economic trends and try to understand how those will impact your potential career choices.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.300]   There's not just one career choice that's appropriate for you.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.420]   Rather, you have skills, talents, and abilities that could be translated and applied to various
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.340]   careers and various applications.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.540]   So think carefully and study carefully your career choice.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:33.980]   Think carefully and study carefully how your career choice will integrate with your future,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.260]   with your future plans, with your future goals, with your future dreams.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.980]   Think carefully about how the work that you've chosen to do will integrate into your future
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.980]   family life.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:54.220]   Don't spend time building a career that you'll want to leave or change in the future if you
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.940]   could take that time building a career that you won't want to leave or change in the future
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.840]   as your family circumstances change.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.000]   So think carefully and design your career.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.360]   Those are some of the most important things that you can do to really build a life that
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.740]   will develop a system of independence, that will build a life that will be happy, that
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.340]   will build a life that will give you the feelings of financial independence and will cause everything
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.980]   else to flow from there.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.020]   If you're in a career that's well-suited for you, it won't be hard for you to be really
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.140]   good at it, which means that your income will automatically go up.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:39.340]   And because your income is automatically going up, you can save a lot more money and become
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.820]   financially independent much more quickly.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.860]   If you've chosen your husband very, very carefully and you've figured out what values and attributes
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:53.180]   are important to you and you meet somebody at the local investment club or in the local
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:59.260]   real estate club or in the local business club versus at the local bar or at the local
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.900]   place that attracts people who are not forward-thinking, the local, I don't know, video game hangout
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.800]   or whatever the version of that is in your local area, you're much more likely to meet
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.740]   somebody who will share your financial goals.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.100]   And now when you come together, instead of looking at things and fighting against each
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.700]   other, you'll be able to build a future together.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.620]   So do you see how these things are integrated?
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:30.360]   You can't approach financial problems and just say, "What's the one, two, three?
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   How much money should I save?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.380]   How much money should I put in my 401k?"
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.200]   These are secondary questions.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:42.020]   They're not primary, but those things I laid out for you are primary.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.040]   Here are some financial things to consider.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:52.640]   You are in a phenomenal position of being a college graduate who is debt-free.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.760]   Here's a suggestion for you.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:03.480]   Commit yourself to never borrowing money, any time, for any reason.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.720]   Here's why you might consider that.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:11.040]   If you commit yourself to never borrowing money at any time for any reason, you will
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.720]   be able to have freedom and independence for the rest of your life, no matter the situation
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.420]   that you're in.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.600]   Is this guaranteed to be the most optimal financial outcome?
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.520]   No, I don't think it is.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:34.560]   I think you can make a compelling financial case that sometimes borrowing money will lead
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.880]   potentially to your being wealthier.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:48.400]   But would this type of commitment lead to your being more financially independent?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.720]   Here I think you can make a very strong case that by making this personal commitment to
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:01.440]   never borrow money, any time, for any reason, you always have your liberty.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.680]   You can always walk away.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.700]   You haven't mortgaged your future to pay for your present.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.480]   And if you're interested in liberty and financial independence, I think this is a personal financial
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.560]   commitment that would go far for you.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.080]   Here's another simple commitment that would lead to financial independence.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.520]   Never spend more than half your income.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.820]   Make sure that you never spend more than half your income.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:37.880]   And maintain that commitment until you are financially independent.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:43.160]   I think that a good target number for you to shoot for is to always make sure that 50%
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:50.800]   of your income is invested for your financial independence.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.460]   You will have expenditures that you will want to make during this phase of your life.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.640]   And you need to be careful not to try to live too frugally.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:06.000]   Now, of course, I recognize that and I honor you for working a full-time job, saving all
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.900]   that money, working an extra part-time job for your spending.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:17.720]   But this time of your life is not only something that should be spent on work, work, work all
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.880]   the time.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.360]   These are experiences that will be very valuable for you to accumulate during this time of
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.520]   your life.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.600]   And so how can you figure out how to set a budget towards those things?
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.800]   Well, I think it makes a lot of sense to just simply make sure that you never spend more
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.280]   than half your income.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.400]   If you want to set a different number because you have different goals, if you want to say,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.080]   "I want to spend 30% of my income or 70% of my income," that's fine.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   I just like half.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.620]   It's simple and it's effective.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.020]   And here's the key.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.640]   You should save.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.560]   50% is what goes for long-term financial independence.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:21:01.520]   You can still save money out of the lower 50%, but that money could be spent on experiences
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.640]   if you want to have them.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:09.120]   22 years old is a great time to set aside money and consider traveling if that's something
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.360]   that you're interested in.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.260]   Consider investing into a hobby or skills that are valuable for you.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:22.080]   You have a huge amount of personal freedom and autonomy at this stage of life.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.340]   And it's important to make sure that you maximize that.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.720]   Don't live a deferred life.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.680]   Plan for the future and live in the present.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.920]   You don't know if you have tomorrow, so live in today while also recognizing that it's
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.720]   valuable to plan to save for tomorrow.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.780]   There are a lot of things that you can do during this phase of your life that will go
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:51.240]   with you for the rest of your life and you'll be very happy with them.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.840]   Don't make the mistake of putting everything on tomorrow.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.760]   Also don't make the mistake of spending everything today.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.420]   There's a balance.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:09.220]   And I think a really great way to approach that is always set aside 50% of your income
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.740]   for financial independence until you're financially independent.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.340]   Spending less than 50%?
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.940]   You might choose to save, you might choose to spend.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.940]   That's up to you.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.220]   But I think that's a really good way to approach it and a really useful balance.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.780]   What tactically can you do?
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:34.620]   First, before you participate in anything such as investing in your 401k at work or
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:41.300]   going on any fun trips or anything, I recommend to you that you work really hard to set aside
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:46.300]   $10,000 in savings before you do anything else just as a good round number.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.980]   There's no magic to this figure.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.860]   It's just a good round number that I think buys you a substantial amount of freedom.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:57.340]   And I would love to see everybody have $10,000 sitting in a savings account before they moved
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.500]   on to any kind of investing whatsoever.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.420]   Tactically after that, if your employer retirement accounts give you an employer match, go ahead
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   and consider signing up for that and at least take advantage of the match.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:17.260]   And then focus on setting aside something like $100,000 in savings.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:24.300]   Now how you allocate this money and how you divvy it up, that's up to you.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.700]   Is this all going to go for your long-term financial independence?
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.140]   Well, how much of it came from the 50%?
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.640]   You got to decide that.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.900]   But I think it's really valuable for young people as quickly as possible to get their
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:43.520]   hand on at least several tens of thousands of dollars and $100,000 is a great round number.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.660]   During this phase of your life, it's very possible, very probable that if your life
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:54.320]   will look anything like many of your peers, you will be in a situation to where you'll
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:59.020]   have many expenses that you'd like to make at an early age.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.120]   You might find yourself wanting to buy a reliable car.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.280]   You might find yourself wanting to make sure that you save for have a nice wedding if that's
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   important to you.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.320]   Go on a nice honeymoon with your husband.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:19.520]   Set up a life that will establish you in the type of lifestyle that you want to live in.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.200]   And money is very valuable in these early years.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.420]   Liquid money, not money that gets wasted, not money that gets spent, but liquid money.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.880]   And it will give you, if you can save several tens of thousands of dollars, hopefully as
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:38.040]   much as $100,000 in a non-retirement account, that will give you the ability to follow your
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.700]   dreams no matter what they are.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.420]   I have yet to find anybody who can prove me wrong in this or who's brought evidence that's
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.000]   convinced me I'm wrong.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.600]   When I look at almost every situation where somebody's stuck, when I look at every situation
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:01.800]   when somebody's unhappy and their finances are contributing to that, I can't find a situation
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:10.160]   that would not be solved by keeping $100,000 in the bank.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.440]   I really can't.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:19.720]   And when you recognize that the true benefit that you're trying to get is this sense of
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:25.640]   independence, not the money, it's what the money buys for you.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.040]   It's the lifestyle, it's the effect.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.360]   Money just helps you get there, it's the cause.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.840]   I think this is well worth considering in terms of some simple financial steps.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.440]   After that point in time, you would need more specifics to figure out your plan.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.080]   You would need to figure out, are you tuned in an entrepreneurial bent?
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.500]   Is your career high-powered and worth pursuing further?
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.440]   Is there a particular type of investment that's well-suited for you?
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.000]   From there, you need to get much more personal.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.280]   I can't answer it in the context of an email like this.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:10.240]   But if you go through these things, I think that you will have a good foundation for financial
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   independence.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.480]   I hope you see the tension that I'm trying to bring here between life decisions and financial
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.240]   decisions.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.080]   Start with life decisions.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:31.240]   As I said in review, number one, biggest impact, relationships.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.960]   Good relationships with your family that you live with now and a great relationship with
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.120]   a potential husband.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.600]   Give serious time and consideration to how you're going to arrange those circumstances.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.260]   Number two is geography.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.260]   Number three is career choice.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.080]   If you establish those three things well, you almost don't need the money and the money
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.000]   will flow.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.240]   Financially, never borrow money at any time for any reason and you'll maintain your independence
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.000]   throughout your lifetime.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.020]   Always save half your income for financial independence until you become financially
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.160]   independent.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.400]   And any kind of spending and saving that you want to do, make it on the other half.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.920]   Consider setting aside cash first, 10 grand in the bank, move on to fund employer retirement
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.560]   accounts, etc. with the goal of getting to $100,000 as quickly as possible to buy you
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   freedom, no matter the life circumstance that comes at you.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.120]   Don't forget to take care of basic insurance.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.260]   As a young single woman, you should make sure that you have good comprehensive disability
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.780]   income insurance to protect your income, which next to your health is your most valuable
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.780]   asset that you have.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.600]   And I would encourage you, continue taking advantage of the situation that you're in
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   with your family.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   If you have good family relationships, enjoy the situation, enjoy those years with your
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.240]   parents until or unless you decide to move out.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.840]   Take advantage of the financial savings and contribute to their household.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.880]   Here's my thoughts on living with parents.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:13.080]   There is this massive social stigma against living with parents.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.520]   I think it's horrible.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.900]   I really do.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.760]   Now young men and women should be responsible.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:28.840]   And there's a big difference between being a mooch and consuming everything from your
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:35.400]   parents and not contributing to the household versus being a responsible member of the household.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   I don't get the sense.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.920]   You're obviously not a mooch.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.160]   But your parents' great joy is to contribute to your life and to help you.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.040]   So if that means that staying there, if they allow you to live there rent free, as long
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.560]   as you're saving and you're not squandering all of your money, that's good for your character.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.500]   The most important lesson if your parents were writing me an email that I would be telling
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.280]   them is to say, "Make sure that your son or daughter is responsible, that they're not
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.400]   squandering all their money."
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.760]   Well in this situation, you're not.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.840]   You're saving.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.040]   And so your parents can look at that and recognize that you have the character that's necessary.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.840]   Now take advantage of those family relationships.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.200]   Enjoy that time.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:19.080]   This can be a very special time in your relationship with your parents where you can really build
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.720]   deep and enjoy those relationships.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.900]   It won't always be this way.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.560]   So take advantage of it.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.040]   I'm convinced people who live with other people, I don't have any sociological data for this
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.340]   like I do for other claims, but I'm personally persuaded that people who live with other
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.660]   people are generally happier just because most of us get lonely if we live by ourself.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.440]   Who wants to live in an empty apartment by yourself just so that you can impress the
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.940]   world that look at me?
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.300]   This is silly.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.460]   I'd much rather live with my parents, period.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.460]   I'd much rather do that.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.900]   As long as I'm not being a mooch and a leech.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.380]   That's the important thing.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.380]   So I make that distinction.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.940]   I encourage you, save your money, continue living with them and build those family relationships
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:03.940]   there and enjoy.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.940]   Until or unless there's something compelling that takes you beyond that, I think that's
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.780]   well worth considering.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:20.240]   And make sure that you use this time period to invest in some of the intellectual pursuits,
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:27.260]   some of the recreational pursuits, some of the deep things that will be more difficult
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.280]   later as life gets more gets complicated.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.760]   If you I don't know what your college degree was in, but I didn't spend as much time in
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.820]   college reading the types of books I wish I'd read.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.420]   Take the time now to work on your personal ideology.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.800]   Think about your political philosophy.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.460]   Think carefully about it.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.740]   Think about your religious ideology.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.740]   Think carefully about it.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.420]   Consider what you believe and why so that you can be well grounded.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.980]   That's another thing that leads to happiness.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.900]   Religious people are happier than non-religious people.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:08.620]   So consider what you believe and why.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.620]   And those are pursuits that are hard to do at later phases of life.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:19.020]   But if you really take advantage of this period of time, you can live some amazing adventures
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.820]   while also really building up and working toward financial independence.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:30.060]   Final practical thought, I would be cautious about working an extra job at this point in
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.180]   time if that extra job is costing you the time that could be put into something that'll
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.780]   have bigger long-range benefit for you.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.580]   You don't need the extra money from an extra job.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:49.260]   I would work a 40-hour job for someone else, and I would invest the other time into personal
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:55.740]   skills, personal hobbies, personal intellectual pursuits, personal business.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:01.640]   I think you'd have a much higher rate of return than just working trading hours for dollars.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.260]   So I hope these suggestions are useful for you, Kylie.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.700]   You've got an amazing future.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:12.020]   And I think any parent listening would be proud to have you as a 22-year-old woman starting
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.820]   your life on this foundation.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.540]   I hope these thoughts are useful as you pursue financial independence.
