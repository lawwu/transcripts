[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Several good follow-up questions
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   on your cremation article.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480]   Nikki writes in, "Hello Pastor John,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.420]   "I read your article,
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.820]   "Should Christians cremate their loved ones with interest?
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.740]   "My mom, a Christian, has made it known
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.660]   "that she wants her body to be donated to research
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.500]   "after her death since, quote,
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.240]   "she won't need it anymore," end quote.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.200]   And Laura in St. Paul, Minnesota writes in,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.800]   "Pastor John, thank you for your recent article
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.320]   "on cremation versus burial and the dignity
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.660]   "of the human body.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.960]   "Having trained in biology and medicine,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.100]   "I can attest to the necessity of having human cadavers
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.100]   "available for training.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.580]   "What insights would you provide someone
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.140]   "who is considering donating their body to science,
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.020]   "such as an anatomy bequest program?
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440]   "Also, if the dignity of the human body
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.780]   "could be a reason against donating one's body to science,
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.520]   "wouldn't this also be a reason
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.820]   "to not be an organ and tissue donor as well?"
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.720]   What would you say to Nikki and Laura?
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.500]   - Well, it's an incredibly good question,
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.440]   an important question, and a front burner question,
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.660]   because I just did a funeral a few weeks ago
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.260]   for one of my favorite people in all the world,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.200]   and I didn't know at all what she had planned,
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.820]   and the body wasn't there,
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.740]   and I talked to her closest friends.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.580]   She's in her 80s, and she said
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.720]   she'd given it to the university.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.760]   So this is relevant and close.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.360]   The reason that the intrinsic dignity
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.040]   of the human body, rooted in creation by God
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280]   and destiny for resurrection,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   is morally significant in my article about cremation
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.400]   is that the choice is between burning the body
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.160]   and burying the body.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.320]   That's the choice I was dealing with.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.560]   That was the issue,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.000]   and I think it's an important issue,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.740]   but I don't want to raise its importance
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.980]   higher than we should.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.920]   Burning bodies does not have a biblical association
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.800]   that we want to call to mind when a loved one has died.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.040]   That's one of my big concerns.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.520]   And burying has healing and redemptive associations,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.880]   such as the sowing of a seed
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.000]   that will sprout and come to glorious flower
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.880]   at the resurrection.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.040]   So there's beautiful and negative associations
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.280]   that commend burying over burning.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.920]   Now, the question is,
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.480]   does the donation of a body for use in medical research
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   or teaching of medicine bring into play
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   new moral factors that I didn't deal with in that article?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.680]   And the answer is yes.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.720]   And the first difference is that in donating one's body
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.580]   to the study or the practice of medicine,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.580]   the intention is not to simply burn the body to ashes.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.440]   As in cremation,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.980]   the cremation is simply a means of disposing of a body.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.400]   That's what cremation is.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.320]   It disposes of a body.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.160]   That's not the aim in the donation of the body.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.880]   It may be that certain parts of the body
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.200]   are in the end burned by the scientific community.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.020]   I don't know.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.800]   I haven't done the research,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.960]   and I don't know the answer to what happens to cadavers
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.600]   when their usefulness is complete,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.840]   but even if they are disposed of in that way,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.080]   which I would, by the way, discourage
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.760]   if I were involved in that kind of thing
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.040]   in the scientific community,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.480]   the aim in giving the body
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.640]   is not that that happens,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.240]   not that the body be burned.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.120]   That's the first big difference.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   The second difference is that the aim
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.000]   in donating the body to medical science
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   is precisely to honor the preciousness of the body.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.440]   Now, there's this kind of irony here, I know,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.000]   that we all understand.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.560]   Giving yourself to one seeming indignity,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.680]   which I think dissection in front of a lot of people
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.280]   is a kind of seeming indignity,
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   serves paradoxically to elevate the dignity
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.040]   of what you have just given to indignity.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.400]   Now, consider a couple of analogies,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.280]   the analogy of a organ donation.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.600]   When you allow yourself to be cut open
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   and an organ, kidney, say, taken out of your body,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.040]   this is highly unnatural,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.480]   and in some cultures and situations
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.400]   would be viewed as a kind of disemboweling torture, yuck.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.260]   But your motive is to donate your kidney
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.480]   to your sister to save the life of her body,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.720]   and that changes everything about the way you view
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.200]   the cutting of your own body
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.640]   and the gutting of an organ from your bowels.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.440]   So the same thing is true of subjecting a dead body
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.360]   to the indignities of dissection.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.200]   One could imagine, it's easy to imagine,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.480]   it has always been viewed this way by and large in history,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.600]   that one could imagine such indignities
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.520]   being debased and disgusting and evil,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.400]   some sinister motivation to dig up a body and carve on it,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.040]   yuck, that could be viewed that way.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   But when one considers that the aim is the discovery
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.560]   or the improvement of some healing procedure for the body
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.120]   or training of doctors in the healing arts for the body,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   then those very so-called indignities to the body
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.140]   take on a kind of beauty
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.200]   that in fact serves the dignity of the body.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.240]   And here's the other analogy I was talking about.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   This one moves me most deeply.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.280]   One could even think of the analogy
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.400]   of Christ's body at this point.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.240]   Surely the human body that Christ took on
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   was not designed to be tortured and whipped and lacerated
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.000]   and speared and nailed to a cross like a piece of meat.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   But all of those indignities were embraced by Christ.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.120]   He chose them.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.200]   He submitted himself to them.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.080]   He gave himself to them,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.580]   not only that our souls might be saved,
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.380]   but precisely so that our bodies
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.480]   would be raised from the dead
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.880]   and all the indignities of disease and death and torture
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   would be overcome precisely because he gave his body to them.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.400]   So I would not, here's the conclusion,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   I would not put donation motivated in these ways
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.040]   in the same category with cremation,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.480]   which leads me to one last, for me, pressing question,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.760]   which Nikki didn't ask, but I must.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.600]   Well then, should all of us donate our bodies
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.560]   to medical science?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.080]   And my short answer is no.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.980]   And here's my thinking.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.640]   There are many family issues
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.760]   that need to be taken into account among others.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.960]   For example, are there young children involved
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.080]   who just lost a mommy or a daddy
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.400]   who need to process the death of a parent differently
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.280]   than thinking they're being carved up at the university?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.120]   A grave to visit may be very, very important.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.480]   I think the principle that might guide us would be this.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.480]   Is there such a manifest shortage of cadavers
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.400]   that the promised good that comes from their use
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.880]   is seriously in jeopardy because of my refusal to donate?
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.800]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.720]   The closer, here's the principle,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.440]   the closer the connection between the greatness of the need
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   in medicine, say, and the immediacy of my decision
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.080]   to give or not to give, the closer that connection,
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.740]   the greater the obligation to give.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.680]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.600]   And for that article on cremation,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   you can find it at Zaringod.org.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.900]   It's titled, "Should Christians Cremate Their Loved Ones?"
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.560]   A modest proposal published on April 26th.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   I can imagine this episode here
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.040]   raises stem cell research questions,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.760]   but that will have to wait until later
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.360]   because tomorrow we talk about weddings,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.680]   simple weddings, joyful weddings,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.700]   and why we need young people with backbone
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.280]   and radical Christian courage in order to show
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.960]   what truth and beauty and joy can look like
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.680]   in an inexpensive wedding.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.800]   The joyful, simple wedding, that's tomorrow.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.960]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.100]   with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
