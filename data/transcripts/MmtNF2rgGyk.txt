[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:14.200]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 4, reading from verse 29 to 33. We are still
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.400]   considering this incident recorded here at the end of this fourth chapter of the Book
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.080]   of the Acts of the Apostles, in which we are given an account of the members of the early
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.680]   church meeting together in prayer to God. What led to that, you will most of you remember,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.040]   was the fact that Peter and John had healed the men who had been born lame, the men they
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.400]   used to carry every day and put in to sit just outside the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.680]   Peter and John, seeing this men and given the commission, were enabled to heal the men.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.120]   Turning upon him they said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.680]   In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." The men who had never walked
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.080]   in his life stood up. Peter just offered him his right hand and the men stood up. His feet
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.080]   and ankle bones gained strength immediately and in a few moments he is to be seen walking
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.180]   and leaping and praising God and going into the temple. Well, as I have been explaining,
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.440]   you can read the history for yourselves. Those of you who do not attend here regularly, you
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.560]   will find that this led to a great commotion. In the end it led to this, that Peter and
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.560]   John were arrested and brought before the great court, the Sanhedrin, meeting in Jerusalem.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   They were examined and cross-examined about this deed that had been done in this way to
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.000]   these impotent men. Peter gave the reply that they had not done it, but that the Christ
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.080]   whom they had rejected had done it, that he was still alive and he had sent the Holy Ghost
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.280]   and this is how he was manifesting his presence and his power. Well, the council is perplexed,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.160]   does not know what to do, cannot bring any charge really against these men and yet they
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.320]   do not want this to go on. So they straightly threatened them and charged them that they
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   should stop preaching and teaching in the name of this Jesus. Peter replies saying,
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.080]   "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   ye, for we cannot but speak of the things which we have seen and heard." However, they
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.320]   are dismissed. And there they are, Peter and John, outside the courtroom and they decide
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.840]   to go back immediately to the church and they reported what had happened. And we are told
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.720]   that when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.840]   and they began to pray. And there follows the prayer which we have been considering
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   in detail. And here we have, I say, the end of the prayer and the answer to the prayer
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.520]   and the results of the prayer. Now then, why are we doing all this? Well, we are doing
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.120]   it because we are anxious that we should all be quite clear in our minds as to what Christianity
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.880]   is. This is our object. And the only way to find out what Christianity really is, is to
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.240]   come back to this book called the New Testament, which is our only authority on this subject.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.120]   We know nothing apart from this. It all began here. Here's the account of how it began.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.720]   And everything has come out of this. Now we are concerned to do this because it is the
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.040]   only hope in the world tonight. There's no other. There's nothing else that can give
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.200]   anybody any hope whatsoever, in a personal sense or in a general sense. I don't care
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.400]   whether you come primarily tonight because of some personal problem, or whether you're
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.360]   concerned about the whole world, man, his future, what it's all about. I say there
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.720]   is no answer but this. It is literally the truth. It is the only answer. That is the
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   case, of course, because it's not some human speculation, but it is the revelation of God
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.600]   and what God says about all these problems that perplex us. Very well. It's our only
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.000]   hope. Well that makes it doubly important, doesn't it? That we should be quite sure
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.600]   and certain as to what it is. If this is the only hope, well what is it? And here we find
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.960]   this appalling, tragic confusion, which is true, alas, not only of the world outside
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.720]   in its ideas as to what is Christian, but unfortunately in the Christian Church herself.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.880]   And therefore I say we must come back to this. What have we found? Well what we've found
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.960]   is this. There are certain things that are absolutes, certain things that are essential,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.680]   certain things that are basic. We've been looking at them. What are they? Well, the
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.240]   truth concerning God the Father. "Lord, thou art God," that's where they start,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.160]   "who has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is." The great biblical
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.280]   teaching about God the Father, and then the Son, and then the Holy Ghost. This is the
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:26.000]   teaching. These three blessed persons in the blessed Holy Trinity. This is the message,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.680]   the action of these three in connection with the great plan and purpose of salvation.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.560]   You see, the people assembled at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, these people rarely
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.100]   said the whole thing themselves, you know. When looking at these apostles who had recently
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.120]   been baptized with the Spirit and who were speaking in other tongues, they said, "We
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.880]   do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God." That's it. God the Father,
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.680]   God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. And we've been looking at those wonderful works
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.720]   of God. We've been seeing the preparation in the Old Testament and the fulfillment in
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.160]   the New, when the Son of God came on earth and was born as a babe, and what he did and
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.800]   said and how he died and how he was buried and how he rose again, how he ascended, how
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.760]   he sent down the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. The wonderful works of God. Or
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.800]   as Peter puts it in his summary, "We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:46.240]   heard." Now then, we've seen that this is what constitutes Christianity. This is the
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.320]   Christian message, and it is this message that makes Christian people. This is how the
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.800]   church came into being. The church consists of people who believe these things. The church
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   consists of people who have believed the apostolic message and who regard as facts this series
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.560]   of the wonderful works of God, culminating as we saw last Sunday night in the descent
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.360]   of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost upon the church and his subsequent activities
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.680]   in the church. Very well. Now then, here's the question that now remains for us to consider.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:34.640]   How is all that related to us? I say the church consists of people who believe in that. You
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   see we are even given that very expression here. We are told, "The multitude of them
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.560]   that believed were of one heart and of one soul." Now here's the question. What is
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:56.160]   it that has related these wonderful works of God to these individuals? That obviously
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.120]   is the next question we have to ask. You start by seeking what is the content of this great
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.440]   message. But then, how does this message come to men and women? Well now then, here is something
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.200]   again which is shown to us very plainly in this one and selfsame incident. And it is
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.560]   the most important aspect of the whole matter. How does it become related to us? I say the
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:26.080]   answer is that was the very thing about which these people prayed. That's why they prayed
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.360]   at all. They were not praying, as you notice from the very terms of the prayer, they were
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.840]   not praying about themselves. They were not praying that they might be delivered or that
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   these opponents, these authorities might be silenced. No, no. The object of the prayer
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   of the early church, the Christian church at the beginning, was just this one thing.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.080]   You see, Peter and John had been prohibited to preach any more in this name. So had all
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.880]   the others. They had told them to go back and tell all their friends and helpers that
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.000]   they must no longer preach, nor teach, nor do anything in the name of this Jesus. Now
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.040]   that's the thing that made them pray. Well why did they pray? Well they prayed for this
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:19.480]   reason. The one thing they wanted to do was to go on preaching and teaching and working
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   in the name of this Jesus. And they realized that there is only one way whereby they can
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.560]   do that. And that is that God should enable them to do it. They know that they can't
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:39.320]   do it. Who are they? There wasn't a well-known name among them? No influence? No authority?
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.240]   No money? No power? Nothing. They were nobodies and they're against the great authorities,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.200]   the Sanhedrin, the Roman power behind it, the philosophers of Greece behind them. What
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.520]   can they do? They're helpless. There's only one thing to do. And that is to turn to God
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.160]   and ask him to enable them to do this thing that they've been prohibited to do. You notice
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.320]   that is their prayer. When they come to the application that's how they put it. "Now
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   Lord behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.760]   may speak thy words, by stretching forth thine hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:29.680]   be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus." That's their request. So you see it is as
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:36.880]   I'm pointing out to you, a request that they may be enabled to tell everybody about these
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:44.120]   things that they'd seen and heard, these wonderful works of God. Very well then you
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.840]   see the only deduction we can draw is this, that it is the special work of the Holy Spirit
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.440]   to enable this to be done. Now last Sunday night we began dealing with this whole doctrine
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:03.760]   of the Holy Spirit as it is taught here, and we looked at it in a more historical sense.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.000]   The objective evidence of the working of the Holy Spirit, we're now looking at it tonight
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   in a little more subjective manner, but it's exactly the same thing. The special work of
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.800]   the Holy Ghost is to enable this message that is prohibited to be proclaimed and preached
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   with holy boldness. How does he do it? Well it's perfectly clear from the record here
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:36.600]   as everywhere else in the New Testament that he does it in two main ways. The first thing
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:43.280]   he does of course is to enable the preacher to preach it. And when I say preacher I don't
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.760]   only mean the men like myself standing in a pulpit like this, I mean any man who tells
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.360]   anybody else about these things. He's preaching when he does so. And you'll find that people
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.920]   did preach like that in the early days and have done so since by talking to one another.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.200]   You'll find in the eighth chapter of this same book of the Acts of the Apostles that
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.680]   there was a great persecution in Jerusalem and all the people were scattered abroad apart
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.400]   from the apostles. This is what I read in verse 4. "Therefore they that were scattered
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.120]   abroad went everywhere preaching the word." And the word used there for preaching is a
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.680]   word which means speaking it. Somebody said that a good translation would be this. "They
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:30.040]   went everywhere gossiping the word, talking the word, explaining it to different persons
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.160]   with whom they came into contact." Now here is one way I say in which the Holy Spirit
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:42.480]   does this great work. He enables one to do that. He gives what is taught, called in the
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:51.800]   New Testament, he gives anointing. He gives clarity of understanding. He gives freedom
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.560]   and clarity of speech. He gives an authority. Now there are many terms that can be used
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.040]   with respect to this. Let me just give you one quotation which seems to me to sum it
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.360]   all up very well. The Apostle Paul writing probably the first letter he ever wrote to
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.440]   a church, namely the first letter of the Church of Thessalonica, he reminds them in the first
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.320]   chapter of the first epistle of how it was the gospel had come to them. He'd been the
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:24.640]   preacher, but this is how he puts it. "Our gospel came unto you not in word only, but
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:32.600]   also in power and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance." Now what he's saying is
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:41.360]   this. He's saying I did the actual speaking, but it wasn't I. I was used. It was in power
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance. In other words, what he means is that as he
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.160]   was speaking, he knew that the Holy Spirit was using him. He was merely the vehicle,
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.680]   the channel, the instrument that the Holy Spirit was using, and he knew that. He was
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.720]   taken up. He was out of himself. He was as it were possessed by the Spirit, and he knew
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.160]   it. He was preaching with much assurance. You see, everything was against him. Thessalonica
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.040]   was a pagan city, part of Macedonia. They hadn't got a Jewish background. They hadn't
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.360]   got the Old Testament scriptures. They didn't know the prophets. They knew nothing. They
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.640]   were living a life of sin and degradation in utter ignorance, and yet the apostle appears
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.520]   amongst them, and he's able to speak with assurance. Why? Oh, because it wasn't in
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:38.840]   word only, but in power and in the Holy Ghost, and with much assurance. You see, Peter says
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.760]   exactly the same thing. These apostles all say the same thing because they all did the
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.360]   same thing, and therefore they must describe it in the same way. Listen to Peter putting
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.640]   it in his first epistle, in the first chapter, likewise. "Of which salvation the prophets
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.440]   have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.760]   you, searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.400]   signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:17.000]   unto whom it was revealed, but not unto themselves, but unto us. They did minister the things
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.360]   which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into." But you
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.960]   see, the point he's making is that the gospel, these things, have been reported to them,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:42.000]   he says, by the Holy Ghost that was sent down from heaven, using the preachers. Now that
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.960]   is what I mean by unction and by power. That's of this good news. The marvelous, wonderful
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.920]   works of God have been made known. The Holy Spirit takes men and he uses them, and he
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:01.080]   gives them this enabling that enables them to speak it in a clear manner. And then, in
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:07.480]   addition to that, as we are reminded here, there are from time to time signs given of
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.600]   this power of the Spirit. They actually pray for it here. They not only ask for boldness
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.560]   that they may speak the word, but they ask that by stretching forth thine hand to heal,
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:27.360]   and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. You see,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.320]   these men, they'd seen our Lord working his miracles. He told them that he'd enabled
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.880]   them to do the same thing, and they'd had the experience of Pentecost. They'd been
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.800]   speaking in tongues, they'd seen miracles, Peter and John had worked a miracle, and they
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.920]   know that this gives authority and authentication. It isn't greater than the power of the word,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.320]   it's an accompanying demonstration. Indeed, in a sense, it's on a lower level, because
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:59.640]   it's visual, and the visual appeals to people very much more, oftentimes, than the purely
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   didactic or that which is more mental, if you like. So, these things did accompany the
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.280]   preaching of the gospel at the beginning. You get the same thing stated in the epistle
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:16.840]   to the Hebrews in the second chapter. Let me read to you verses three and four. "How
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:24.320]   shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:31.880]   Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God also bearing them witness,
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:38.720]   both with signs and wonders and diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.120]   his own will." Now, notice these words. They couldn't do these whenever they wanted.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.420]   It was according to his will. He chose at times to accompany the preaching with these
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:56.040]   visible manifestations. And, as I reminded you hurriedly in passing last Sunday night,
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.320]   if you read the accounts of the great revivals in the Christian church throughout the long
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.840]   history and story, you will find that in times of revival, phenomena do appear and occur.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.640]   As if God were saying in a time of unusual difficulty, "I must now manifest this power
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.760]   in a visible manner as well as in the power of the preaching. But both of them constitute
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   the enabling of the preaching of the message." Now, that's the balance in these matters.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:33.480]   There may be signs, there may not be signs. And the power of the Spirit is as manifest
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:40.040]   in authoritative preaching, converting preaching, such as you get in great revivals, as in the
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:46.560]   most spectacular of miracles. It's the same authority. It is the same Holy Spirit working
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:52.440]   both. Well, now, that's one way in which he does it. But there is another way. And
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:58.480]   that is, of course, his action upon the listeners. You see, the Holy Spirit doesn't only act
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:05.240]   on the preacher. If he only acted on the preacher, nothing would happen. He acts also on the
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.400]   listeners. And that is the thing that's put abundantly before us, especially in the
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.640]   pages of this book of the Acts of the Apostles. For instance, take the supreme example. What
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.840]   happened when Peter was preaching on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem? Here he is, you
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.040]   see, halfway through his sermon. He's just expanding the Scriptures. And we read, "When
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.840]   they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:38.120]   the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?" It's the Holy Ghost who does that.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.960]   It wasn't Peter's sermon. It was a pure exposition of Scripture. But the power, the
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.040]   convicting power of the Holy Ghost was there, working in the listeners. And they're convicted
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.320]   and they cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" And three thousand were dealt
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.440]   with in the same way and were added to the Church. The beginning of chapter 4 tells us
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.920]   that in the next day or so another two thousand were added to them so that they're now number
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.640]   five thousand. Very well. Now then, this is the dual action of the Spirit. He takes the
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:15.400]   preacher, the communicator, the speaker, whether in pulpits or in private, and he gives this
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.640]   enabling. Then he acts upon the ones who are listening, and he deals with them, deals with
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.760]   their minds and hearts and wills. It's a dual action, and they both go on together
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:35.440]   at the same time. Now, here I say is the peculiar function of the Holy Spirit. And what I want
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.160]   to emphasize tonight is this, is the way in which he does this. It's all here before us
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:49.840]   in a most remarkable manner. Let me read it to you again. "Now, Lord, behold their threatenings,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:57.480]   and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word." This is
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.680]   the thing they always put first, "thy word." They ask then for signs, healing, signs and
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:12.400]   wonders. Why? Well, that the word may be confirmed, that the word may be demonstrated. Word, and
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.760]   then Holy Spirit. When they prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.120]   and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. What does that lead to? Here, they speak the
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:32.840]   word of God with boldness. Holy Ghost, word of God, word of God, Holy Ghost, these two.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:39.800]   And my dear friends, these two things must never be separated. And if we ever separate
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   these two, we go astray. There are some people, you see, who put their emphasis only on the
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   word. These are the intellectuals. Ah, they say nothing matters but the word, and they
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.880]   spend their time reading and studying, and they become authorities on theology and on
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:03.960]   doctrine. But their word doesn't affect anybody. It may affect them in making them
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.360]   proud of their own great knowledge. They may get the admiration of others who join with
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.520]   them in doing the same thing. But it's nothing but a little self-admiration, mutual admiration
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.840]   of society. Nobody's influenced, nobody's converted, nobody's convicted. Heads packed
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:25.520]   with knowledge and understanding, useless. Word only, you see. Then there are people
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.800]   who put the whole of their emphasis upon the Holy Spirit. They're not interested, they
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.520]   say, in the word. They say, "It doesn't matter what a man believes. I heard of a man
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:39.040]   recently shouting in a great meeting, 'Let yourselves go! Let yourselves go! Let yourselves
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.080]   go!' And they did let themselves go, I'm told. I wasn't there." But the New Testament
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:51.720]   has never told anybody to let himself go. Never. The Holy Spirit doesn't merely produce
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:59.040]   an experience. The Holy Spirit uses the word. He's a spirit of truth. He's a spirit of
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.840]   enlightenment. He's a spirit that leads to understanding. A man must never let himself
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   go. He must never jettison the intellect and the reason and the brains that God has given
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.480]   him. There's no need for him to do that. The Holy Spirit can deal with his brains as
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.760]   well as any other part of him. It is a false teaching that urges people to let themselves
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:28.800]   go. If you let yourself go, you're letting yourself go to a riot of the imagination and
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.440]   of the feelings. You're letting yourself go to evil spirits and powers that are round
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.640]   and about you and ever ready to possess you and to use you and to fool you. The Spirit
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.600]   and the Word. Thy Word. They speak the Word of God. You see, these things, I say, must
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.560]   never be separated. "With great power, as we saw a few Sundays back, give the apostles
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.960]   witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus." Now then, here you see is the work and the
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:07.840]   function of the Holy Spirit. He takes these facts. We've been looking at them. The wonderful
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.880]   works of God. The things that the apostles have seen and heard. He takes them. And now
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   he presents them. He shows their meaning. He rehearses the facts. He always does that.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:27.600]   A preaching which is not constantly reiterating the facts. The wonderful works of God is not
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.520]   Christian preaching. Christian preaching is not mere exhortation. It's not merely appeal.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.200]   It is the recital of facts. And the Holy Spirit enables a man to do so, to bear witness to
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:46.120]   them. And then he shows their meaning and he shows their significance. That's it. That's
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.240]   what they wanted to do. They said, "We are prohibited to do this. Lord, behold thy threatenings.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:57.120]   Grant unto thy servants power that with all boldness they may speak thy Word." That's
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.240]   what they want. They don't merely ask for signs and miracles. They ask that they may
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.680]   be accompanying in order that the Word may be demonstrated. And the Word is the thing.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:14.520]   And it is always the Word concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is sent to glorify
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.720]   him. Our Lord himself said that. "He shall glorify me." And he always does. You read
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.600]   this book of the Acts of the Apostles, which some people say should be called the book
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.200]   of the Acts of the Holy Spirit. I'm not disposed to follow them. Let them have it. But all
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.880]   I say is this. What does the Holy Spirit do? And the answer is, he always glorifies the
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.800]   Lord Jesus Christ. And he's doing it here. That signs and wonders may be done by the
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:49.880]   name of thy holy child, Jesus. It's always about him. Very well then. How does the Spirit
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   do this? What exactly does he do? I want to suggest to you now that the best exposition
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.320]   you can have of this section of this fourth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:07.240]   is to be found in some words uttered by our Lord as they are recorded in the 16th chapter
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.840]   of the Gospel according to St. John, verses 8 to 11. I'll read them to you. I read them
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.520]   last Sunday night. I'll read them again. He's talking about the Holy Spirit. He says, "And
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:28.480]   when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:35.880]   Of sin, because they believe not on me. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father and
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:44.040]   ye see me no more. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged." Now then,
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.960]   I want to show you the blessed work of the Holy Spirit, how he does it and what he does.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:56.520]   I've got to start therefore with this word "reprove". When he is come, he will reprove
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:03.320]   the world of sin and righteousness and judgment. What's the meaning of this word "reprove"?
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:10.720]   Well, it's generally agreed, and I agree with them in this, that this is not a very
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:18.000]   good translation here in the authorized translation. You will find if you look up the various translations
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.440]   that they vary between two words. About half of them use the word "convict" and the
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.160]   other half use the word "convince". And I want to suggest to you tonight that both
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.800]   are right, and that both together are very much better than the word "reprove". The
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.520]   element of "reprove" comes in, of course, but it's more than that. There is an element
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.120]   of conviction, there is an element of convincing. What's the difference between these two words?
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:52.240]   This is most vital. The Holy Spirit convicts. What is to convict? Well, to convict is to
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:28:06.040]   establish a charge. It is to bring a charge home. But here is an important distinction.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.560]   Take an example of a man in a court, on a criminal charge, a police court or in an assizes,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:21.000]   doesn't matter which. Here's a man on trial, a prisoner in the dock on trial. Now, that
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.640]   man can be convicted, though he may protest his innocence into the end. The fact that
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:35.160]   he is convicted of the crime does not mean that of necessity he admits that he has done
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.760]   it and pleads guilty. The jury can bring in a verdict of "guilty". In other words,
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:47.240]   they have convicted the man of the crime. He is not convinced about this. In fact, he
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:54.200]   violently disagrees with it, perhaps. Nevertheless, it is true to say that this man has been convicted
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:03.240]   by the court, duly constituted, of that particular crime. Convicted. Now, then, this is very
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:13.320]   important, this distinction, because the Holy Spirit always convicts. Always. But he doesn't
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.920]   always convince. I want to show you this very clearly. This is of tremendous importance.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.160]   You see, the fact that the prisoner in that dock doesn't agree with the verdict doesn't
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:32.400]   make the slightest difference. It is the court that convicts him. And he is a convicted prisoner.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.680]   And he is condemned because of that. I want to bring out that aspect. It is important
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:44.960]   for this reason that you will find many instances in this book of the Acts of the Apostles of
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.920]   people convicted without being convinced. I read to you that portion out of the seventh
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.600]   chapter of this book of Acts at the beginning, in order that I might give you just one illustration
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:03.560]   of that very thing. Here is Peter, here is Stephen, the evangelist preaching. And you
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.920]   remember in the application he says, "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:14.760]   ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost." You see, you can't resist the Holy Ghost without
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.040]   feeling something of his convicting power. It is only a man who has felt something of
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.960]   the power of the Spirit who resists the Spirit. If a man feels nothing, he doesn't resist.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.720]   There is nothing to resist as far as he is aware of. But they did. He says, "As your
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:36.920]   fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.480]   have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one," and so on. Then
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.840]   listen, "When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and they gnashed to
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.400]   them with their teeth." What makes them do that? I mean, when you disagree with something,
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.760]   you don't gnash with your teeth, do you? You just say, "I don't agree." You may get a
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.520]   bit heated about it and you may begin to shout, but you don't gnash your teeth. Why not? Because
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.960]   you're not cut to the heart. What cuts to the heart? Oh, the Holy Spirit cuts to the
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.600]   heart. That's the Holy Spirit convicting. That's the Holy Spirit bringing it home, and
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.000]   they hated it and disliked it. They're cut to the heart and they gnash with their teeth
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.080]   and they murder Stephen. That's a case of conviction without there being a convincement,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   if you like.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.800]   And let me give you just one other. The famous case at the end of chapter 24 of this same
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:36.920]   book of Acts, the apostle Paul, the prisoner, addressing Felix and Drusilla. And this is
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:43.120]   what we read, "And as Paul reasoned with them of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:50.080]   to come, Felix trembled. And he stopped Paul and said, 'I will hear thee again of this
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.680]   matter. Go thy way now. I will hear thee again of this matter.'" What's happening there?
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.840]   What makes a man tremble? You often listen to things you don't agree with, but yet they
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.880]   don't make you tremble, do they? But here's a man trembling. He's a great Roman governor,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.680]   but he trembles. His knees knocked one against the other. Felix trembled. Why, oh, it was
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.080]   the conviction of the Holy Ghost, but he resists. That's why, you see, it's so essential to
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.680]   draw the distinction between these two meanings. There's convicting, but come, there's something
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:27.640]   else. It also carries the notion of convincing. Now, here is a man, you see, who agrees with
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.240]   the sentence. Here's a man who pleads guilty. He's not only convicted, he's convinced. And
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.400]   this is, of course, the great story that we read of in this book. That's what happened
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.360]   to the three thousand on the day of Pentecost. They were terribly convicted. That's why they
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.360]   cried out in agony, saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" But they also believed,
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.440]   they agreed, they repented and were baptized, and they joined the apostles. You get the
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   same thing with the other two thousand I've referred to. You get it happening under the
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.480]   preaching of Philip down in Samaria. You get it happening when Philip preaches to just
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:11.280]   one man, the Ethiopian eunuch. And you get the other examples, the household of Cornelius,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:19.120]   Cornelius and his household. Lydia there in Philippi, oh, there's no end to this. This
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:25.200]   is the thing, you see, that the apostle Paul is talking about in so many of his epistles.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.800]   That's what he meant in writing to the Thessalonians. It wasn't in word only, but in power and the
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:38.360]   Holy Ghost and in much assurance. And he became followers of us and of the Lord. He received
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:45.120]   the truth in much affliction. You turn from idols to serve the living and the true God.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.720]   These men are not only convicted, they're convinced. And our Lord, what he's saying
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.040]   is this, you see, he says when he comes, when the Spirit comes, he will convict, he will
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:06.000]   convince. And both aspects are of tremendous and vital importance. Where's the difference,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.480]   you say? Well, let me show you. He says he will convict the whole world. And the whole
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:22.720]   world is convicted by the coming of the Holy Spirit. The very fact that the Holy Spirit
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:32.800]   came on the day of Pentecost convicts the world, the whole world. How well he is a verification
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:40.200]   of the prophecies. He is in any special way a fulfillment of the promises that were given
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:46.240]   by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. He said don't be upset, let not your heart be troubled.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   I'm not going to leave you orphans. I'm going to send you another comforter. It's
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.720]   good for you that I go away, for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:01.560]   But if I go away I will send him unto you, and so on. Well, now he'd said all that,
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:08.120]   but if he didn't do it, well, he'd be convicted as being wrong. But he's done it. So the
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.960]   coming of the Holy Spirit is a proof of who he is, and he convicts all who don't believe
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:20.800]   in him. Now then, you see these things I say must always be considered and they must always
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:28.640]   be taken together. He convicts by his very coming on the day of Pentecost. He establishes
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:37.200]   Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God. But he also does it in another way. He does the second
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:47.240]   part particularly, the convincing part, in this way, by enabling men and women to believe.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.840]   You see, his very coming establishes facts. He convicts the whole world, but he convinces
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:02.360]   some. And what I want to impress upon your minds, my dear friends, is just this, that
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:09.400]   it is he alone who can do that. Nobody can convince anybody about the truth of these
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:16.360]   things apart from the Holy Spirit. You see, that is why our Lord said to these apostles,
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:23.520]   "Tarry in Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high." They knew all the facts,
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.160]   they'd been eyewitnesses of them, but it's no good. They'll never convince anybody until
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:35.840]   the power of the Spirit is upon them. He alone can enlighten and convince. And what he does,
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:42.520]   you see, is to divide mankind into two groups, those who are only convicted and those who
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:49.240]   are also convinced. I read the second chapter of 1 Corinthians to you at the beginning because
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.800]   the whole thing is put before us there with unusual clarity. The world is divided into
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.880]   two groups. Who are they? Well, the apostle says, "Which none of the princes of this world
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:08.080]   knew." The princes of this world, the great men, the philosophers, members of royal families,
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:15.640]   leaders in science and in thought, they don't know Christ. They're blind. There's one group,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.120]   the natural men, "Receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:26.800]   unto him." Foolishness to the Greek. There's all your human wisdom. There's one group.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:32.320]   But thank God there's another group, listen, "But God hath revealed them unto us by his
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:38.160]   Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. We have received
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.440]   not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, in order that we might know
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:48.240]   the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak not in the
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.960]   words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:38:02.160]   things with spiritual. He that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.960]   of no men." The world is divided into two groups tonight, men and women who are convicted,
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:16.600]   men and women who are convinced. And it is the Holy Spirit alone who can convince anybody
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.560]   of these wonderful works of God. They've happened, the majority in this country doesn't
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:28.880]   believe them tonight, why not? Oh, they've never been convinced by the Holy Ghost. The
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.160]   Apostle said, "I didn't come with wisdom. I didn't come with enticing words of men's
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.880]   wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God. I was with you in weakness and fear and
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.480]   much trembling, and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom,
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.320]   and remember that includes all methods, no entertainment, no playing about with lights
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.880]   and putting on a show and entertaining people in order to get at them and to win them, psychological
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:08.760]   treatment. No, no, he abhors any such suggestion. Not with enticing words of men's wisdom,
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:14.440]   but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. There were no tricks in the work of
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.680]   the Apostle Paul. He says that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, in
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:27.520]   the cleverness and the tricks and the games of men, but in the power of God. He alone
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.440]   can do it. You can get adherents, but you don't make Christians. You can get people
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.640]   to join your church, but you don't make them Christians. Thereby, the Holy Spirit alone
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:49.320]   can convince. And then our Lord goes on to tell us how he does it. He does it always
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   in terms of the truth. A man who doesn't know what he believes cannot be a Christian
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:04.000]   by definition. The Holy Spirit always uses the truth, the word of God, thy word, and
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:12.360]   our Lord tells us what it does. Here it is all put before us. When he has come, he shall
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.600]   convict and convince the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment. Those are
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:24.600]   his themes, and they are his themes tonight, my dear friends. This is still the message
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:30.960]   of Christianity. The word, the word of God, the prohibited word, the word that the authorities
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:38.000]   don't like, it's a word about sin. What's that? Disobedience of God, self-will, going
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.520]   your own way, turning your back upon God, refusing what he tells you in any shape or
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:50.360]   form. But our Lord particularizes, you notice, and he puts it like this. Of sin, he says,
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:59.800]   he will convict the world of sin in this way, because they believe not on me. What does
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:08.720]   he mean by this? Well, it means just this. There is nothing that so demonstrates and
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:22.640]   proves man's sinfulness as his failure to recognize the Son of God. He shall convict,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:32.320]   notice, the world of sin because they believe not on me. Oh, let me put it to you briefly
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   and hurriedly like this. He's talking here, you see, about the blindness of mankind in
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:44.960]   failing to recognize him. As Paul has reminded us, this is as true of the princes of this
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.800]   world as it is of the common people. The fact that you've read a number of books doesn't
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.640]   help you to become a Christian at all. You're in the same position as the man who's read
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.120]   nothing. That's Christianity. It doesn't depend in any shape or form upon man's wisdom.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.880]   Oh, you say, but I thought you told us just now not to let ourselves go. I'm still saying
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.880]   that. I'm saying that your reading, your wisdom that you've gone off from books isn't
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:15.160]   going to help you. But I say the Holy Spirit is addressing you with truth to your mind,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:22.440]   and he wants you to use it. You must know what you believe. And here it is, you see,
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:30.240]   that the world is convicted of its sin, the blindness that failed to recognize him. We
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:37.080]   are coming to the Advent season. It's the blindness that didn't recognize the babe in
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:46.520]   the manger. Charles Wesley looks at him and says, "Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see."
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:54.320]   Hail incarnate deity. The wise men recognized him. They brought their gifts. You remember
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:02.640]   them, don't you? Frankincense and myrrh, these wonderful spices and aroma. They were coming
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:09.040]   to acknowledge a king. They saw him. The world didn't. The world. It was the world, you
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.320]   see, that wouldn't make room in the inn for his mother about to give birth to him and
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:21.640]   the babe to be born in a stable with the cattle in the straw. The world didn't know him, and
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:28.080]   this is how it's convicted of sin. It didn't recognize him. The boy in the temple, the
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.040]   carpenter, this unusual man, the young man bursting forth to preach at the age of 30.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.000]   They had to admit that they'd never heard such gracious lips falling off anybody, gracious
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.160]   words falling off anybody's lips, and yet they didn't recognize him. They stumbled at
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:51.440]   him, and at last they crucified him, rejecting him. The blindness that fails to recognize
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   him, that's due to sin. And the Holy Spirit convicts men of that, because they believe
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:04.920]   not on me. And secondly, the blindness, you see, that made them blind to their need of
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:10.400]   him. They stood up and they looked him in the face, and they questioned him. They even
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.600]   tried to beat him in argument. They tried to trap him, and they tried to weave a web
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.720]   around him. They thought they were clever. They were standing up to the Son of God. Are
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:26.760]   you? If you are, you're the biggest fool in the universe, and at the same time the biggest
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:33.600]   sinner. Sin is that which fails to recognize him, because it's never seen its need of him.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.480]   The self-sufficient men who can judge God and Christ and judge everything, can't live
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.800]   its own life, of course, but doesn't hesitate to express its great opinions. Oh, the blindness,
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:49.920]   the sinfulness of mankind that hasn't seen its need to such an extent that when he comes,
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:58.520]   it falls at his feet and says, "Thank God he's come. The Savior has arrived." Of sin,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.920]   because they believe not in me. And then of righteousness, of righteousness because I
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:11.320]   go to my Father and ye see me no more. What does this mean? Well, it just means this.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:18.560]   He claimed to be the righteous one. He said, "The Father and I are one." And the clever
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.640]   world looked at him and said, "This man's a blasphemer. This man says he's equal with
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:29.720]   God. He claims he's come from God. He has said before Abraham was, 'I am.' The Father
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.920]   and I are one. He who hath seen me hath seen the Father." They said, "This man is an imposter.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:44.040]   He's a liar. He's a blasphemer. He's unrighteous. Away with him." But he says, "The Holy Spirit
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:52.080]   when he comes will prove that I am the righteous one that I claim to be." And of course it
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:58.280]   does. The resurrection proved it in itself. But then he sends the Holy Ghost as he said
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:04.720]   he would, and this is the final and the absolute proof. He's the Son of God and he's been
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.800]   given the gift by his Father and he showers it upon his people. He is the righteous one.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.700]   He will convince the world of righteousness because I go unto my Father and ye see me
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:23.480]   no more. But there's a second meaning to this. He means this. The Holy Spirit teaches us
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:32.000]   and convinces us that he alone can make us righteous. And that's what you and I need,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.400]   isn't it? How can a man be just with God? What can I do about my sins? How can I get
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:44.560]   rid of them? How can I stand before God in judgment? How can I pray to God while I'm
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.760]   still in this world? Can I live a good and a clean and a pure life? Is it possible? Is
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.840]   there any righteousness possible to a mortal man? We know failure, sin, degradation. Oh,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:01.640]   is it possible for a man to be righteous? Is it possible for a man to approach God without
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:08.800]   terror and alarm? Is it possible for a man to pray with a holy boldness to the Holy One
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:16.760]   seated upon the throne of the universe? And what our Lord is saying is this. When he comes,
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:25.040]   he will convince men that there's only one way whereby they can ever be made righteous.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:35.120]   And that is by believing in me. He constantly said that. He said the Son of Man has come
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.840]   to seek and to save that which is lost. The Son of Man has not come to be ministered unto
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:46.200]   but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. Why did he come? Why was that babe
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.960]   born in Bethlehem? What are you going to remember on Christmas Day? What's the point of it all?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.760]   Is this the Son of God? If he is, why did he ever come into the world? Why was he born
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.880]   like that? Why did he live? Oh, supremely I ask, why did he ever die? Why did he ever
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:09.400]   die such a death? Why? There's only one answer. There was none other good enough to pay the
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:16.480]   price of sin. He only could unlock the gates of heaven and let us in. If there had been
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.840]   any other way, there would have been another way. But God had to make him to be sin for
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:30.400]   us who knew no sin in order that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. The
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.880]   Holy Spirit alone will enable a man to see that. A man stands up and says, "Right, I'm
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.640]   ready to meet God. I've lived a good life. I've never got drunk. I've never committed
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.840]   adultery. I'm not guilty of murder. I'm a man who's always lived to do good. I've never
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:48.920]   done anybody any harm." He stands on his own feet and he'll be blown away like the chaff
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:57.080]   as the first psalm puts it. Righteousness, your righteousness as the Old Testament puts
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:04.840]   it is nothing but filthy rags. "You are they," says our Lord, "to the Pharisees who justify
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:10.880]   yourselves before men, but God seeth the heart and that which is highly esteemed amongst
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:18.280]   men is abomination in the sight of God." Let Saul of Tarsus have the last word. "Glorying
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:24.400]   in his righteousness as a Pharisee, as a Hebrew of the Hebrews of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:32.320]   the seventh day and all the rest of it, touching the righteousness which is of the law, blameless.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:39.960]   But what things were gained to me, them I counted loss for Christ. Yea, I count all
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:48.280]   things but loss. It is but as done in refuse that I might know that righteousness which
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:55.520]   is of faith, the righteousness of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith."
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.040]   What brings him to see that? The Holy Ghost? The proud Pharisee has to be convicted and
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:06.560]   convinced and smashed. And there he cries out, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.040]   He surrenders to the righteousness of the righteous one, the one who has died that his
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:17.400]   sins might be blooded out, who is offering him his own righteousness to be clothed with
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:23.040]   it and to enable him to say, "Centuries before Count Zinzendorf and John Wesley were
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:31.440]   born, Jesus, thy blood and righteousness, my beauty are my glorious dress, midst flaming
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:41.920]   worlds in this arrayed, with joy shall I lift up my head." He'll convince of righteousness.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.880]   Because I go unto the Father there ever to live and to intercede on behalf of those who
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:53.200]   believe in me and to guarantee their righteousness to all eternity.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:59.680]   And lastly, judgment to come. Of judgment to come, he says, because the prince of this
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:07.800]   world is judged. What's that mean? Well, the prince of this world is the devil. And
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:14.560]   he says that the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, using the word, is going to convict and convince
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:23.600]   concerning judgment, this judgment, this final judgment. And the way he'll do that, he
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:32.280]   says, is in demonstrating that the prince of this world, or the devil, is already judged.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:37.240]   How does he do that? Well, you see, if you know the facts, if you know the wonderful
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.880]   works of God, if you know the things that Peter and John and the other apostles have
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:51.360]   seen and have heard, you know the answer, don't you? It's this. The cross and the resurrection
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:59.000]   are a complete defeat of the devil. Complete. Our Lord said it before he died. He says,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:07.600]   now is the prince of this world cast out. Now comes the judgment of this world. Now
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:14.640]   shall the prince of this world be cast out. Read it for yourselves in John 12. He knew
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:22.360]   it and he did it. As Paul puts it in writing to the Colossians, on the cross he put principalities
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:28.000]   and powers to an open shame, triumphing over them by it. They thought they'd got him.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.640]   This was the ultimate achievement. At last they've trapped him. They've worked it
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.440]   so beautifully, this imposter. Now they're going to deal with him. They're going to
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.120]   put an end to him. They're going to kill him. They're going to bury him. That's
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:45.600]   the end. They thought they'd succeeded, but he rose and he sent the Spirit. And thereby
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:53.760]   he has routed them completely. He proves they're all wrong and that he is all right. And completely
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:59.360]   so. Not only that, he does it not only in the cross and the resurrection. You know the
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.080]   fact that a single person has ever believed this gospel is a proof that the prince of
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:10.440]   this world has been defeated and cast out and judged. How do you prove that, says someone?
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:19.280]   Well you know this is a very simple thing. Why do men and women not believe this gospel?
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.200]   And the answer, one of the answers that is given is this, given by the Apostle Paul.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:30.580]   He says in the second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 4, in verses 3 and 4, something
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:35.800]   like this, let me read them to you. "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:44.680]   are lost, in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:50.520]   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:56.760]   them." Everybody in this congregation who doesn't believe this message is in that position
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:02.040]   for one reason. It's not your learning, it's not your academic qualifications, it's not
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.280]   the great science that we've got in the 20th century. Do you know what it is? The God of
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:14.920]   this world has blinded your eyes, your mind, lest you believe. You can't. He holds us all
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:24.760]   in captivity. And the fact that one soul has ever believed this gospel is an absolute proof
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:32.600]   in itself of the complete judging and defeating of the devil. Every man who ever believes
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:39.400]   this gospel does it in spite of the devil. Every time a man believes, the devil is defeated.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.880]   That's why, you know, the angels in heaven are singing. You remember our Lord in the
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:51.280]   parables? There is joy amongst the angels of heaven, about every sinner he says that
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:57.640]   repenteth. Why? Oh, they know, you see, they understand. They see this fiend that has dominated
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:03.920]   the world, the God of this world, that has turned men away from God and ruined the creation
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:10.040]   and brought disaster upon all the progeny of Adam. And he knows how he's held them
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.920]   captive. But here is a man believing that the devil has been defeated over one sinner
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.320]   that repenteth. There is rejoicing amongst the angels of heaven. It's an absolute defeat
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:28.480]   of the devil. He's already judged and defeated. And, of course, finally he does it by delivering
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.520]   us from the power of the devil. We are all under the dominion of sin and Satan by birth.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:41.080]   We are all the slaves of sin and of Satan. And there's only one thing that can ever
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:47.400]   deliver us from that, and that is this gospel preached with the unction and authority and
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:55.280]   power of the Holy Spirit. You know, our Lord himself told Saul of Tarsus this on the road
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.960]   to Damascus. When he arrested him and apprehended him, listen, he says, "Rise, stand upon
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.320]   a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   I will appear unto thee." Listen, "Delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:23.200]   unto whom now I send thee." What for? "To open their eyes and to turn them from darkness
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:34.840]   to light and from the power of Satan unto God." That's what he does. "And whenever
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:40.960]   a man is delivered in this way from the power of the world, the flesh and the devil, the
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.640]   power of sin and evil, it is a victory for Christ. The Holy Ghost has done it, and he
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:53.480]   has shown how Christ has defeated Satan and all his viles and power." But listen to
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:57:00.040]   Paul saying it once more. He is thanking God for the Colossians. He tells them in the first
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:05.400]   chapter, verses 12 and following, "Giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:12.760]   meet, fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:24.040]   us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son." That
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:29.760]   involves the defeat of the devil every time. He doesn't want to lose a single citizen.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.080]   He'll hold on to you. He'll ridicule this gospel. He'll ridicule preaching. He'll
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   make you read articles that say it's all rubbish. He'll put scientists before you
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.600]   on your television screen. He'll give you great names, and they're all against it.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.640]   He'll do everything. There's nothing he won't do just to hold you in captivity.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:55.840]   But thank God, "He that is with us is greater than he that is in the world." The Holy Spirit
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:01.840]   can open blind eyes. He is God, remember, the Holy Ghost. He can give life anew. He
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.880]   regenerates as well as convicts. He can give power of understanding. He can give you the
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.800]   mind of Christ. He can reveal the hidden things to you, and you'll see them and you'll
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.400]   believe them, and you'll begin to rejoice in them. "The strong and armed keepeth his
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.760]   goods at peace, but when a stronger than he cometh, he despoileth him of his armour in
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.560]   which he trusted, and He sets His goods at liberty.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.480]   Here is the message.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.160]   He shall do this.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:35.320]   He shall convince and convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgement.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:41.160]   The devil is judged, the Spirit proves it and you and I can be free.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.280]   Free to believe God.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   Free to enjoy God.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.880]   Free to worship God.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.600]   Free to pray to God.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:56.960]   Free to live in a manner that is worthy of the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:04.000]   The Holy Ghost convicts you, me, the whole world.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.640]   That's a fact.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.040]   He's done it.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.960]   And He will do it at the final judgement.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:22.800]   So I ask you a question, you are already convicted, but my dear friend, are you convinced, you
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:32.520]   like everybody else, are a hopeless, helpless, doomed and damned sinner?
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.800]   Nothing that can recommend you to God.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:42.760]   Are you convinced that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and that when He died on that
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.360]   cross He was dying for your sin?
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.920]   Amen.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.840]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
