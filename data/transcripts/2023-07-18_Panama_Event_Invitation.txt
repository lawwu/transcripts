[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.520]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   I'm your host.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.640]   And on today's podcast, I'm going to share with you some useful information and ideas,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.320]   especially focused on the topic of international planning.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.800]   I'm going to share with you some ideas about one nation in specific.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.080]   That nation is Panama, and how it can be a useful tool in your international planning
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080]   toolbox.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.920]   And I'm going to invite you to sign up for a private one-week event, which I am co-hosting
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.680]   in January of 2024.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.360]   That one-week event will be located in Panama City, Panama.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.160]   And what I'm doing is, together with my friends, Mikkel Thorup, founder of expatmoney.com,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.040]   as well as Gabriel Custodiat, founder of Watchman Privacy, whom I've worked with on a number
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.840]   of courses, et cetera, we are presenting and co-hosting a private one-week event.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.600]   Think of it as almost an investment tour of the nation of Panama.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.160]   It's going to be very limited access, very limited numbers of people, really nice luxury
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.960]   event for one week.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.960]   And I want you to come and spend a week with me and with my friends in Panama.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.360]   If you'd like to just skip straight to and say, "Well, that's it.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360]   I'm up.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   I'm ready to go," go to expatmoney.com/radical.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.480]   Link is in the show notes.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480]   You can go there.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   You can read the sales page.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.400]   All the information is there, and you can sign up.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.760]   In the course of this podcast, I will share with you some details.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.160]   First, I'm going to share with you a little bit about my story with internationalization
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.400]   and why I have become so heavily involved in this space, because it's not necessarily
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.160]   a normal expression for many financial planners and many people's finances, et cetera.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.440]   I'm going to share with you a bit of a framework as to how you approach internationalization.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.360]   I'm going to share with you a little bit about the nation of Panama and how it can be a very
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.040]   useful tool, and then I will share with you all the details of this event, let you know
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.160]   what you can expect when you come and hang out with me in January.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.240]   Let's begin with my pathway into internationalization.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.880]   Though newer listeners of Radical Personal Finance might be surprised by this, for me,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.120]   my international endeavors and my international focus is a relatively new thing in my life.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.960]   Up until about four to five years ago, it's not something that I ever conceived of, thought
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.280]   of, or spent much time involved with.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.800]   I was born and raised in the United States of America, and I had, I think, a fairly normal
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   experience of doing that.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.080]   When I say normal, what I mean is I didn't think a lot about the world outside of the
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   United States.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.320]   I did enjoy traveling.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.000]   I traveled more than many people, but certainly not as much as some.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.920]   That travel was something that I enjoyed, but I never imagined moving to another country
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.360]   or doing things in another country, etc.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.960]   Most Americans don't.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.780]   Most Americans have a mindset that basically involves doing everything inside of the United
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.080]   States, and that's not something that I think should really be criticized.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.240]   I don't like to engage in America bashing.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.120]   I think it's a very common thing.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.000]   Because the country is large and powerful and wealthy, people enjoy beating up on Americans,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.160]   and I line up to defend Americans against many of those things.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   I think we deserve a good set of criticism.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.400]   I've got a long list of criticisms of my own, but there are some areas in which the criticism
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.120]   just falls flat, is an example that I like to use.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.140]   Things like passport ownership.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.760]   Many times, people around the world like to make fun of Americans for having a relatively
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.840]   low rate of passport ownership and for not traveling internationally all that much.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.880]   This is different than many other wealthy countries of the world.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.800]   By the way, first, those numbers are often not as extreme as they're represented.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.480]   Years ago, I would hear things like, "Well, 15% of Americans have passports."
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   That's nonsense.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.080]   I don't know what the current number is, but it's much higher than it was, probably due
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.240]   to the fact that now, unlike previously when it was easy to travel to Mexico and Canada
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.880]   with a birth certificate, etc., now you need more and more of a passport, and all the Secure
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.520]   ID stuff is probably more of a factor as to why.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.840]   The point remains that Americans have something of a lower rate of passport ownership than
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.180]   many other nations in the world.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.800]   If I hear people bashing Americans for that, I quickly pipe up and say, "Listen, how much
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.120]   do you know about the United States?
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   Have you been there?
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.400]   Do you understand anything about the geography of the country?"
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.240]   It's a little bit hard to listen to, say, a Polish guy bashing the United States if
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.680]   you understand something about the geography of Poland versus the geography of the United
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   States.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.320]   Generally speaking, there's little to no reason for Americans to go to any other nation if
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.840]   they're looking to fulfill any kind of basic thing that they want to do on vacation.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.200]   Because within the country, especially due to its latitude and even the longitude that
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.280]   it covers, basically almost every climate zone is represented, virtually every activity
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.540]   is represented.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.200]   If you want to go surfing on the beach, we've got that.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.620]   If you want to go skiing on the mountain, we've got world-class skiing.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.960]   If you want to go shopping in the big city, we've got that.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.760]   If you want to go to a spa town, we've got that.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.880]   Virtually anything that you can think of, or at least that I can think of, you can do
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.140]   inside the United States, everything from desert sand dunes to snowy white-capped mountains.
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.480]   In many cases, the activities that are available for vacation, et cetera, in the United States
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.080]   are world-class.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.000]   I can't think of really anything in which there's not a spot in the United States in
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.400]   which the facilities or the expression of that activity is not world-class.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.720]   That's really unique and really worth paying attention to.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.960]   The United States being such a large nation means that even traveling within the country
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.920]   itself takes time.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.360]   It takes hours to fly from one side of the United States to the other.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.080]   If you understand that, it can be just rather bothersome to think then about going 12 hours
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.640]   to the other side of the world if you can have pretty much just about anything that
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.000]   you want within a few hours' drive in some cases or within a few hours' flight.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.720]   Then when you get into just the simple conveniences of modern life and the facilities for virtually
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.840]   any activity that are available in the United States, it's just so easy, so much easier
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.600]   than going abroad in many cases.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.960]   I'm one who has gone to many countries and I go to the hard ones and the easy ones.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.440]   The more I travel, the more I appreciate how easy everything is in the United States.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.520]   I think unless people have some kind of weird fixation with travel and going to the hard
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.280]   places like I do, then generally speaking, I don't fault people for going to a nice resort
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.720]   that's a few hours away or going to a nice ski slope that's near where they are instead
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   of going to Argentina.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.400]   It's just easier to stay within what you know and a lot cheaper, better service, better
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.880]   and cheaper in so many regards.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.040]   So all that to say that I don't have any grudges against the United States and I never imagined
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.600]   really living anywhere else until about four or five years ago.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.680]   I guess it's actually more than that now.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.800]   But what started to make me pay attention was when I started to watch a lot of the chaos
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.920]   surrounding national politics in 2015, 2016, 2017, etc.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.140]   And I started to become very uncomfortable with my own future and the future of my children
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.240]   being tied to one country, a country that I increasingly didn't recognize and increasingly
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   don't recognize.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.960]   A lot of my sense of familiarity was just eroding and I thought, "What on earth is going
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   on?
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   I don't understand this."
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.240]   And there were a few specific issues that were national level issues that caused me
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.800]   myself to become uncomfortable.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.880]   And I thought it would be really nice if we had some other options.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.520]   At the time, my wife and I had a bunch of children and we're young bit children and
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.180]   I didn't know a lot of what to do with it, but this was in the back of my mind.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.240]   And that was when I stumbled across an idea of what I've talked about in the podcast.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.960]   I'm not going to go deep into it, called flag theory.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.160]   And basically flag theory was an idea that was invented in the 1980s by a bunch of rich
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.460]   libertarian playboys who wanted to live freely in what they saw as an increasingly unfree
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.080]   world.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.840]   And that always resonated with me.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.880]   Now there's two aspects to that.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.760]   The very well-known book by Harry Brown, right?
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.000]   Harry Brown, How to Live Free in an Unfree World, I think is really excellent.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.600]   And that book doesn't involve running away from the problem.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.520]   It just talks about how to free yourself from the system and how to live freely in an unfree
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   world.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.560]   I haven't read that in a few years, but I've read it and recommended it.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   No problem.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.280]   But then the flip side of it is, well, what can we actually do if we start to face something
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.600]   that affects us?
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.360]   What if we face some kind of persecution?
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.480]   What if we face some kind of issues?
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.680]   What if our country just starts to impose unreasonable taxes or things start to fall
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.680]   apart, et cetera?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.920]   And that was one of the things that opened my eyes up to thinking about going to other
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   places.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.280]   And I thought, you know what, if I at least had an option to go to another country, that
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   could solve some specific, basically national level threats.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.360]   I was very concerned and still am concerned about things like taxation.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.480]   I didn't want my children, I'm sitting here looking at a bankrupt government, increasing
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.640]   national debt, et cetera.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.360]   And I thought, you know, I myself don't think this debt's ever going to get paid off.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.520]   I expect it to be defaulted on myself.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.320]   But let's say I'm wrong.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.040]   Do I really want my children to be tied to this country?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   And do I want my children to be enslaved in a form, indebted, becoming indentured servants
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   to a government to pay off the debts of their grandparents that they didn't vote for?
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.680]   That's not right.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.320]   That's not just.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.800]   And yet I'm the one who has to do something about that.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.360]   Because if I don't do something about that, maybe too late someday.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.920]   Don't I have a responsibility as a father to make certain that my children are free,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.440]   that they have the option to go to other places?
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.640]   I worried and still worry about things like military conscription.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.720]   The United States has had an all-volunteer army since the Vietnam War.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.360]   But that all-volunteer army is massively underneath its recruiting targets.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.280]   And I always worried, what if the government drafted my children?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.980]   And as they became increasingly anti-war, as I grew older, I became, you know, to see
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.120]   most of the wars that my nation was involved with as stupid and pointless and immoral.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.320]   I thought, don't I owe it to my children to make certain that if a government passed
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.560]   a draft notice that they don't have to flee to Canada in the middle of the night like
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.400]   so many did during the Vietnam War?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.480]   Wouldn't it be nice if they just simply could go to a different country and live there as
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.000]   a citizen and have a different set of travel documents, etc.?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.880]   I started to look at financial issues and everything from increasing regulation on,
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.240]   you know, Patriot Act stuff and lack of privacy.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.560]   And I thought to myself, don't I owe it to my children to make sure that we have – that
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.160]   we're not dependent on one country?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   I'll stop there.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.440]   I don't want to go too deep.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:27.180]   And then this was – this also occurred with my paying a lot of attention to financial
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.120]   stuff and financial trends.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.200]   When I was a formal financial advisor years ago, I was the guy that people would come
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.600]   to and ask questions about gold investing.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.440]   They would be talking about mutual funds and they would have a client who says, "But
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.160]   I want to buy gold."
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.120]   And a lot of times the advisor didn't know much about it.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.360]   They'd send me an email, "Hey, talk to my client about gold because at least you
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.960]   can give him some decent advice about buying gold.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.840]   It's not just crazy."
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.240]   And so it was interesting in this stuff for a long time.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.740]   As I watched financial collapses and thought about all of the doom and gloom prophecies
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.360]   of the future, I came to realize the legitimacy of going to another place.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.480]   It was probably – I think it was probably sparked by John Reed's original book.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.560]   Years ago, John T. Reed wrote a book called How to Survive Hyperinflation or something
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.640]   like that.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.800]   And his basic point in that book was he laid out the idea that just don't be where the
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.680]   hyperinflation is and go to another place.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.120]   He didn't talk about residency permits, things like that, or passports.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.580]   He just talked about going as a tourist.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:35.680]   But it opened my eyes to recognize that economic crises are largely national level things.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.360]   They're not international.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   They do make a difference.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.980]   If the United States sneezes, the world catches a cold.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   That exists.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.140]   But the really bad stuff, the million percent hyperinflation, the total collapse, these
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.240]   are national level events and they're not contagious.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.940]   The collapse in Venezuela doesn't automatically lead to a contagion that affects Brazil and
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940]   Colombia.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.700]   Those countries each have their own unique situations.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.340]   And as I watched that, I realized that you can avoid most problems if you just go to
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.340]   another country.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.420]   So that's where I myself got heavily involved in international planning.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:17.300]   And it began with basically an idea to say, "I want to make sure that I and my children
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:23.940]   can choose which country treats them the best and choose which country they want to interact
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.540]   with and they're not beholden to one country."
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.700]   Because I believe in the importance of competition.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:36.020]   And while I believe and acknowledge publicly, repeatedly, that the United States is world
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.420]   class at so many things, any company, any person, no matter how good they get or no
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:48.380]   matter how good they are, if they don't have competition, they quickly start to disrespect
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.380]   their customers.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.620]   And it's much healthier to have a world of many strong players because that competition
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.660]   keeps everybody focused on protecting their customers.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:05.780]   So it started in 2019 when my wife and I went abroad with our then three children, went
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.060]   abroad for birth tourism to have our fourth baby abroad, and it has continued on since
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.060]   then.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.020]   So about four to five years now.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.500]   And I just basically haven't really gotten around to going back to the United States.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.820]   I still think I probably will in the future, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:30.380]   I continue to enjoy building and having robust plans around the world and just enjoying the
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.140]   international lifestyle while also acknowledging where, you know what, I think there are certain
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.420]   things that I really appreciate more about the United States.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:45.620]   And doing this has brought me an incredible sense of freedom, an incredible sense of peace,
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.620]   et cetera.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.660]   I laid out my plan in 2019.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.340]   I was a DIYer and I went and I looked and I got all the information I could find.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.680]   The first book I had ever read on it was the original one by W.G. Hill called PT.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.020]   That was where I started.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.820]   Then I started to find more of the modern resources and I studied the countries and
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.380]   I laid it all out and I made up my flag theory plan and I went and did it.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.380]   I did it.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.380]   I was a DIYer.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.380]   I didn't hire a consultant.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.900]   I just went and did it.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.740]   And along the way, I made a ton of mistakes.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:23.500]   I spent huge amounts of money unnecessarily, things that I could save today.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   But I've enjoyed it.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   It's fun.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   I like a challenge.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.300]   But today, I just feel this incredible sense of relief that I'm no longer dependent on
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.640]   one country.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.100]   For me, for my family, for my children, I've done all the stuff.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.100]   I've checked it all off.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.780]   I've got flags planted in other countries.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:45.020]   If I never wanted to go back to the United States again, never wanted to use my U.S.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:50.540]   passport, never had a dime in the country, etc., I don't need the United States.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.860]   And that has actually brought me to a place of greater peace with the country than when
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.060]   I was entirely in it.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.140]   I think of it sometimes, I don't love this analogy, but it's probably the most apt, is
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.900]   that if you talk to somebody who's in the midst of frustration and anger and fighting
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:12.260]   nonstop with his spouse, it seems like all the guy can do is say everything that's wrong
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.420]   with his wife and what a horrible woman she is.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.580]   It's about all he can see.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.580]   And then a lot of times, the relationship ends, they go on their way, and you come by
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.380]   some years later, and if you catch the guy in a moment of honesty, he'll acknowledge,
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.900]   "Hey, there were some things that were really frustrating about what she did, but at the
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.440]   end of the day, it wasn't all bad and it wasn't all her."
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.340]   And that's kind of how I feel about the United States, is that today, having rounded the
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:41.020]   corner, I can look at the world with a lot more peace and equanimity and just relaxation.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.980]   I don't see everything as, "It's going to catastrophe."
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:50.140]   I see things in a more moderate way, and I just appreciate the good things about the
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.140]   country.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.900]   And that's something that I'm grateful for and that I want for you, if that's something
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.420]   that appeals to you.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.580]   And so internationalization is the process of basically figuring out different places
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.340]   in the world that might provide you with more of what you want and less of what you don't
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.420]   want.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:16.380]   Because in many ways, you can't change much about the place that you live, but you can
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.200]   change the place that you live.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.940]   You can't change much about the country of your birth, but you can change the country
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.700]   of your children's birth.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:32.140]   The environment that you live in, the environment that you choose for yourself, is something
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.740]   that you can choose.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.180]   People don't think it is, and yet it is.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.860]   And that's where I have realized that when we go out in the world and we're careful about
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.700]   the things that we build, and we build a sense of freedom for ourselves, it can bring all
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.100]   kinds of benefits.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.380]   Now I've mostly talked about some legal stuff and kind of emotional stuff.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.140]   There's a whole slew of other benefits that can be achieved.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.860]   Tax planning that's available in the international space is phenomenal.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.660]   Having been a financial advisor in the United States, I had previously had a very one-sided
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.540]   view of tax planning.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.620]   I knew what there was in the tax code, but I didn't know anything about other tax codes.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.820]   I didn't know anything about what was available from an international perspective.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.820]   And it's very common.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.820]   I still find this today.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.780]   I'll talk to great, very well-informed financial advisors, accountants, et cetera, and I open
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.860]   up just the most simple of comments from an international perspective, and they don't
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.600]   know anything about it.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.060]   And after all, why would they?
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.140]   Because the United States, we think in terms of what state offers the best tax code.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.320]   We don't think in terms of countries.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.460]   And as I started to realize, wait a second, I can save tens of thousands of dollars a
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.900]   year completely legally on my taxes, hundreds of thousands in some cases, and I can do this
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.900]   completely legally?
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.340]   Wait a second, you're telling me I can make 10 million bucks a year and live 100% tax
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.340]   free?
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   That's amazing.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.500]   Like, there's a whole new world out there that I discovered.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.740]   And as I went through the process of doing that and having some money put aside and having
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.620]   money in other bank accounts, having money in other currencies, et cetera, just brought
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.100]   me incredible opportunities.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.620]   And so that was my pathway into international planning.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.940]   What does that have to do with you?
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.660]   Well, it's become a common theme on radical personal finance.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.340]   It's something that people ask questions about.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.540]   I answer this stuff on Friday Q&A shows.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.540]   I have courses on it, right?
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.540]   Internationalescapeplan.com.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.580]   I teach an entire course on how to do this stuff, et cetera.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:40.180]   But what I have not done is I have tried not to get heavily into talking about specific
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.180]   jurisdictions, specific places, specific countries.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.980]   I keep the details of my own planning somewhat private.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:52.260]   And while I talk about individual countries, say on a Friday Q&A show, et cetera, and I
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:58.260]   don't run away from the conversation, what happens is that I like my stuff to be fairly
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.300]   evergreen.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.900]   I don't want my stuff to sound so totally dated.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:08.580]   Stuff changes so quickly in the international space that I try to avoid that.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.260]   The other thing that I try to be really careful of is the need for customized planning.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.620]   Because just like good financial planning should be very individualized, it's even more
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.300]   important that good international planning be very individualized.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.020]   Because each of our circumstances is so different from one another.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.220]   We have different interests, different abilities, different tolerances.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.780]   We all desire different lifestyles.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.280]   We speak different languages.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   We have different backgrounds.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.820]   There are different things that are important to us.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:44.200]   And so international planning should begin with a knowledgeable, competent planner who
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.380]   is sitting and talking with someone who could pull those things out and not approach it
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.500]   from a hardcore specific place.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.940]   So I don't – this is the country.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:59.740]   And because so many of the people who promote – so this business has a lot of money in
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   it.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.860]   There's a lot of people who get involved and they promote this program, that program,
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.860]   et cetera.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:11.260]   And when you are paid by, I don't know, St. Kitts and Nevis commissions for suggesting
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.000]   their citizenship, then it's hard to consider other options.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.460]   And that's often what happens is the people do one thing.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.420]   They have a financial interest and they suggest this is the way it's always done.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.900]   So I want to be – I think you should always be very careful.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:30.620]   You should approach the world very openly and go with what seems the most appropriate.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.980]   If you're thinking about it, planning it, et cetera, you should look at the world very
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.980]   broadly.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:41.220]   What I have found, however, is that there are a number of areas where people are really
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.480]   consistent about being concerned about and especially from my listening audience.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.940]   My listening audience being English speakers with a mass majority in the United States,
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:57.340]   a second largest exposure in Canada and Great Britain, obviously as English-speaking countries,
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.060]   and then a significant portion in some of the larger nations in Europe, Germany, France,
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.360]   et cetera, and then with a sprinkling all around the world.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.420]   But that's where most of my listening audience is.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.540]   And if you talk with enough Americans and Canadians and Germans, et cetera, about what
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.180]   they're concerned about or what they want to think about in terms of their planning,
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.740]   there are a few basic themes that come out.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.380]   Some of those themes involve things like personal freedom.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:29.620]   Very few people want to go out and put in – and get a citizenship in Russia right
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:36.260]   now or China, et cetera, because of the lack of personal freedoms and personal choices.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.100]   People are frequently concerned about lifestyle.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:44.120]   If you come from a place where living is pretty good, one of the reasons you got rich was
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.860]   not so you could go and live in a slum.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.100]   Physical safety, big concern.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.300]   Linguistic compatibility.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:57.020]   Tax rates, tax laws, other onerous laws and regulations, et cetera.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:02.380]   And when you do this and you share these basic things that we have in common from a cultural
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.620]   perspective and you look at the menu of world choices that's out there, the different
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:13.460]   countries and what they offer, you go through a fairly consistent process.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.800]   And there are things that are just simply – all of us have concerns.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.980]   So let's say that you're like me and you are an American living in the United States
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.420]   and you'd like to get connected with another country and you'd like to start setting
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.940]   some stuff up in another country and you're looking at the world and saying, "All right,
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.180]   but what offers do I have out there?"
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:41.940]   Well, you're going to start by looking close to home and the closest to home nations for
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:48.460]   Americans involve places like Canada, Mexico, big countries, Bahamas, some of the Caribbean
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:54.220]   nations, et cetera, and then Central America and to an extension, South America.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.020]   And you start going through these.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.060]   So Canada, what does Canada offer?
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:03.420]   Well for young people who are highly educated, have some Canadian connections, et cetera,
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.980]   Canada offers a pathway to residency, pathway to citizenship that's very – can be pretty
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.180]   quick.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:14.660]   The challenge is that Canada wants people who are going to move there and live there.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.260]   There's no pathway to Canadian citizenship or Canadian residency that doesn't involve
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.200]   you spending months and months per year there.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.820]   So there's a huge investment of time.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:31.740]   Canada also suffers from very high taxes and very high cost of living.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.300]   Real estate prices are very high and overall high cost of living.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:41.260]   And so for Americans who look at that and say, "But I can do better in the United States,"
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.260]   Canada can be hard.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.500]   Unless you want to move there, have some connection there, et cetera, Canada can offer limited
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   options.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.140]   I always recommend Canada as a great first stop for banking.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.880]   It's one of the easiest places to go for an American and open another bank account.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.900]   But I don't want to get too much involved with Canada beyond that unless I actually
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.620]   want to go and live there and appreciate the lifestyle and gain from what you spend in
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.560]   tax money, et cetera.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.560]   What other nations are there?
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.620]   Well, there's Mexico.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.460]   Mexico offers world-class options.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.420]   Years ago, a number of years ago, I interviewed a Mexican attorney and the title of the show
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.340]   was "Why Every American Should Go and Establish a Residence Permit in Mexico."
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.500]   I still believe that.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.980]   Every single American should have a residence permit established in Mexico.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.460]   Prices have come up recently as they always do.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.620]   And Mexico is a place that you should have a residence permit.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.180]   There's a great second residency, a place that you can go and live.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.900]   It offers a pathway to citizenship that, while not the fastest in terms of calendar years,
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.040]   can be one of the fastest in the world in terms of days on the ground.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.220]   It's a great birth tourism destination.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:55.360]   One of my top three that I recommend for birth tourism, just a really, really great destination.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.340]   It's wonderful also for Americans because of the drivability.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.240]   However, Mexico has a number of disadvantages.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.920]   Some of the big ones involve finding a lifestyle that you like with an appropriate community.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.380]   People are often very worried, especially in the drug war areas of crime and violence
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.540]   that happens.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:18.460]   And a big challenge of Mexico is taxation, that Mexico offers very limited tax planning
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.460]   opportunities.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.220]   It's a high tax jurisdiction.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.780]   And so while, of course, there are millions of people living, not millions, excuse me,
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.420]   there are many people living there who just ignore the law.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.500]   If you want to do everything by the book, it can be difficult to get really low taxes
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.140]   or eliminate your taxes living in Mexico.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.740]   So I think Mexico is a great option, but it's a limited option.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.080]   It's one of those things that has certain benefits, but it's hard to see it offering
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.920]   the whole package.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   Where else do you go?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.820]   Well, the Bahamas is, I think, a really great destination.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:53.060]   The Bahamas has, first of all, liberal entry requirements for people who want to simply
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.260]   come as tourists.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.920]   It's a tax-free place, no income tax.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.420]   It's very accessible to the United States, very close, easy to get back and forth from
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.480]   Florida, et cetera.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.860]   Great pathway, residence permit, not really any pathway to citizenship, but you can get
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.840]   a residence permit by buying a house there.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.060]   But it's very small, and it's very difficult to see yourself being there all the time.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.380]   And I think with wealthy people, it's not something, you know, international planning
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.340]   is something where you shouldn't lead with money saving.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.360]   The reason you got wealthy was so you could live the way you wanted to live.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   So Bahamas is a good option.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.920]   There are some other options in the Caribbean, lots of Caribbean citizenships that you can
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.300]   purchase, et cetera.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.160]   But the Caribbean also has some significant disadvantages, good tax havens, et cetera.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.780]   But at the end of the day, you're living on an island, not super well connected and can
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.920]   be quite challenging, depending on, again, what nation we're talking about.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.720]   Big difference between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, even though the weather might be
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.620]   very similar.
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.620]   What else is close to home?
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.660]   Well, then you get into Central America.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.620]   And Central America is a unique set of countries.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:05.260]   So South of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.420]   Panama, I think I got them all.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:13.380]   And each one of these nations has a different set of benefits and a different set of disadvantages.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   Of these nations, Panama is, I think, probably for the vast majority of people, Panama should
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.460]   be at the very top of the list.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.720]   And there are a few reasons why.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.300]   One of the big benefits of Central America is the geography, especially for American-based
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.440]   people.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.460]   If you're in Panama City, you are on East Coast time.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:44.100]   You're an easy short flight away from really anywhere, especially on the East Coast.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.700]   With anywhere from about two and a half hours to five hours, you could have direct connections
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.100]   from Panama City to the entirety of the East Coast.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:59.780]   Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, all of the Washington DC, Baltimore, New York,
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:05.540]   both JFK and Newark, Boston, Montreal, Toronto, Chicago, etc.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.620]   And good connection to the rest of the country as well.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.380]   Direct flights to Denver, Houston, Austin, direct flights to Vegas, Los Angeles, San
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.660]   Francisco, etc.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:20.700]   Panama City is also the best connected of the Central American nations to other parts.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:27.260]   First directly connected to, I think, every country in South America.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.700]   Direct connection to the vast majority of countries in the Caribbean and to every country
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.260]   in Central America.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:41.020]   As well as direct flights to Madrid, Paris, Amsterdam, Istanbul, just direct flights across
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.500]   the ocean as well.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.740]   And so that connectivity is really, really useful.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:51.500]   And having the same time zone is really useful instead of constantly working in the middle
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   of the night, etc.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.540]   It's a really good connection.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:59.260]   Panama has aggressively courted outsiders and has offered them really, really smooth
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.420]   and simple options.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.540]   Panama has for years been one of the best second residency destinations where you can
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.700]   come and with a simplified process you can set up a second residency.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.100]   What that means is you can have a residence permit where at any time you can move to Panama
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.380]   and you can live there full time with no requirement to leave the country.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:23.740]   But importantly, this residency permit, unlike places like Canada, etc., doesn't require
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.860]   you to invest huge amounts of time on the ground.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.460]   You do need to come there fairly regularly, at least once every year or two.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.740]   I can't remember, once every couple of years you need to come to renew your permit.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.780]   But you don't have to be there for ten months a year.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.620]   So if you're thinking about, you know what, I'm just going to keep on living where I want
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.300]   to live but I'd like to have an option in my pocket, a second residency in another place
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:51.020]   that could work out for me if I ever wanted to go or ever needed to go somewhere else,
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.600]   Panama is a really great place for that.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.500]   And because they have such a well-developed infrastructure, the process is simple, straightforward,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.140]   relatively inexpensive.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.100]   You can get your residency, get a driver's license, get everything squared away in a
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.740]   fairly short amount of time.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.460]   Panama is also one of the better destinations in Central America where you can live because
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.100]   of the lifestyle that it offers.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:20.820]   Unlike some other countries that seem rooted in the past and suffer with decay and not
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.380]   a lot of development, Panama is a nation that has actively embraced development.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.540]   If you go to Panama City, it's just a wonderful city.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.300]   And you can see that just driving along the waterfront and see the office towers, see
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.740]   the development, etc.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:41.780]   Panama is a financial hub of the world with many businesses based there of all kinds,
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.180]   huge banking jurisdiction, financial management jurisdiction, and they've gotten there that
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.940]   way because of their low tax rates.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:54.860]   Panama is a place where you can live either at a very low tax rate or with non-existent
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:55.860]   taxes, completely legally.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.140]   It's a territorial tax nation and there are a variety of ways that you can set up your
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:05.700]   finances and live tax-free or very tax-light depending on what you are looking for.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.780]   Panama has been a great place just even for lifestyle.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.580]   One of the things I still remember, the first time I went to Panama and traveled along the
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.540]   Panama Canal Zone, and I was just amazed at how American it felt.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.620]   Now the whole country is not like this, it's not Little America, but the Panama Canal Zone,
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.540]   that zone of the country that was owned by and operated by the Americans for a hundred
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:35.020]   years after the construction of the canal, it's amazing because all the architecture,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.220]   it feels like you're in 1950s America, 1970s America.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.420]   Some of that is now starting to be updated, but it's just a really interesting feel.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.720]   It's a very Western feeling place.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.060]   High rates of English spoken and the Spanish that's spoken is of generally high quality,
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:55.860]   a lot easier than Dominican Republic to learn and practice Spanish.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:02.980]   Panama has been a useful destination for even things, again I mentioned banking, gold storage,
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   etc.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.900]   It's just been, it's a good overall scenario.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.420]   It's one of the most livable places with one of the least costs of any of the options that
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.540]   are there in Central America.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.500]   And so it's a really useful tool in a planner's tool belt.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.700]   And because of its proximity to the United States, I think it has advantages over many
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.700]   of the other jurisdictions.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:33.180]   If we go to South America, right, the next significantly set of, the next place that
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.460]   has good options for internationalization, then again we run into certain places are
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.180]   good for some things and not for most things.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.260]   Colombia, I think, has a great future.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   I love Colombia.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.300]   Colombia is not a tax haven.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.380]   It's very hard to spend a lot, you can't spend all year in Colombia and pay zero taxes.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.860]   That's a challenge.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:57.940]   Go throughout South America, you go down to Southern South America and there are, each
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.460]   country has certain things that it's good at, but now you get into distance from the
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:08.460]   United States, cost of going back and forth goes up, and there aren't a ton of great tax
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.260]   savings opportunities in some of those nations.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.100]   There are good residency options.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.780]   Paraguay, Argentina has a pathway to citizenship, but then there's also a huge amount of instability.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.060]   And Panama has several decades of good stability and a great, good government in force right
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.060]   now.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.260]   So I'll stop going on about Panama.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:30.700]   What I'm trying to demonstrate to you, however, in my own comments, and I'm speaking fairly
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:37.100]   extemporaneously off the cuff here, is simply that each nation has something to offer, but
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:42.580]   it's hard to find most things or everything in one country.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:49.940]   But if you have a base in the United States or you are around the United States, Panama
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:55.020]   is one of those options that offers more things than others.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:02.260]   And so, again, even just the tax efficiency, the lifestyle, the conveniences, etc., Panama
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.460]   has a much, if you go down the list of ten different factors, Panama will punch eight
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.700]   of them, whereas some of the other nations in Central America, Northern South America,
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.680]   and North America will punch, say, five or six of them.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.780]   And so it's a leading country in that regard.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:28.140]   So if any of this is interesting to you, then now we turn to the event that we are hosting.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.500]   So the event that I am hosting is in January.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.900]   The specific dates will be January 22 to January 28.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.460]   So that's the fourth week of January 2024.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.500]   January 22 to January 28.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.780]   It will be a seven-day, six-night trip in Panama.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:52.300]   And basically, it's not all-inclusive, but it's close to all-inclusive.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:58.580]   All of the planning has been done for you, and it's going to be an overview of Panama.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.620]   It's going to be a chance for you to travel, see some sites, take a look at, do some investment
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.940]   tours, look at some different things.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:11.780]   And it's going to be based in Panama City, Anton Valley, the highlands, etc.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:17.020]   And there's going to be a combination of activities put together.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.980]   First is going to be an educational opportunity.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.980]   I'll be speaking.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.340]   I have a couple of sessions planned.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.780]   Mikkel Thorup will be speaking.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:30.020]   By the way, I had Mikkel on the show some time back as an interviewee.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.940]   And you can go and listen to that episode of the podcast with him.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.420]   I first got to know Mikkel several years ago when I read his book.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:43.940]   When I was back in that early phase of my internationalization education, I went out
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.460]   and I read as many different books on the subjects as I could find.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.820]   And one of those that I read was Mikkel's book, "Expat Money."
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.980]   Mikkel is a super interesting and extremely knowledgeable guy.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:58.580]   He emigrated from Canada when he was in his teens, and he has traveled all over the world.
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.400]   He's lived in a variety of nations.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.060]   Most recently, before he moved to Panama some years ago, I think he was living in Abu Dhabi
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.060]   with his wife.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.340]   And actually, interestingly, I was just recently with him and I asked him why he moved from
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.700]   Abu Dhabi to Panama.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.740]   And his reasons I thought were very, very interesting and be reflective of some of the
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:23.480]   things that I said about Panama being such a useful jurisdiction.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.820]   Super interesting commentary that I'm sure you can ask him about yourself.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.260]   And so on this tour, Mikkel is going to be teaching and presenting.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.420]   I think some of his contacts are also going to be presenting a few different sessions.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:41.140]   I'll be presenting and teaching, and then Gabriel Custodiate will also be presenting
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.620]   and teaching.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.980]   But this trip is going to be very intimate, meaning hanging out.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.740]   The maximum number of attendees is 40 people.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.740]   That's it.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.780]   So once we get to 40, it's done.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.300]   It'll be no more than 40.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.940]   And given the fact that we're going to be spending time together in a number of different
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:02.420]   contexts, it's going to be a great opportunity for you to spend time with me, with Mikkel,
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.420]   with Gabriel.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.500]   We're going to be traveling together, spending significant amounts of time together, and
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.100]   especially by capping it at no more than 40 people.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:14.540]   I expect it to be us to have lots of time to spend together.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.180]   And we're not only going to be in Panama City.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.660]   We'll do a real estate tour of Panama City.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.540]   We're going to do a tour of an offshore gold vault in the Panama Free Trade Zone.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.060]   We'll visit the Panama Canal, of course.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.300]   You can't go to Panama and not visit the canal.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.380]   We'll go and visit the highlands and see a self-sustaining community that Mikkel is a
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.380]   partner in.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.340]   We'll have all kinds of events together over the course of those seven days.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.920]   The full itinerary is listed at expatmoney.com/radical.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.740]   You can read the itinerary and see everything that is included.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.940]   In fact, let me go over what's included.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.980]   First thing that's included, your hotel, six nights of accommodation at a high quality
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.900]   hotel in Panama.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.100]   Breakfast will be included every day as well.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.740]   We'll have a welcome dinner and wine together at a very nice restaurant on day of your arrival.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.220]   We'll have three days of conferences together.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.140]   At those conferences, it'll include, of course, refreshments.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.340]   It includes a private real estate tour with all transportation included.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.460]   Sunset cocktails on Ocean Reef Islands, tour of the Panama Canal, entry fee is included.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.780]   Gold vault tour, transportation included.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:28.460]   Afternoon spent in Casco Viejo, which is the historic district of downtown Panama City.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:33.340]   Field trip to Anton Valley to visit the site of the upcoming self-sustaining community.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.500]   Real estate on the Pacific Ocean, tour of the facilities, party on a private beach including
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.740]   food beverages, live music and transportation there and back.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:48.580]   The vast majority of your costs and the vast majority of your experiences will be included.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:53.780]   What's not included will be any lunches or dinners that I didn't mention.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.740]   A handful of lunches and dinners, snacks, water, souvenirs, travel insurance, any activities
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:03.180]   that you want to do that aren't included in the itinerary, as well as your transportation
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:11.340]   to and from the airport into Panama City and then airline flights to and from Panama.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.220]   The great news about that is airline flights are generally pretty inexpensive in and out
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.500]   of Panama and there's a metro that goes directly.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.180]   If you want to ride the metro, it goes directly from the airport into the city or, of course,
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.940]   there's private transportation available as well.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.980]   It's going to be a really, really great event.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:36.080]   What I'm most looking forward to myself is the chance to spend time with listeners.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.460]   One of the reasons I'm doing this is to spend time.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.940]   I have a financial incentive, of course, on this tour, etc.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.700]   I'll go over the prices in just a second.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.660]   So obviously, I have a financial incentive.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:55.180]   But one of the things that I most want to do is I really want to do a lot more interaction
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.660]   with you, my listeners.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:05.900]   I desire very much to bring a much, much more in-person connections to this community.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.180]   I have a few ways that I've been intending to do that.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:11.860]   Number one, I'm intending to do more simple meetups.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.820]   I may be able to do more this summer.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.100]   The problem is right now, I've got so many little children that it's incredibly burdensome
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.180]   on my wife for me to be away.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:26.980]   So I have a choice of either I hit the road and I put a significant burden on her, which
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.420]   – by the way, she doesn't complain.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.860]   She doesn't say I can't do anything.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   But I love my wife.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   I don't want to overburden her.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.980]   It's just tough.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.420]   If I'm gone for weeks at a time, that's really difficult.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.220]   And so I want to do more meetups.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.460]   It's just difficult right now to be away for significant amounts of time.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.700]   I want to do some more camps and things like that.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.420]   I have a friend and a listener that I'm going to start working on and organizing some
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:56.620]   family camps because I really want to bring more of a sense of community, of in-person
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.620]   community.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.140]   We're all dying for friendships and community, et cetera.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.700]   I really want to – I love being with listeners because we're like-minded in many things.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.540]   We have something in common and that leads to good relationships.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:13.140]   So I want to do more family camps and more educational stuff in years to come.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.220]   I want to do more seminars.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:20.300]   In my files, I have multiple three-day seminars where I could teach through things in a systematic
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.580]   way, et cetera.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.460]   But I haven't figured out for myself, "Okay, what's the price point?
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:29.420]   What's the – Am I selling a $200 seminar or a $20,000 seminar and the marketing and
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.020]   all of that, et cetera?"
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.940]   And so one of the reasons I partnered with Mikkel is that he's got a team that does
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.100]   this.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:43.060]   He's got a great setup where he does these tours himself for his audience.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.820]   Basically they've got experience with it.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:50.020]   So I'm working with him because I get to – His team does everything.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.540]   They make all the hotel reservations.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.540]   They make everything.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.660]   They do all the logistics.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.660]   I show up.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.780]   I hang out with y'all, which is going to be pretty cool.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.780]   I show up.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.780]   I hang out with you guys.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.820]   I don't have to deal with any of the administrative stuff, but I also get to see how it goes,
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.500]   how it works, what works well for us.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:14.820]   So if you just imagine hanging out for a week with me, with Gabriel, with Mikkel, and with
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:19.740]   39 other listeners of the show where you have something in common, it's going to be a
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.620]   phenomenal week where we're just going to – I mean we can talk about everything.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.660]   And I promise you I'm leaving my family at home.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.940]   So for this event it'll just be me and from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. I'll be around.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.260]   I'll be available.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:40.220]   And you'll get a chance to – We'll get to know each other very, very well.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.260]   And so that's what I'm super excited about.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:48.780]   It's just to spend time and company with 40 of my listeners and Gabriel's listeners,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.780]   et cetera.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.780]   We're all going to have a lot in common.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.780]   We're going to be great.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.860]   It's going to be a great networking opportunity, not just with the Panamanian Connections,
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.860]   but just among us.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:01.060]   I'm sure we're going to forge and deepen some connections and relationships and friendships
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.780]   that may go far beyond where we are.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:11.860]   So in case it's not evident, this is not going to be a family-friendly event, meaning
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.980]   we're not going to be doing anything that's not family-friendly, but other than sitting
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.660]   around and listening to – thinking about international tax planning.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.060]   But it's not an event for children.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:27.620]   So my troop of five young children under the age of 10, they will all be at home, not with
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.620]   me.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.180]   So I think – what's it?
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.500]   We said 13 and up.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.740]   If you want to bring your children, they just need to be older than 13, something like that.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.620]   But this is going to be an adult's event.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.940]   And so that's going to give us time to be together with minimal work, minimal hassle,
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   et cetera.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.260]   And that's going to be awesome.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:52.640]   Prices for one individual, the price for all of that is $3,900.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.620]   So that covers the bulk of your expenses there in Panama City.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:02.740]   You got to get yourself to and from Panama and then cover a handful of meals and whatever
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.500]   other activities you want that aren't there.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:14.500]   And so figure probably all in, if our price is $3,900, then your budget probably $5,000.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.980]   We should be very comfortable depending on where you're flying from.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.460]   If you're flying in from Taipei, then you deal with your airfare.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:26.100]   But somewhere between $4,000, $4,500 all in, you'll be there.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.820]   So $3,900 for a single occupancy room.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.620]   If you want to come and bring your spouse, that is of course welcome.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:39.420]   For a double occupancy room, then the price goes down to $2,900 per person.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.620]   $2,900 per person for a double occupancy room.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.020]   So those are the prices.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.940]   More details, if you have any questions, you can ask me.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.280]   If you go to expatmoney.com/radical, that's where you sign up.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.920]   All the details are there on the sales page.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:03.040]   You can hear on that sales page, you can hear Mikkel talk about how to move to Panama or
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.340]   use it as your plan B residency.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.540]   And so that's a great introduction to Panama.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:12.500]   And by the way, this event is a Panama tour.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.460]   However, Mikkel does global planning.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.980]   And in the same way that I'm not shying away, I'm not trying to convince you that Panama
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   is the best thing.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.660]   I'm talking about, and I will talk there at the event, we'll talk about all the different
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.620]   countries that you're interested in.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.820]   Mikkel does planning all over the world for clients, private planning, et cetera.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:37.240]   He and his wife have a really interesting story and they've done all the stuff.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.460]   And so this is not only about Panama.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.780]   So if you have questions and you want to work on Mexican residency or something in Canada,
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.700]   Mikkel's from Canada, doesn't like Canada, probably disagrees with my telling you to
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.500]   go and get a bank account there.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.700]   But hey, that's welcome to the world of internationalization.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.500]   He does these tours and has done them with his audience and the Channel Islands and
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.660]   a number of different places around the world.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.900]   And he's lived in many places, et cetera.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:10.180]   And so while this is a Panama event, don't think that you are committing yourself in
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.180]   coming.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.580]   Don't think that you're committing yourself that I've got to do Panama stuff.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.820]   I think Panama stuff is a great option for a lot of people.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.640]   And this is going to get you a chance to know Panama, to understand what's great about Panama,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.700]   see it with yourself, enjoy a week away.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.420]   We put it during the winter, you'll notice.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:31.260]   So this will be January and Panama will not be cold and snowy.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.620]   Panama will be warm and tropical.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.300]   And so if you want to get away in January, get away with your spouse, we'd love to
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.700]   welcome you for a time together.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:45.400]   And obviously you put on as much time at the beginning or the end as you want to, to take
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.060]   advantage of other aspects of being in Panama.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.860]   But we're going to make it worth your time and look forward to hanging out.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:59.740]   So at expatmoney.com/radical, you can listen to Mikkel's podcast on Panama and then we'll
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.920]   talk about other stuff.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.260]   The event is an event in and of itself.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.980]   And we've got a lecture schedule that's planned on some specific topics where we're
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:14.940]   going to give you overviews of this on a truly international place.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.500]   But we're in Panama and we're going to go and see what the opportunities are in Panama.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.500]   So I think that's it.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.740]   That's everything I'd like to talk to you about.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.020]   I hope that you will come.

[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:41.980]   We will do the trip if we get, we have a minimum number and I don't think we're going to have
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.940]   any trouble hitting it, but I think we're going to sell out.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.300]   I'm pretty confident.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.820]   I mean, I haven't done a ton of these, but I'm pretty confident from what I have done
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.620]   that we'll have no trouble selling out.
