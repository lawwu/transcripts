[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   - I have anal beads that are communicating
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.880]   with stock fish via Bluetooth.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.720]   We'll get to that.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.780]   - If you cheat, you play God.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.400]   You decide when the game is over.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.000]   You can fake bad moves.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.200]   You can fake everything.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.080]   You can even, if you're cheating, quote unquote,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.720]   the right way, you're gonna lose plenty of games.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.080]   To avoid getting detected.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.260]   - What's the probability that Hans cheated
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.680]   over the board against Magnus in St. Louis?
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.680]   - I think day by day, the evidence is slowly starting
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.240]   to show more and more that he's cheated,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.920]   like how Magnus said, more than he said and more recently.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.280]   - The following is a conversation with Levi Rosman,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.800]   also known as Gotham Chess.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   He's a professional chess player and educator.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.200]   I highly recommend you check out his YouTube channel
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.160]   called Gotham Chess.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.480]   in the description.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.700]   And now, dear friends, here's Levi Rosman.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.160]   You're known for being able to guess people's ELO rating.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.000]   So what do you think?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.340]   Just by looking at my face, deep into my eyes,
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.440]   what's my ELO rating?
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.360]   Here, I'll help you.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.480]   I'll do E4 for the listener.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.760]   I actually read that stock fish prefers E4.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.400]   - Does it really?
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.480]   I actually didn't know that.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.120]   - Because it maximizes the number of tactical options.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.360]   So-- - That makes sense.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.700]   - The right answer is 3,400, which is, I believe, stock fish.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.840]   You guess people's ELO chess rating.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.960]   What's that take?
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.080]   How hard is it to do that?
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.000]   And how would you actually do that?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.560]   Like what are telltale signs or red flags
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.880]   about a person at different ratings?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.000]   Is there something you look for?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.960]   - Yeah, I think you can separate it something like
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   the very first, the zero to about 8,900.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.240]   For simplicity's sake,
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   I'm gonna use the chess.com rating system
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.760]   because LeeChess is slightly different.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.800]   It tends to go two, 300 points higher than chess.com,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.060]   sometimes even four, 500 points higher.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.960]   But then it catches up.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   They catch up around 22, 2,300, I would say.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.320]   - What's chess.com?
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.040]   What's LeeChess?
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.600]   Can you like-- - Yeah, so--
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.880]   - Explain what the difference is and what they are?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.520]   - They're two chess websites.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.280]   - Good starting point.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.800]   - Yes, chess.com is,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.200]   it has obviously the free option where you can play games.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.480]   You get some sort of puzzles every single day.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.580]   You get some sort of lessons every single day.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.600]   But then they have tiered memberships
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.560]   where you can pay annually or per month
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.240]   that you can unlock all the other features.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.720]   And-- - Like what?
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.440]   Like for training, for like-- - For training.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.280]   - Puzzles and all that kind of stuff?
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.540]   - Yeah, they have unlimited puzzles,
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.380]   but they also have,
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.080]   their biggest selling point for sure
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.040]   is like a dedicated game review
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.080]   that it's like very flashy and sophisticated
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.120]   and the coach will literally tell you what you did wrong
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.360]   every single moment the computer evaluated a mistake.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.080]   But the most important thing that they have
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.880]   is they offer international masters, grandmasters,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.000]   the opportunity to make video lesson libraries,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.320]   which hundreds of hours of anything.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.160]   I can even learn some stuff on there probably.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.300]   - I have anal beads that are communicating
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.920]   with stock fish via Bluetooth.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.880]   - Yeah, we've-- - We'll get to that.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.320]   - Yes, we will get to that.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's epic.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.440]   It's actually scary how many people think
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.520]   that's a real thing, by the way,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.920]   which is the danger of the internet.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.720]   But yeah, we will get into that.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.080]   - I tend to believe that people believing a thing
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.920]   that's hilarious at scale will make that thing a reality.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.480]   I'm with Elon on this.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.700]   I think people manifest the meme, the meme becomes real.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.800]   So that, but that's in all walks of life.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.280]   I think there is something about humor sort of being,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   ugh, why did I, I was gonna, what was I was going to say
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   is I feel like humor becomes a lubricant
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.360]   for the trajectory of human civilization,
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.520]   and I don't know why the word lubricant went into my head,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.760]   which-- - Beads?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.360]   - I understand, but it's very Freudian.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   Anyway, so zero to 900, if you're a 1300 player,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.680]   you were saying? - Yeah.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.060]   If you're not good at end games,
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.080]   you don't understand how to convert positions
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.500]   that have seven or eight pieces left on the board.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.680]   You don't know when you're supposed to activate your king.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.800]   You don't know how a bishop outplays a knight
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.280]   with just several pawns on the board.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.680]   Those are all very important things
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.340]   because it's not just about knowing
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.280]   the theoretical end games.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.920]   Like some positions in chess are literally solved.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.000]   If I showed you a position, I asked,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820]   "What's the evaluation and how do you win it?"
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.120]   There's a technique, you're supposed to know that technique.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.540]   - And the coaches on chess.com can help or no?
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.140]   - Yeah, so these lesson libraries,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.200]   it's not like a live lesson,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.320]   it's prerecorded training position, walk you through it.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.900]   And then there's a dynamic factor as well
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.300]   where you can practice.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.560]   You can practice the theoretical
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.420]   and you can practice a practical game
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.280]   where there's no set format to do something.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.800]   It's just based on your previous experience.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   Basically, Lichess is their entire thing
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.480]   is it's an open source website
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.560]   that tries to be as free as possible
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.460]   and operates totally on donations.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.680]   They don't have any advertisements.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.480]   They don't have, which is weird
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.360]   because normally in big competitive settings,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.320]   it's all capitalistic.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.520]   You have one big entity and another big entity
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.420]   and they're both for profit.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.200]   But in this case, the big argument is,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.300]   well, they offer a lot of things for free.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.240]   You can analyze your games for free.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.960]   You can go into Lichess's lessons library
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.560]   and do things for free.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   The comparison that I always make is chess.com
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.040]   is basically like having a good personal trainer
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.720]   and having someone to help you at the gym.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.520]   Lichess says you have to do all the stuff yourself.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.840]   So you can combine YouTube with Lichess.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.520]   No one's gonna really point you in the right direction.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.840]   You gotta go fully explore on your own.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.260]   If you wanna do it, you can.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.960]   I also like to say, can I make a controversial joke?
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.920]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.460]   Ardent Lichess supporters are like very angry,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.880]   only vegetarian or vegan folks
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.840]   because they will tear you apart
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.360]   and try to convert you as much as possible.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.600]   - Did you just point a large number of haters
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   onto this very podcast?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.760]   Is this what just happened? - No.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.040]   - Is there like several people
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.920]   that were very upset at you right now?
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   - No. - And throwing things?
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.740]   Okay. - No, no.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.720]   That's always the joke that I've made
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.920]   because if people have chess.com,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.880]   and I love all people, but I'm just saying,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   chess.com patrons do not try to actively convert
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.740]   folks on Lichess.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.060]   Folks on Lichess are like, there's a meme chess.com.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.640]   Chess.com. - Oh, it started at Lichess.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.340]   - Started somewhere on Reddit, Anarchy Chess, kind of a--
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.700]   - Oh, so Lichess is a little bit
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.800]   of an anarchist organization.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.300]   Would you go as far as to say
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.480]   they're a terrorist extremist organization?
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.300]   Are we going there?
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.460]   - For legal reasons, that's a...
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.660]   I thought Lichess has really good analysis.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   Somebody, does it have an engine for analysis
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.660]   of games, or is that an open source thing that--
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.060]   - They both do, they both use Stockfish 15.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.300]   - Okay, and then the rest is the interface
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.820]   around Stockfish that shows--
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.860]   - It's tough, it's the live,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.620]   so chess has a live server where you and I
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.700]   can play a game against each other.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.140]   We just both seek, and if we have the same rating,
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.420]   we have the same criteria, we'll play a game.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.940]   But there's also reviewing your own games.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.500]   There's an opening database,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.920]   so you can see what the most popular trends are.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.700]   So Lichess is great.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.620]   I'm sponsored by chess.com, and I will openly say that,
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.300]   but you can't have--
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.980]   - So you're deeply biased?
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.060]   - Yes.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.620]   But I'm also complimenting the competitor.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.060]   - Can you play games on Lichess,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.900]   or is it just for analysis?
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.740]   - Yeah, yeah, you can.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.060]   - So it's the same exact thing.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.220]   So they're legitimately competitors.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.260]   Not exactly the same thing, but they have the...
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.620]   They're trying to match for features,
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.060]   but you're saying Lichess is more chaotic,
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.540]   and then chess.com is more professional?
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.460]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.480]   I don't know if it's chaotic.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.980]   I just know that it's...
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.900]   You have to...
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.420]   No one's gonna hold your hand if you go to Lichess.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.260]   You absolutely can.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.120]   You can play games, you can analyze your games,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.460]   but you have to discover it yourself.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.700]   The whole point of chess.com is to make the journey
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.940]   as simple as possible.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.220]   But I also firmly believe you can't have any sort of growth
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.660]   in chess without a chess.com or a chess24.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.300]   - What's chess24?
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.820]   - So chess24 was another live server
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.620]   with some lesson libraries and so on,
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.540]   but they were, I think the process was,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.140]   they were bought by PlayMagnus.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.940]   So...
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.760]   - What's PlayMagnus?
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.100]   - PlayMagnus is...
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.740]   - That's Magnus Carlsen's thing.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.580]   - He doesn't own it.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.980]   He owns some stake in it, I think nine or 10%.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.180]   They owned a bunch of chess companies, including chess24,
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.140]   but now it seems like they're either merging
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.940]   or basically getting acquired by chess.com.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.780]   - Got it.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.460]   And then PlayMagnus, it's an app also
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.500]   where you can play magic at different levels,
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.940]   but there's also the educational stuff.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.780]   - Yes.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.600]   - Okay.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.980]   - The for-profit chess companies make the option
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.460]   for grandmasters to make a living to make chess in eSport.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.300]   Yeah, Lichess is great.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.700]   It doesn't put on any events.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.580]   There's no commentary.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.300]   So you can have both in theory
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.340]   and probably some controversy is good.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.580]   - Does chess.com like sponsor you?
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.540]   They help you out in some way?
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.300]   Like what's the connection between your videos
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.860]   and streams and so on in chess.com?
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.860]   Like are they supporting people in that way or no?
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.580]   - My content, they don't necessarily,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.860]   I just make whatever I want.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.420]   Like I don't have, I've not sensed,
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.540]   like if they do something stupid,
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.420]   I will call out their leadership.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.580]   It's not like, but I, to have the logo up,
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.220]   like in my YouTube videos or on my, yeah, that's just.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.060]   - That kind of stuff.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.880]   - Yeah.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.900]   - So anyway, back to, I mean, that was really helpful.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.340]   I was confused about all of that.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.380]   - No, it's.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.460]   - The guessing people's rating.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.300]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.100]   - So the thing you mentioned about the end game,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.260]   if you don't know what the hell you're doing
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.540]   with the end game, what does that mean about your rating?
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.660]   If you don't know how to finish
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.860]   with just a few pieces on the board.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.220]   - You could be my rating.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.700]   (laughing)
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.660]   End game is tough.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.420]   - That's the self-deprecating humor we tuned in for.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.980]   - End games are hard, man.
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.820]   They're tough.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.660]   - So they're very difficult.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.980]   - Yeah, you can't have, there's a reason Magnus is the best.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.780]   It's because seven hours into a game
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.940]   when everybody's given up,
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.740]   he's still squeezing juice out of the fruit.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.660]   So that's the way I would describe it.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.820]   - So that's not a good source of information if you.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.700]   - No, within the first 15 moves, generally you can tell.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.180]   Because you can tell how well they played the opening.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.860]   So how well they knew what they were supposed to memorize,
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.100]   what they were supposed to play,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.460]   and then how they react to piece interactions.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.180]   So if they are faced with a move
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.900]   that a more advanced player would deal with very swiftly
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.620]   because there's kind of a natural response,
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.860]   that gives you information.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.980]   If they move their king when they're in check
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.420]   when they didn't have to, that's a massive giveaway.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.780]   Some people just think, oh, I'm in check
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.020]   so I have to move my king.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.180]   - Okay, so it's like how direct the response
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.500]   of your play is to the danger.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.500]   So if you're more moving multiple pieces at a time,
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.780]   meaning you're moving, the pieces are tied together
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.900]   in interesting ways.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.740]   Okay, okay.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.620]   What about the opening, can you tell also?
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.260]   Because a lot of people can memorize openings, right?
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.780]   - Yeah, but it takes two to tango.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.180]   So you could memorize a bunch of stuff,
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.020]   but if you're 900 and I'm 900,
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.620]   my rating is fluctuating all over the place
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.100]   in this podcast, I feel like.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.500]   12, 13, 900.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.740]   You can memorize things, I'm gonna play some crap
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.860]   and you can't play the way you memorize them
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.780]   because I have to respond to you in certain ways.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.500]   So you will either respond the way you think
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.620]   you're supposed to respond
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.000]   and that will probably be incorrect,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.020]   or now you have to figure out how to deal
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.020]   with the fresh position.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.180]   - Oh, so the 900 will reflect itself in both cases.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.060]   - I wonder if actually, so do you know your current rating
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.540]   or no, or your top rating?
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.500]   What was your top?
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.700]   - I know both my current ELO, like over the board,
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.660]   now is 2320, my peak was 2430.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.500]   - Oh, cool.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.100]   So can you play like a 900 player?
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.380]   Like can you force yourself?
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.220]   - Yeah.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.220]   - So you can like, given that you've guessed
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.220]   a lot of ELO ratings, can you kind of emulate that?
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.940]   It's kind of an interesting question for me.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.780]   - Yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.620]   Before I was doing YouTube and Twitch,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.460]   I was teaching kids.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.540]   So I had to, not only did I have to play at their rating,
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   I also had to play and sometimes even behave
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.220]   and explain things in a way that a kid could understand.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.180]   So absolutely, yeah, I think that's what contributed
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.000]   to the growth of the channel, frankly.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.560]   I kind of understood how beginners thought about the game.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.460]   - So yeah, you did, you taught people chess,
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.700]   you coached people for many years, I guess in New York.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.860]   - Yeah, New York.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.860]   - What did you learn about the way people learn from that?
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.740]   So like how did people that were successful
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.460]   at getting good at chess quickly,
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.540]   what were some of the commonalities,
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.860]   some of the patterns that you saw?
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.800]   - Obsession.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.300]   - What does obsession look like?
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:39.260]   - I would say it's obsession and also love of the game.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.640]   So if you're bored, you don't wanna watch a show,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.660]   you wanna boot up chess.com or LeeChess,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.580]   just so I don't get flamed by anyone in the audience.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.380]   - So you're saying LeeChess people
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.220]   are the ones that would attack aggressively?
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.060]   They're the kind of people--
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.940]   - It's probably the Chess24 people.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.780]   - Oh, that's another--
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.100]   (laughing)
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.300]   I didn't know, I thought Chess24 was part of the chess.com--
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.140]   - Well, now, yes.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.020]   - A cult or tribe or whatever terms you wanna use.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.040]   - I'm sure there's even more places to play live.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.000]   There always have been more places to play live,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.860]   but Chess.com, LeeChess, Dominate,
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.140]   and well, Chess24 is rough for live interface.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.140]   Of course, they have good courses and everything, but--
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.980]   - Yeah, I get it, I get it.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.900]   And some are even good people or whatever
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.340]   that quote goes.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:33.340]   Okay, like obsession, that means the way
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.220]   they look at the board, when they're bored,
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.100]   how quickly do they return to the chess board,
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.300]   that kind of stuff.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.940]   - Just like how many hours a day they want to spend.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.780]   - Yes.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.620]   - They spend and want to spend.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.780]   - Some kids definitely have a talent.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.220]   Of course, there's this eternal debate,
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.640]   talent versus hard work.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.540]   I don't necessarily know if it's a talent
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.480]   for chess specifically, but it's a talent for,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.180]   I'm sure there's some sort of spatial visualization
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.860]   in your mind, you start picking up what squares
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.460]   are controlled by your pieces
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.540]   and opponent's pieces faster,
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.980]   your memory is much stronger.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.760]   So you don't just learn openings, like we discussed,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.980]   you learn literal patterns such as,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.380]   oh, I remember this from two tournaments ago.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.220]   I remember this from a game I played just yesterday.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.980]   And you just keep playing and playing and playing.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.200]   But I think the one commonality,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.820]   I think I've seen in all kids,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.100]   it's obsession, you have to play a lot.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.260]   And I've seen kids who are brilliant kids,
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.580]   like if you give them a page of tactics, puzzles,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.340]   they solve faster than anybody.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.900]   They can pick things up here super fast.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.460]   They're a pleasure to teach.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.100]   They go to a tournament, disaster.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.020]   They can't handle the anxiousness.
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.020]   They can't handle that silent face-to-face war
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.400]   with another six-year-old.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.420]   They can't even handle, there's also trash talk.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.420]   One sentence by a kid can throw off your prize student.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.380]   And I've seen kids just totally disintegrate.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.380]   I've seen also my students bully other kids,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.980]   according to my student wasn't that strong,
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.260]   but their verbal warfare, which is not allowed,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.740]   but goes unnoticed.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.220]   - But it's not even verbal warfare,
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.420]   like just going like, hmm.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.380]   Like little like facial expressions you make at the board.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.860]   Yeah, I didn't even think about that.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.620]   That's pretty creepy, the intensity, not creepy,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.480]   that's not the right word,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.920]   but there's an intensity in that silence over the board.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.400]   Like you can probably hear stuff,
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.880]   like just like, it's super quiet.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's like a library.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.840]   - Yep.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.400]   - And then there's just a tension that builds.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.240]   You can hear the breathing.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.680]   - Yeah, and at the highest level,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.320]   both sides are involved in a battle
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.800]   that they both foresee 99% of the time.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.860]   That's the scary part,
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.520]   is that you both see the exact same thing.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.120]   It's very rare you play a move and I didn't see it.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.200]   It's that I mis-evaluated it.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   I saw the move could be played,
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.400]   but I missed something three or four moves deeper.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.480]   You play that move and suddenly you're excited
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.120]   and I'm nervous, but all of a sudden,
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.920]   you make an inaccuracy and now the tide shifts, right?
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.800]   We could be on totally different planes throughout the game
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.280]   or we could be on the same plane throughout the game.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.120]   So it's really fascinating.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.880]   - Yeah, so your thought is when you see a move
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.680]   that to you seems suboptimal and you start to think,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.360]   what was that?
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.760]   You start to try to make sense of that.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.540]   Did you miscalculate or did they miscalculate?
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.320]   Isn't that what Magnus is really good at,
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.680]   is taking people away from, making suboptimal moves,
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.680]   to take them away from the known openings,
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.320]   or is that unfair to say?
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   - Yeah, he gets part of his really dominant reputation,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.800]   I think, from not letting people get
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   into ultra theoretical positions.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.560]   He just won this tournament, this online tournament,
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.680]   and he said he had a young player strategy.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.920]   He had an anti, sorry, a anti young player strategy.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.760]   - What's that mean?
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.920]   - It means that by move seven or eight,
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.360]   you go to the database, no games.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.240]   Kid is on their own, they have to swim on their own.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.840]   And they have to deal with the strategic complexities
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.640]   of the position, which he just, he gets.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.960]   And he might get from just an enormous database
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.840]   within his brain of historical games
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.200]   that have similar structures, or just sheer genius.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.840]   Like we won't know.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.560]   It's a mix of the two, for sure.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.480]   The younger you are, you can't remember a game played
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.240]   in 1951 in some bar in the Soviet Union, but he does.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.640]   'Cause he read a book once, or a magazine once.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.480]   - And he just remembers it.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.040]   - He just remembers, and he remembers the structure,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.760]   which it's just, it's not fair.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.600]   It's crazy, right?
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.880]   - What do you think makes him,
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.960]   if we can sort of link on it,
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.720]   what do you think makes him so good?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.360]   - I think it's the memory, and I think it's,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:06.120]   he just seems to get the game better than anybody else.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.360]   That's the best way I can describe it.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   In sports, you have reaction time, you have strength,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   you have, but also as he's now evolving, it's stamina.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.200]   So there have been games that if you put two other
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.880]   27, 50 rated players, or world top 10 players,
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.160]   they would have drawn the game.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.320]   The game would have ended, the game,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.240]   nobody would have won it.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.680]   You put Magnus as one of the aggressors in that game,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.080]   suddenly the chance of victory doubles from 5% to 10%.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.960]   - What's that about?
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.720]   'Cause what is it, game six against Netball League?
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   - Right.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.560]   - Isn't Stockfish say that it's supposed to be a draw?
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.720]   - So 0.00 does mean a draw sometimes,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.120]   but other times it means,
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.200]   and this is the joke I always make,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.560]   it means that Stockfish is out for a smoke break.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.400]   It just, it can't-
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.920]   - Can you explain the joke, and can you explain 0.00?
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.680]   - Yes, so when, so Stockfish will show an evaluation,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.580]   which determines whether the position is equal,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.680]   slightly better for one side,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.080]   slightly better for the other side, or completely winning.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.480]   You can, 0.00, 0.2, minus 0.2,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.580]   that's all within a balance.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.960]   You can say, okay, black has a little sprinkle of activity,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.860]   something, white has that, but if it's 0.00,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.480]   it could be literally a dead draw,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.360]   meaning theoretically just impossible to win,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   but oftentimes what that means is,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.760]   the smoke break joke is, Stockfish doesn't know.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.320]   There is so much complexity within the position,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.960]   the combinations of different moves
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.140]   that are acceptable and okay, it cannot evaluate correctly.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.960]   - Wow, so even the end games are tough for Stockfish.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.820]   - Which is why Magnus won that game,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.440]   because there was practical value remaining.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.760]   It wasn't a dead draw.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.060]   He continued to ask questions
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.080]   over the course of six or seven hours.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.680]   He would sacrifice a pawn,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.000]   he would sacrifice another pawn to damage the structure.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.960]   Valuation stayed the same,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.440]   because a machine could stop him, but not Jan.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.400]   And that was one of my favorite,
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   that game ruined my whole day, by the way.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.320]   It destroyed, because I made- - It took so long?
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.640]   - Yeah, I made so many plans that day,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.760]   it completely ruined my day,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.640]   but it was a very worthy recap.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.400]   - You were just all in, you watched that whole game?
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.260]   - I watched the whole game,
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.480]   and the World Championship was a crazy time,
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.220]   because I wanted to be first with the recap video,
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.860]   but I also wanted to be best with the recap video.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.620]   So I spent all the hours of the games
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.140]   watching all the live broadcasts,
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.980]   and getting all the information, all the variations,
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.580]   and trying to put that into the recap.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.420]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.740]   It was a huge adrenaline dump when it was all over.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.320]   - So just for people who don't know,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.420]   that's the most recent World Championship.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.520]   So you had a, I mean, that was a draw,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.620]   after draw, after draw, after draw.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.460]   - Yeah.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.340]   - And it was kind of boring in that way.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.060]   Or maybe, are draws, is there non-boring parts
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.860]   within the draw to you,
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.100]   when you were just studying it carefully?
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.640]   - For me, yes.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.580]   For the average viewer, no.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.400]   That's the truth.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.780]   Especially when the game itself is not that exciting.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.980]   When Magnus plays a strange move on move nine or 10
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.060]   that hasn't ever been played,
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.740]   and then Jan has to try to exploit it,
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.220]   and he fails, and no attack builds up,
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.460]   and they shuffle their pieces for three hours.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.180]   - My favorite thing is when the commentator's like,
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.460]   "I don't know why he did that.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.740]   "I wonder why he did that."
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.740]   Like, when the commentators are confused,
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.340]   that's my, as a person who's just a spectator,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.940]   just like, that's interesting.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.840]   'Cause then you, the most interesting part
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.820]   is about listening to the commentators,
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.740]   who I guess themselves might be grandmasters.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.060]   - Or all. - Yeah.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.540]   They are trying to, I guess, just like Nepo,
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.300]   just like Magnus, try to figure out,
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.780]   what's the idea here?
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.100]   What are you thinking?
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.940]   That's cool.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.460]   That's an interesting part of the game.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.000]   But other than that, it seemed,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.100]   yeah, I was sure this was just gonna keep being a draw,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.640]   especially in that situation.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.220]   So it's almost, it seems almost remarkable
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.220]   that Magnus was able to pull out a win in game seven.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.420]   In game six.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.580]   And after that, at least Magnus said that that ends it,
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.240]   because now Nepo's gonna have to take more risks,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.260]   and that opens it up to pure chess.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.340]   And then, who was it?
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.960]   Steve Prefontaine said, "Whenever there's a race,
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.780]   "it's down to pure guts, then that's when I win it."
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.700]   - There was also a conversation about Jan's first half,
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.140]   second half, in any tournament.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.540]   In the first half, he's just brilliant on fire.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.640]   You could even say he was outplaying Magnus.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.940]   But the entire conversation before the match was,
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.180]   Jan slows down.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.220]   And at the first sign of a loss or a setback,
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.640]   the match might fall apart.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.180]   And that was the worst way to lose.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.700]   There was literally no worse way.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.220]   And it just got worse from there and there.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.920]   I mean, it was one move mistakes.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.940]   But he's back.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.700]   Jan has won the candidates again.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.140]   He's gonna play for the world championship.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.740]   So who you got?
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.580]   - Who you got?
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.200]   What is this slang terminology?
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.100]   Can we somehow edit that into a more sophisticated
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.360]   with a British accent type of phraseology?
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.380]   Okay, who do you think will win that match?
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.820]   - I think it's 55-45, but I don't know for who.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.660]   I don't know for who.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.780]   - That's not the--
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.620]   - So it's close.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.860]   - It's very close.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.080]   You can make both cases.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.020]   You could say, "Ding."
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.140]   You could say, "Jan has been here before."
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.360]   You can say, "To the world championship stage.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.840]   He knows what it's like to have a training camp,"
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.800]   and so on and so forth.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.060]   His playing style is very...
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.600]   But you can also say Ding Liran
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.320]   is one of the most stable,
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.720]   unemotional chess players.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.800]   And Ding oftentimes goes from down to up.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   So in the candidates, he lost to Jan in the very first game.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.800]   14 round tournament, he got demolished in the first game.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.300]   I'm sure he was suffering from jet lag, the flight.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.860]   He came to Spain like two days before the games began,
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.400]   which was crazy to me.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.140]   And he got second place by the end.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.580]   His chances of finishing in the top two were like 2%.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.520]   After that first round game,
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.720]   people wrote him off completely.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.640]   So he doesn't go from top down.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.320]   He goes the opposite way.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.400]   And if he loses, he might come back.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.680]   But the truth is, I don't know.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.800]   The truth is it's gonna be an interesting match.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   And it's also disappointing
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.040]   we're not gonna get Magnus in it.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.000]   - Yeah, what do you think about him
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.280]   stepping away from the world championship?
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.640]   Are you a romantic about the world championships?
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.800]   - No, I'm not a romantic about anything, I don't think.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.880]   I can't imagine what-- - He's dark.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.040]   That went dark quickly.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.160]   - I don't think I'm sophisticated enough to be a romantic.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.880]   I think I taught chess and now I make YouTube videos.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.120]   I'm not qualified on the subject of romanticism, but I--
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.840]   - You don't think it's a beautiful game?
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.680]   - Chess? - Yeah.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.080]   - No, I think it is a beautiful game.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.960]   - There you go, I got you.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   - Yeah.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.480]   Is that considered being a romantic?
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.520]   - Yeah, I was seeing the beauty in the,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.280]   you can be like Bach and seeing the math in the music,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.720]   but you can see the beauty, the magic.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.840]   - I think I see beauty in certain types of chess for sure,
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.740]   not in all chess, so I'll partially romantic.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.760]   - Part-time romantic. - Yeah.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.440]   - Yeah, so what do you feel about Magnus
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.120]   stepping away from the world championships?
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.160]   - Disappointing, but understandable.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.000]   - Can you still man his case?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.940]   What's understandable about it to you?
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.600]   - I don't think it's as prestigious as it could be.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.560]   I don't think-- - The world championships?
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.920]   - Why does Magnus still sign everything as world champion?
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.600]   - That's a good point, that he did just put out a statement
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.800]   and he did say-- - But he does it
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.400]   everywhere else too. - Does he really?
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.880]   - Yeah, like world champion, right?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.000]   World champion. - Oh, I don't know.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.840]   - World chess champion.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.960]   - Maybe it's just because he won it,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   but he thinks that the journey to the top once again
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.080]   to maintain the status quo has lost its appeal.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.480]   You know what the example that I like to make?
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.840]   I'm a big fan of UFC.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.000]   So we've never really seen,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.960]   with the exception of George St. Pierre walking,
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.760]   and Khabib, but Khabib was kind of a different story,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.200]   walking away from a belt
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.880]   at the absolute zenith of their career.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.400]   But also in the UFC,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.480]   champions are extremely well taken care of.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.320]   The champions have some of the best lives.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.760]   Of course, you can argue not all champions,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.520]   you can say some of the lower weight divisions, yes.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   But what I'm saying is a lot of them get all the sponsors,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.360]   they get massive, massive paydays,
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.120]   they're international celebrities.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.600]   I don't think chess has that.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.200]   In fact, the world championship of chess prize fund
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.680]   has not changed much in like 40 years.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.840]   - So you could probably make more money on YouTube.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.320]   - Yes. - Playing randos,
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.120]   not randos, but other, having fun
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.320]   and playing challenging, really challenging games,
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.060]   playing other super grandmasters, like an ad hoc events,
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.720]   or maybe a little bit organized events,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.320]   but not the world championship.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.800]   - Yeah. - And still have a lot of fun,
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.100]   make a lot of money, get everybody excited,
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.940]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.940]   - Yeah, so for Magnus specifically,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.580]   and we're using him because he's the world champion,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.880]   if you tally, if he wins every tournament
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.200]   that he plays in over the course of a year,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.860]   which is really not even that crazy of an estimate,
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.840]   'cause that's really how it seems sometimes.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.640]   I don't know how much money that is, I haven't tallied,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.480]   but if he dedicated an entire year
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.500]   to being managed on social media and doing various things
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.000]   and growing all his brands and getting sponsor deals,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.020]   I think he would make five times more
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.960]   than being the world champion, which is crazy.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.360]   - Yeah, but money isn't everything.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.200]   - I know, that's totally fair.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.560]   - Some people dedicate their whole life
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.840]   to winning the Olympics.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.120]   The Olympics is an interesting one too,
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.940]   because I didn't even watch the Olympics
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.540]   as carefully as I usually do.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.300]   - This year, yeah, me neither.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.020]   - It's really strange, I'm not sure why that is.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.980]   And during COVID, I'm not sure, that was weird.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.020]   I don't know if it's losing its magic.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.140]   Part of it is also the people that own the Olympics
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.660]   and the way they distribute it,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.260]   they make it a little bit more difficult to watch.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.180]   It should, in my opinion, it should all be just available
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.340]   on YouTube and easily accessible.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.900]   It's like the difference between SpaceX
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.740]   and some other, even NASA, just SpaceX is better
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.120]   at streaming their launches and commentating them.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.480]   They've made NASA better as well,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.100]   but just the ability, it sounds ridiculous,
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.860]   but making it more frictionless for people to watch,
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.860]   get excited, to share, all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   I'm not exactly sure where the magic balance is
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.620]   between the classy, traditional world championships
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.620]   and the dramatic, exciting streamer world.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.020]   And it feels like for the world championships
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.060]   to be relevant, they have to find that balance.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.500]   - Yeah, well, this recent one had, I was--
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.020]   - It's pretty good commentating, yeah.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.820]   - No, I'm not even necessarily talking about myself.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.540]   There was a lot of-- - No, that was the worst part
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.060]   for me. (laughing)
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.300]   No. - There was--
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.380]   - Well, every single-- - No, you did amazing, yeah.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.220]   - I appreciate that.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.820]   It was a lot of, it was a big arms race.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.820]   So every major chess platform tried to get
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:38.020]   one super grandmaster, Vishwanathan Anand,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.020]   Fabiano Caruana, you name it, they were basically involved.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.900]   And to go back to that point, yeah,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.100]   the big question is money.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.980]   And if Magnus is not motivated by money,
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.580]   if the price fund for the next world championship
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.300]   was $10 million, would he play it?
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.340]   If he says no, then it must be something else.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.580]   It must just be a matter of something's not worth it.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.420]   It's not worth-- - You gotta take him
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.300]   at his word, and his word is like,
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:07.620]   there's too much stress to the low sample play.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.900]   - Yeah. - Like I wanna play
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.780]   many more times. - Yeah, he wants to play more.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.620]   He wants to-- - Shorter games.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.700]   - He wants to make it more interesting, yeah, exactly.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.500]   - Yeah, more shorter games, like where you can,
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.540]   increase the possibility of pure chess,
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.380]   whatever the heck that means.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.100]   - Yeah, but we can't go back to the first
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.820]   Karpov-Kasparov match, which they had to stop
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.900]   due to health concerns.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.660]   I mean, the guy went down five nil,
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.740]   and it was first to six wins, and draws didn't count.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.780]   So draws didn't amass to the total score.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.860]   There was no best of system.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.300]   - So what happened there?
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.380]   - The match went something like seven, eight months.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.980]   Kasparov started making a comeback
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.180]   after being down five nothing.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.020]   He was five three, and they called it off.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.860]   They called it off, they said,
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.340]   "The players are in poor health conditions."
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.820]   Kasparov stormed down, yelled that this is a farce.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.980]   But the match was 50 games long, even more maybe.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.260]   I made a video, and I don't even remember
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.100]   how many games it was.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.740]   It was so long.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.580]   Can you imagine?
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.660]   Bobby Fischer wanted something almost as extreme.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.340]   Draws don't count, it's first one to 10 wins.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.500]   And if it's nine nine,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.780]   the world champion retains his title.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.620]   So you have to beat the world champion 10 eight.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.660]   That's the only way.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.780]   - You don't like that?
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.340]   - It's just grueling.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.460]   - I don't know, maybe I like it for the YouTube recaps,
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.140]   but do I like it for the players?
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.260]   Do I like it for general public?
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.100]   No. - Torture.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.780]   - Yeah, it's three, four hours, right?
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.540]   Imagine your favorite tennis match was six months long.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.980]   What are we doing?
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.780]   - Yeah, yeah, there's still a magic
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.980]   to the world championship.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.140]   I wish they could make it some interesting,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.820]   make it work somehow.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.300]   But I think Magnus is really challenging FIDE
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.780]   and everybody else to step up and try to figure that out,
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.140]   which is great ultimately.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.660]   Who would you say is the greatest of all time?
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.340]   Can you make the case, you mentioned Kasparov,
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.620]   can you make the case for Kasparov,
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.300]   can you make the case for Magnus Carlsen,
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.420]   Bobby Fischer, Tall?
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.540]   - In my opinion, you can make a case
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.340]   for Magnus, Gary, and Bobby Fischer.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.260]   I'm not one of the folks that's like,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.220]   I mean, Capablanca was brilliant.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.060]   You can argue Steinitz was brilliant,
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:18.060]   but I think it's probably Kasparov
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.420]   and Magnus has a chance to overtake it.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.580]   - So the longevity is really important to you
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.660]   when you're thinking about this.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.860]   - Yes, I think so.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.380]   I think Magnus is very, very close.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.060]   It's extremely close.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.900]   - What would be the magic?
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.860]   - You gotta get that sixth one.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.940]   - Oh, so the-- - No, I'm just kidding.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.220]   - So the world championships matter.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.500]   - It's kind of like basketball, right?
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.220]   Rings, it all comes down to,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.100]   how many rings did this person win?
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.020]   - What about, well, basketball doesn't have this,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.780]   the number of years at number one, right?
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   Like rating, sorry.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.620]   - Yeah.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:58.140]   - Which is what Magnus really likes,
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.820]   is like there is a nice system of rating
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.580]   of who is ranked number one.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.260]   It has to do not with some championships
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.420]   or low-sampled tournaments.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.340]   It has to do with general, game after game after game
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.140]   helps estimate more accurately the ELO rating.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.820]   - Yeah, he's been world number one for, I think, 11 years.
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.420]   - Which is still less than--
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.940]   - Yeah, he was world number one for 20 years.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.180]   Yeah, which is quite wild.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.380]   - But still lower rating, I think, than Magnus now, right?
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.060]   - Yeah, I think rating in general has sort of--
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.740]   - Allegedly, it got inflated?
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.580]   - Yeah. - Is that true?
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.940]   Is there a truth to that?
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.900]   - I think so.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.460]   I can't speak to how exactly it happened,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.940]   but it also happens online.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.780]   If you go back just three or four years,
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.060]   I think some of the best Blitz players on,
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.500]   let's say, chess.com were 27, 2,800,
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.700]   and now they're 3,200.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.020]   I think it's just sort of what happens,
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.180]   but I don't exactly know.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.140]   I will mention that there was a very strange change,
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.140]   not exactly sure when the year was, in FIDE,
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.060]   so over-the-board chess, where if you were
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:06.380]   under the age of 16 or 18 years old, one of those two,
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.760]   and you were below 2,300, okay?
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.500]   Your rating change factor was three to four times higher.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.720]   So just imagine what that means.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.060]   Magnus has a rating change factor of, let's say, one.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.840]   I have a rating change factor also of one.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.800]   Anybody over the rating 2,400
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   has the same rating change factor.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   - Oh, what is the rating change factor?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.640]   So if you win--
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.840]   - Yeah, there's a formula, and basically,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.960]   let's say at the very base level, five-point change,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.920]   if your rating change factor is one.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.160]   You beat somebody, you gain five points.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.520]   Those kids who were under 18 and under 2,300,
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.360]   their rating change factor was four.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.000]   So their ratings were going up four times higher
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.240]   and four times up and down compared to normal folks,
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.360]   and there was one teenager in the US in particular
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.540]   who in one month played a bunch of tournaments
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.960]   with his rating change factor
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.840]   and became nearly rated 2,640,
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   which is top 50 in the world.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.760]   He was just a random teenager from the United States.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.640]   He became a grandmaster ultimately,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.480]   but he bled like 90 points down
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.760]   because his rating was so inflated.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.520]   And the K40 exists now.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.240]   I mean, you have many kids who out of nowhere,
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.680]   2,100, 2,100, 2,400 after one good month.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.080]   It's like, what?
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.920]   - So that's interesting.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   That's like similar to how TikTok inflates your virality
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.480]   early on.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.600]   - Does it?
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.440]   - Well, yeah.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.240]   Like I, well, at least the rumor is like,
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.880]   they want you to get engaged.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.600]   And I thought there was even artificial likes and so on,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.920]   that they want you to get that dopamine addiction.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.520]   So maybe they want to throw you,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.960]   if you're really passionate about chess,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.080]   they want you to throw you to the sharks
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.480]   by artificially inflating you, inflating your rating.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.880]   And maybe that gets you into the game much more intensely.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.720]   - Maybe.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.100]   - I wonder how many like backdoor feed-in meetings
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.180]   there are with cigars.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.420]   And so that was the factors determined by,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.860]   who does the ELO rating?
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   - Who changes this stuff?
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.700]   - Yeah.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.940]   - Who knows?
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.180]   - It's probably those leech-ass anarchists.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.020]   - Exactly.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.700]   I think they wanna stay away from that stuff.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.180]   - So there's a guy named Hans Nieman.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.540]   - Yep.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:40.540]   - And he beat Magnus Carlsen recently.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.380]   - Yeah.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.740]   - Has it been already, what is, was it August?
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.560]   - September 4th.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.960]   - Oh, it was September?
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.540]   So he beat him twice, right, recently.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:54.540]   Once is the allegations by the internet
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.080]   that Hans Nieman cheated.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.380]   And then the second time,
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.380]   Magnus played a few moves and forfeited and resigned.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.140]   - There's actually, so there's three.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:06.980]   - Okay, sorry.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.940]   - No, no, yeah.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.780]   - Can we go through the stuff?
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.140]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   So they play a live e-sports event in Miami,
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.540]   Miami Beach.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.360]   - Yes.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.200]   - Eatin' Rock.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.900]   - That's where I actually interviewed Magnus, yeah.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.980]   - That's where that was?
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.820]   Oh.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.140]   - By weird circumstance, I found myself in Miami
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.220]   unrelated to the chess event.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.100]   And yeah, it was a very dramatic event for me
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.000]   for various reasons.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.620]   One of which the camera stopped working
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.700]   halfway through the conversation.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.100]   - I saw that, yeah, I saw that.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.100]   I also, side note, I really respect how you write comments,
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.820]   pin them at the top, you add timestamps.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.180]   You're like very true professional.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.000]   I am the complete opposite on YouTube
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.460]   when I'm off the camera.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.580]   So I dig in the mud.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.580]   - What does that mean, dig in the mud?
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.120]   - From when I started on YouTube in 2020,
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.040]   in June, like May, June, 2020, I had no subscribers.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.000]   So I got to a million in a year.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.360]   I had a lot of people analyzing my every move,
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.640]   all of my small flaws.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   And I love getting hate comments because--
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.480]   - You pin, is it the comment of shame or something?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.440]   - That's what it was, it's been named over the years
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.200]   by folks, I never called it that,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.840]   but yeah, it's pin of shame.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.160]   - Pin of shame, yes.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.160]   - It's been tough because now people pretend
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.880]   to write hate comments just to get attention.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.380]   So like anything, the public ruined the good thing.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:39.340]   But it started that way.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.200]   It started with people just shredding me to bits,
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.480]   calling me spin-offs of this and that.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   And I think I'm a human more than I am a creator,
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.320]   an influencer, an attention seeker.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.000]   Like I'm just a person.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.520]   So to me, even at the size of 1.6 million subscribers now,
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.320]   September 2022, I don't understand that I've gotten big
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.560]   and that I shouldn't do this stuff
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.680]   and that I should be beyond it
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.400]   or I shouldn't be checking my social media
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.520]   as much as I do and interacting one-on-one.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.360]   I'm still very much a human being.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.840]   And my guilty pleasure, my way of killing time
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.400]   if I'm not laying on the couch
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.200]   and playing some Chaz Blitz games off stream
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.720]   is I just interact with people who say nice things
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.240]   and who say horrible things.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.200]   And I really like to get into the head of the people
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.800]   who say the terrible things.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.920]   And sometimes you can, sometimes they are truly trolls,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.600]   but sometimes people just, they just really hate you.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.240]   - What's a successful interaction
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.920]   with the person that's trolling you?
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.360]   What's like at the end of that hero journey
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.880]   that you were partaking in,
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.560]   what's the top of the mountain look like?
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.160]   Is the troll conquered and broken mentally?
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.040]   - No, not mentally.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.440]   I don't wanna defeat.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.720]   I honestly sometimes, somebody writes a very long comment,
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.000]   I'll just, I'll respond with a question mark.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.440]   - Yeah.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.080]   Oh, so you're, you see each other as like a brother
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.680]   and sister, you're gonna travel together
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.600]   on this journey of deep meaning,
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.560]   like introspection of what does this mean?
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.800]   - Yeah, I've had people write, I can't quote now,
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.720]   but something about my persona, my behavior,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.680]   this and that, and I just like respond to them.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.860]   And I say, hey, it sounds crazy
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.840]   that a large creator might do something like this,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.320]   but this kind of goes back to,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.400]   you speak to folks on a very respectful way.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.320]   If you make a mistake, you completely own up to it.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.160]   So I have this sometimes,
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.400]   these one-on-one interactions where I say,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.060]   I think you're reading too much into this.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.980]   I think you're kind of, you don't understand
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.640]   maybe some of my humor or sarcasm as such.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.080]   So you form this opinion that I'm this kind of a person,
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.000]   this and that, and now you're sort of,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.520]   anything I do, you're trying to attach to that reasoning
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.880]   and here you are writing this lengthy essay
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.320]   of why nobody should watch my content.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.160]   And sometimes people go, you know what?
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.000]   I think you have a point.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.960]   Maybe I should relax a little bit.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.600]   - Yeah, I would love to sort of interview
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.160]   and understand the lives of the folks
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.360]   that post that kind of stuff.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.000]   I mean, they're human beings.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   They have interesting journeys also.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.120]   I think they often don't realize,
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.720]   I think they don't realize their comment
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.520]   will be read by anybody, especially you.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.000]   They think like, and they also don't realize
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.280]   you're a human being, I feel like.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.040]   - That's, it's so interesting to watch it.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.680]   Like some guy, 'cause I posted on Twitter
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.480]   for like a minute that I'm talking to you
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.120]   and asking for questions.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.160]   I deleted that tweet because,
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.240]   - Yeah, not 'cause you didn't like it.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   - 95% of the people were talk about cheating,
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   talk about the cheating.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.520]   All right, I got it, thank you.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.400]   This is not gonna be helpful at all.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.360]   So I was like, all right.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.880]   But in that time, like there was one comment,
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   which it's hilarious to me that you found
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.480]   that one comment.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.000]   The one comment says like,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.120]   this seems like a waste of time or something.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.600]   Like why talk, - Lame guest.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.360]   - Lame guest. - Lame guest.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.200]   Lame guest.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.920]   - And then you like responded something like
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.800]   with a question mark.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.080]   - Yeah, yeah, I wrote, why am I a lame guest?
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.080]   - Why am I, let's talk about this.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.320]   - Yeah, I was like, why am I a lame guest?
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.120]   And he responded, he responded even after
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.480]   you deleted the tweet. - Yeah, what did he say?
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.920]   - He said he doesn't know what value I would bring
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.600]   because I just make videos about chess games.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   And that's true, you've had some absolutely
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.080]   brilliant people on.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.600]   But I also looked at this gentleman's profile
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:34.360]   and he was one of the folks that put things
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.980]   about his family and God and his politics
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.460]   in his Twitter bio.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.600]   And I started thinking, maybe I said something
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.560]   in some video and I made a joke about religion
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.780]   or something, just some offhand five second thing
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.640]   somewhere that someone turns me into just
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.260]   an absolute outcast in their household.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.100]   They can no longer watch me.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.160]   And that has happened.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.000]   - Yeah. - That has happened.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.760]   I'll record a 30 minute video and I'll make a joke
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.520]   about something and some phrasing and that's it.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.800]   I've lost the viewer forever and they will let me know.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.540]   They will write me an email and I just don't think
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.020]   people should be that serious.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.660]   - Yeah, there's some of that 'cause I've seen people
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.740]   say that, sometimes about me, but I see it more
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.960]   with others.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.520]   They'll say, I used to be, like Joe Rogan gets this.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.080]   - Yeah. - I used to be a huge fan
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.140]   of Joe Rogan until he said this.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.960]   - Mm-hmm. - Right, it's like one.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.860]   First, I do wonder if you were ever really a big fan.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.840]   That's one question mark I have.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.680]   But the other is like, I think we should be more lenient
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.920]   with each other in terms of how much stupid shit we say.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.080]   - Yeah. - And you know,
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.920]   if you actually, I wish people were able to sort of
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.200]   introspect on their own, on the stupid shit
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.060]   they say themselves, like to have a little bit of empathy.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.880]   I wish there was a way to read all the emails
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.080]   you've ever written and just to see,
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.640]   or maybe do a search engine for all the stupid shit
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   you've said in emails in the past and summarize it
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.120]   and to reveal it to yourself that you have bad days,
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.280]   you have good days, you have emotional days,
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.840]   you have stoic days.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   Sometimes you have, you take very different political views
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.720]   than you do on other days, and it's like,
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.640]   it's all over the place.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.920]   And if you're a creator, if you're putting stuff out
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   all the time, you're gonna have those,
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.920]   and you're still a full, complex bag of emotions
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   and thoughts and ideas and contradictions and all of that.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.480]   Like, you shouldn't judge a person by a single statement.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.720]   And even when you do, you should try to infer
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.180]   the best possible interpretation of that statement.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.640]   I feel like that's just a healthier way to interact
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.380]   with the world and with other humans.
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.520]   It's like, I wonder what's the best possible interpretation
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.200]   of the thing they just tweeted or they said.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.720]   Let's imagine that the person saying those words
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.800]   is actually a really good human being,
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.120]   and what did they mean when they said
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.680]   that thing about anal beads?
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.080]   - Right, it was so good for so long.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:17.920]   - Yeah, right.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.240]   Or whatever it is.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.840]   Like, they didn't mean to be offensive
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.320]   to the sexuality of a certain group.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.440]   They're just talking shit about anal beads.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.600]   Like, they're not, like, sometimes it's humor.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.440]   Sometimes it's actually genuinely embodying
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.960]   like a political viewpoint, and like walking with it,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.920]   thinking through it for a few days.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.160]   Like, taking it seriously, empathizing,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.600]   not just for a brief moment, but for a time.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.120]   Like, walking with an idea,
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.520]   and allowing yourself to express it.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.000]   Like, playing devil's advocate, I do that all the time.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   - With yourself?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.840]   - With myself, yeah.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.080]   In conversation, I do too, and I find I have to say,
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.000]   I'm playing devil's advocate.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.480]   Like, you have to be very explicit,
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   but with myself, I'll just do it in my head.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.600]   Like, I have different voices.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.780]   Like, you know, obviously,
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.560]   I've been getting so much information, so many thoughts
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.840]   in all the complexities of the war in Ukraine, for example,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.160]   and all the different voices within Ukraine.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.960]   I just interviewed hundreds of people,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.400]   and they have very different perspectives
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.080]   in nuanced ways about the war.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.040]   Some are full of hate, some are full of love.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.160]   Like, hate for the other, love for their own country,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.880]   love for family and tradition.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.040]   All of it, it's a beautiful mix, and I have to walk,
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.120]   I have to carry those ideas in my head
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.680]   and empathize with them deeply,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.120]   and then I have to listen to people that live elsewhere,
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.280]   that live in India, that have a very different perspective.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.400]   There's a lot of people in India
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.760]   that have a very different perspective
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.480]   than the people in Ukraine.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.280]   So, I don't know, and some of that will bleed out
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.880]   into the thoughts I express publicly.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.920]   And when people judge you harshly for it,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.160]   first of all, me as a human being,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.520]   it's psychologically difficult,
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.520]   but also, it makes me less willing to be fragile.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.520]   I still try to be strong enough to be fragile
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.160]   in front of the camera, just say,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.440]   like, say things that are on my mind,
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.280]   even if I know it's going to create people
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:41.100]   that are going to be, like, ruthlessly negative towards me.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.040]   So, I try to wear my heart on my sleeve,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.280]   and still try to be fragile, but it's harder.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.440]   You're going to pay a psychological cost.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.560]   Like, in some sense, I try to be tough,
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.960]   but I can be a softie in that,
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   in certain attacks can get to me.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.880]   So, I'm surprised that they don't get,
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.800]   I mean, does some negativity get to you?
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.720]   Or is this the way you deal with it, by responding?
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.560]   Like, that guy saying,
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.920]   what value does talking to a lot of you add to the world?
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.400]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   No, but that was, I mean, that was so good.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.680]   I was looking at, I was thinking at various moments,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.240]   you went to jump in, and I was kind of letting you speak.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.560]   One of the things I wanted to mention
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.720]   was it's significantly simpler to talk about chess
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.160]   than it is to talk about some of the things you talk about,
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.400]   and you have a big responsibility,
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.160]   because you have to absorb information like a sponge,
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.520]   but you also then need to present it in a way
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.200]   where you potentially have an opinion
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.760]   while trying to be fair to everybody.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.920]   And you're talking about things
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.760]   that will literally never please everybody,
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.600]   just literally.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.800]   So, you're gonna talk about some issues
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.300]   that are going to get out there into the,
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.080]   people are gonna watch it,
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.540]   the eyes, right, the ears of millions of people,
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.600]   and not everybody is going to be satisfied,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.300]   and these are issues where people are going to be
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:10.160]   much more likely to speak up in all sorts of ways.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.400]   - Like tremendous support or tremendous hatred, vitriol,
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.800]   and God knows what else.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.720]   Yeah, you, it's one of the reasons
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.640]   I'm blown away to even be sitting here, frankly,
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.120]   because up until a few months ago,
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.560]   you weren't talking to, you know,
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.640]   I'm not saying you weren't talking to,
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.120]   but you hadn't spoken to chess players.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.320]   You were speaking to people who were doing
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.880]   much more substantial things in the world.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.520]   - I appreciate the humility there.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.840]   - No, but--
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   - Chess, to me, is incredible, is a beautiful game,
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.240]   but I think the reason comments hurt
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.920]   is not, I mean, they hurt no matter what, to me.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.320]   Like-- - Not to me.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.960]   Because I'm in a simpler space.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.200]   That's what you have to understand.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.360]   I-- - Even if,
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.540]   so if it's chess-based criticism,
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.280]   it doesn't hit as hard.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.320]   - No, if you had a podcast about,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.000]   anal bees, no, I'm just,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.880]   if you had a podcast-- - I am launching this.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   - If you had a podcast about-- - I'm launching a new podcast.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.600]   - Photography, you gotta realize,
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   like, it wouldn't be the same way.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.220]   You talk about potentially existential things.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.720]   You talk about cyber, you know,
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.800]   things in cybersecurity or AI
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.060]   or people who are massive heads of companies
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.640]   that are just inherently going to be
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.580]   a bit more controversial.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.320]   So that, I can't imagine being in your shoes
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.280]   because you have so many complex emotions about situations
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.600]   where you may not necessarily agree with everything
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.100]   that someone has said publicly,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.400]   but you still invite them for a conversation
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.480]   because they're a human being.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.040]   It's totally different, like, it's not--
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.940]   - I don't know, not the way I experience it.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.000]   To me, I think what hurts is,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.280]   it's not even on my, 'cause I'm super self-critical,
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.840]   usually way more than the internet can be.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.800]   It's that, like, human beings can be cruel to each other.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.200]   So like, the reason it hurts for some reason,
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.400]   it's like, it's almost like, there's disappointment
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.280]   in people, they don't give each other a chance.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.480]   So in that sense, the negativity doesn't have to be
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.240]   about Ukraine or geopolitics.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.600]   It could be about the silliest of things.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.440]   - I see.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.960]   - And like, to me, it's like, why be mean to each other?
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.160]   In a context where the mean doesn't,
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.480]   like, it's out of place.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.120]   'Cause like, for example, there is like a gaming culture
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.880]   where they just talk shit to each other nonstop.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.200]   I think it's more acceptable there.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.280]   It seems to fit.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.360]   It seems to be funnier there.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.600]   And like, when streamers talk shit to each other.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.680]   I've been listening to several streamers recently,
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.840]   and it's like, it somehow works a little better,
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.600]   even if they're just, like, cruel to each other.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.280]   It makes more sense.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.000]   But I think when people are genuinely trying to educate
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.720]   or to help and so on, and you still get the shitty comments,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.080]   I don't know, it makes me sad.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.800]   - No, it doesn't make me sad.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.960]   I think part of that is also the way I was brought up.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.160]   So I was, I skipped kindergarten,
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.520]   so I was always the smallest kid.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.560]   And--
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.080]   - You were picked on?
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.180]   - I was picked on, and then I did picking.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.000]   So I had kind of both in my life.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.740]   I kind of know I went home from summer camp crying,
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.960]   and I also made a kid cry once in fourth grade.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.520]   So I had the balance.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.960]   - A physical or mental abuse?
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.780]   Or both?
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.620]   - Verbal.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.560]   I didn't beat anybody up, I was tiny.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.160]   I think the kid in the younger grade was bigger than I was.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.280]   - And you still broke him?
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.920]   - Because I was, yeah.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.880]   - Well done, well done.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.520]   - So I had to use my--
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.600]   - Mental warfare.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.640]   - I had to use my words.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.200]   I had to be, and growing up,
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.040]   my parents split when I was super young, and I played chess.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.960]   So all things that make you super self-trustworthy.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.320]   Like you believe your first instinct,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.960]   you don't listen to what other people tell you.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.500]   And if people give you advice, say, okay,
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.400]   I'm gonna think about that.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.800]   I'm not gonna go and do that.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.240]   I wasn't impressionable.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.600]   You couldn't convince me to do something.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.520]   That's stuck to this day.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.840]   My wife has had to deconstruct some of my stubbornness
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.240]   I didn't even realize was incredible stubbornness.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.980]   It's just something that you brought up with.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.000]   So to me, that stuff doesn't bother me.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.400]   - So the voices of others don't shake you quite.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.400]   They can't mentally shake your psychological stability.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.240]   - No, they haven't.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.280]   I think when it got, probably at its worst point
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.000]   was in combination with being unable to perform well
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.440]   in over-the-board play, but that was also self-driven.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.000]   I wasn't performing poorly because I was getting comments,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.940]   but because I was performing poorly,
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.760]   the comments got to me more,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.660]   the cycle was sort of in the opposite direction.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.660]   And that was probably the most frustrating out.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.460]   But people have said some vile things to me,
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.540]   you know, about my whole Indonesia thing.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.380]   - Ooh, this is good.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:08.780]   This is gonna give the anarchist in Lee Chess some humor.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.820]   Let's go, what's the Indonesia thing?
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:11.660]   - Yeah.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.480]   - The way you said, okay,
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.780]   maybe we don't wanna talk about it, but let's talk about it.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.260]   - No, it's totally fine.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.180]   - Who did you kill?
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.380]   - I didn't, I was gonna say I wish,
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.880]   but I'm not even sure I can make a joke like that.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:29.060]   So the Indonesia thing was I was streaming chess
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.760]   on chess.com, I might add.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:35.060]   And I got booted up a 10 minute game,
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.140]   just a random account from Indonesia.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.100]   That was the flag.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.700]   Now, mind you on these websites, you can pick your flag.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.220]   It can be from wherever, it's not geo-tracing,
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.260]   you can change it.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.060]   I was like, okay, account from Indonesia.
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.820]   And as always, I looked at the account
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.420]   'cause it was a untitled high rated account.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.820]   And I looked through the games,
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.140]   win rate was suspiciously high,
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.740]   average accuracy was suspiciously high.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.180]   I'm like, okay, I think this is a cheater.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.140]   I said it out loud.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.020]   It's not the first time I've played cheaters on stream.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.140]   And I said, okay, I'm still gonna play.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.740]   Let's see what happens.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.360]   The game was not crazy suspicious,
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.820]   but definitely suspicious.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.620]   A few critical moments where I just clearly thought
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.660]   I had a good position and then the person
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.420]   or the bot played some move that just killed my hopes.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.260]   And I lost.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.260]   I was like, okay, I lost.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.460]   And I wrote to the chess.com fair play team.
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.300]   Like behind the scenes,
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.340]   I wasn't even saying anything publicly on stream
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.260]   and the guy got banned.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.140]   It was a cheater.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.740]   So that night, right before I'm going to sleep,
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:42.340]   'cause Indonesia's 12 hours ahead of New York,
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.900]   I go on my Twitter.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.860]   The hell is going on?
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.900]   I see hundreds of responses to my recent tweets.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.220]   Levi, you got to check Facebook, man.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.660]   You got to check Facebook.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:52.140]   Like, here's a link.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:58.100]   So allegedly that account belonged to an older gentleman
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:02.140]   and his son made a Facebook post that said,
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.900]   my dad played a big streamer in chess, Gotham chess,
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.020]   and Gotham got mad.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.580]   He lost to my dad.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.260]   So his community mass reported my dad
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.100]   and he was banned for cheating.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:17.540]   Oh, it went viral.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.580]   - Oh no.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.780]   - Did you know that Indonesia
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.460]   has the fourth largest population in the world?
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.300]   I didn't know.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.460]   I learned it the hard way.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:26.300]   - Interesting.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.300]   - Tens of thousands of DMs every second.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:33.260]   Instagram DMs, 'cause I had my DMs open.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.060]   I was never afraid of that stuff.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:41.420]   My YouTube videos went from 99% downvote to 50, 50, 50.
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.340]   - 50, 50, 50?
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.180]   - Oh wow.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.500]   - They swarmed my comments.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.340]   - So all negative.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.340]   - All, play him again.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.940]   You, I mean, I don't know how much swearing
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:52.780]   there is on this podcast,
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.980]   but I mean, it was just all sorts of-
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.100]   - All the fucking swearing you want.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:00.780]   Just everything, ruthless, the vicious-
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.980]   - They were gonna kill me.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.300]   They were going to rape my family.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.500]   They were going to,
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.780]   they were contacting people I followed on Instagram.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.540]   They were contacting them and telling them crazy things.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.540]   It was, I'm not joking,
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.060]   it was tens of thousands of people every minute.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.020]   It was unbelievable.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:22.020]   And I didn't know what to do because the guy cheated.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.420]   I was in the right.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.260]   - Yeah.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.100]   - People-
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:25.920]   - How certain were you that he cheated?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.760]   - 100%.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.580]   - Okay.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:29.180]   - 100%, I mean, okay, I don't know if you can say 100%, but-
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:33.340]   - So just.com also had a suspicion.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.900]   - They, what I-
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.980]   - 'Cause they have like good,
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.620]   they have like good detection algorithms.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.300]   - Yes, Danny Wrench would be able to,
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.020]   I legitimately know nothing about the behind the scenes
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.060]   because it's only kind of tech people.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:49.060]   But one thing I did not realize was that this account,
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.580]   whether it was the son playing or the father playing,
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.540]   we will not know.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.460]   We don't know who played.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.300]   It could have been the son.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.980]   It could have been the dad covering for him, whatever.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.620]   But at some point that account won 27 games in a row
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.740]   at 95% accuracy.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.980]   I mean, even Magnus can't do that.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:06.100]   Even, you know, this took a month.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:09.260]   This story took one month from start to finish
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.980]   first I had to work with a like a media company
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:16.780]   to geo block my content in Indonesia on YouTube.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.500]   So Indonesians could not see my channel.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.460]   - Oh, so you didn't wanna like lean into it,
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.580]   go fool Donald Trump.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.420]   - No, no.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.740]   - Let's, 'cause you're in the right,
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.300]   you feel like you're in the right.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.140]   You, as far as you know, you're in the right.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.660]   - Yeah, and I hated watching all my work
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:34.580]   burn to the ground.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.260]   - Oh, you felt it was being.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:39.740]   - Yeah, and one thing I'm learning about myself
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.500]   is I'm not a good crisis actor.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.220]   I need someone to like slap me
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.260]   so I don't do something emotional in the moment
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.500]   when crisis is ongoing.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.300]   - What would be the emotional act
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.100]   that's not productive there?
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:55.020]   - Partnering with an MCN that makes you give away
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.220]   a bunch of your revenue.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.540]   And then when you break with them,
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.340]   I wasn't monetized for a week.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.620]   It was a very big decision to plug in.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.340]   I think they're called MCNs, but.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.180]   - What are they?
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.020]   Sorry, I don't, what are MCNs?
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.900]   - They're like, we, there's specialized agencies
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.940]   that work behind the scenes with YouTube
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.580]   that if you connect your account,
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.180]   they say they can give you certain ad benefits.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.180]   They can geo-block your content,
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.460]   which you can't do normally.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.540]   They have certain perks that only YouTube allows
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.380]   behind the scenes.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:26.420]   You pay them 10% of your monthly ad revenue,
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.940]   but they claim to do a handful of things for you.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.580]   I just needed them to geo-block my content.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.900]   I just didn't care how much money I was going
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.660]   to give away per month, but.
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:37.620]   - So why geo-block it?
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.240]   You just didn't like the downvoting?
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.340]   - Yeah, I didn't want.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.140]   - You wanted positivity?
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.740]   Like you're being educational?
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.740]   You're, I mean, they're like, you do a bit of shit talking,
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.500]   but it's more like fun and easygoing.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.660]   You didn't want this kind of viciousness.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.220]   - Yeah, my comment section was just being
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.300]   completely flooded.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.820]   Like they were destroying my channel.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.100]   And to be honest, maybe all of the views
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.140]   and the downvotes would have actually been beneficial.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.700]   Maybe it meant my videos would have actually
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.860]   started getting recommended to more people.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.140]   But I'm a person.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:11.980]   This all goes back to the same thing.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.540]   - Oh, so this got to you.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.660]   - Yeah, this was like, I was just watching it
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.780]   and I'm like, this is not fair.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.160]   This is, I don't know what to do.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.980]   So I'm gonna stop this as much as I can.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.380]   They still got through, they have VPN.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.940]   And they were like, you asshole,
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.900]   you don't think we have VPN in Indonesia?
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.300]   It was this whole, you know, it was this whole thing.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:33.140]   This father and son got invited to every major news network.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.020]   I'm not joking.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.060]   They got invited to the major podcast.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.900]   They like to say the Joe Rogan of Indonesia.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.740]   - Yeah.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.700]   - Dedy Korbuzied is this mentalist.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.020]   He's a bald guy, very fun guy.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.420]   He had them.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.060]   And that's when the Indonesian Chess Federation stepped in.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.700]   The thing is nobody who was harassing me
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.220]   knows anything about chess.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.140]   They just saw the story.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:56.060]   And long story short, they brought in a sponsor.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.780]   The guy played a strong,
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.580]   one of the strongest chess players in the country
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.620]   who also happens to be a woman, Irene Sukander.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.540]   She's like 2400 international master.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.940]   She crushed him because his actual playing strength
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:13.820]   is 1300, 1400, you, something like that.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.580]   He still got paid 'cause there was a winning prize fund,
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.980]   a losing prize fund.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.980]   And we never heard from him again.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.820]   And that was the whole story.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.500]   So that was why I had to shut down all of my social media
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.860]   to DMs and DM requests and even notifications.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.980]   Like I don't get notifications unless it's someone I follow.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.380]   - But see stuff like that doesn't often get resolved
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.580]   in this kind of clear way.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:35.660]   - No, it doesn't.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.500]   Could have been.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.180]   - So you got lucky there that there's a conclusion to this.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.540]   - Yeah, somebody got views, somebody got money.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:48.060]   I never got many apologies.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.140]   - What did you learn from that experience about yourself,
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.900]   about the internet?
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:58.140]   - I think first and foremost, I learned that every moment
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:03.060]   you are live or broadcasting can be completely blown out
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:03.900]   of proportion.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.020]   You have to be real careful.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.500]   And I can't actively think about that, unfortunately,
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.660]   even when I'm streaming.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.940]   I've had other instances where things come back to bite.
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.740]   I've even had these moments live on stream.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.460]   I feel like I said something too sarcastically to somebody
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.620]   and I don't know how their day is going.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.660]   It might ruin their whole day.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.260]   You know, God knows what, you have these moments of regret
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.980]   where you want your personality to shine through
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.260]   and you wanna entertain.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.220]   They start thinking at what cost,
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.940]   if I make a joke to a viewer that suddenly the whole chat
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.660]   is laughing at them, what if that puts them
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.100]   in a deep, dark place?
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.180]   And again, it all comes back to this one-on-one thing
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.740]   for me because I'm a human.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.900]   I would hate to put another person into that situation.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.780]   I would much rather get a drink with somebody,
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.540]   but it's all kind of part of this act
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.460]   and you wanna make jokes.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.340]   And I also learned I'm a horrible crisis actor.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.900]   So I have no patience, but I think that's normal in 2022.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.260]   Everything is immediate.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   We can barely sit, think, let time go by.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.460]   - It makes me sad 'cause I think that kind of stuff
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.900]   can destroy good people.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.020]   That's what makes you sad.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.540]   - Yeah, well, one of the things we discussed
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:17.460]   just here before recording, which I'm also,
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.620]   I've talked about this on stream.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.620]   I'm very open with this type of stuff is over the,
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.660]   I think for me, a lot of that comes down
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:25.580]   to just a lack of control of the narrative.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.900]   That phrase is kind of messy.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.380]   It can be used for political stuff,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.100]   but I hate when I say things
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.540]   and they get completely misconstrued
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.620]   or they are completely misinterpreted.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.140]   And I can't imagine being in your shoes
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.540]   because again, I do chess.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.780]   You cannot really, you can clip me saying something
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.500]   about a chess game out of context and it's hilarious.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.020]   You know, it's dumb.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.660]   It's nothing, it's not an attack on me
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.580]   or something that I said.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.660]   It's not an attack on, kind of more similarly
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.740]   to what you were describing.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.460]   - You don't say stuff like that,
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.180]   like ridiculous, you don't say ridiculous shit
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.300]   about yourself?
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.500]   - Oh, I do, I do, I do.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.220]   - And you don't feel like that could be made.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.460]   Isn't this the same guy that said X?
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:17.980]   - Maybe, maybe I either haven't said enough
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.420]   of those things or there's no moments in,
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.780]   I don't have three, four hour open conversations
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.620]   with other humans.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.700]   And I'm pretty sure if I did,
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.060]   there would be more of that stuff out there.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.780]   But it's probably what it is,
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:34.700]   it's just a lack of being able to kind of control
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.980]   what is actually reality.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.180]   And that is very frustrating.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.900]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.100]   I mean, there is a sense that there's not enough motivation
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.620]   for people to attack you.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.020]   You're ultimately adding a lot of positive stuff
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.980]   to the world.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.220]   And when you get into more political topics,
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.460]   there's people who are hurting,
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.260]   who have a lot of anger in their hearts
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.700]   and they want to direct it towards you.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.540]   So then they need ammunition and ammunition comes in the way
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.780]   of like clips from the past.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.900]   So I'm sure that you,
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.020]   I'm pretty sure you already have clips like that.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.020]   It's just, there's not people that really have anger
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.940]   to direct towards you.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.300]   Ultimately you're adding a lot of good stuff to the world.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.140]   And so, yeah, but it's man,
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.380]   the viciousness of human beings
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.100]   under the veil of anonymity at scale can be really painful.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.340]   So that's, I guess that's the curse,
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:32.100]   the challenge of being a creator on YouTube
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.900]   and so on, on Twitch.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:39.100]   When you talked about retiring,
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.180]   I think you tweeted about retiring from chess.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.940]   - I made a video, yeah, I tweeted.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.420]   It's my value to the world.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.020]   - The tweet or the video?
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:49.860]   The both.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.660]   "I'm retiring from all competitive chess events.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.260]   My preparation is outmatched.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.580]   My calculation skills are too flawed.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.180]   And most importantly, my anxiety is beyond repair.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:06.220]   I physically and emotionally cannot do it anymore."
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.580]   What was the hardest thing?
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.180]   What was the hardest thing about competing?
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.380]   Like, can you elaborate on that?
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:18.380]   - Yeah, I think it's separated into phases of my life.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.780]   So after being a creator and coming back
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.660]   and playing over the board
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.460]   and making recaps of all my games,
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:30.340]   I think the constant feeling that I had at the board
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.420]   was a kid who hadn't studied enough for a test,
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.580]   which is a very unique type of anxiety.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:42.180]   And during the game, it was just self-hatred.
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:46.380]   Like, good moves did not feel as good
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:50.060]   as how bad bad moves felt and bad moments.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.420]   - And underneath that, you're saying there's a sense
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.900]   that I did not prepare well enough.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:56.100]   - Unquestionably.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.580]   So I'm an international master,
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:03.660]   but there's international masters now who are 11.
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:08.460]   I got the title when I was 22, which is late.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.900]   That might not sound like it's late, but it's really late.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.940]   And I quit chess multiple times when I was a teenager.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.180]   If I hadn't, one of my parents was like,
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:19.540]   "Sit down, this is the only thing that you're good at.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.220]   "Focus on it."
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.580]   Maybe I would have been a grandmaster,
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.220]   but that's life, right?
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.260]   And I would come back to chess at various points in my life
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.060]   when I felt more mature, I felt more ready,
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.300]   and I felt more motivated.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.180]   It was all me.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.900]   I never, I had one coach when I was maybe about 10,
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.220]   I never listened to the guy, great guy.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.700]   He emailed me even recently, just wanting to catch up,
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.180]   which I thought was adorable 'cause I don't even know
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.140]   if he knows that YouTube chess exists.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.420]   He's in his 70s, he's just like a nice older guy.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.460]   And he would come to my house, we would have dinner,
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.460]   my grandma would make us food,
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.660]   and he would tell her that I'm brilliant, but I never work.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.980]   And I have so much potential.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:03.160]   If only I ever worked at all, one minute on anything.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.380]   I just played speed games online and I--
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.340]   - Did he speak the truth there?
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.180]   Like, could you have worked more?
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.460]   - I could have worked more, for sure, yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.660]   - When you listen to Magnus, who doesn't,
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:16.580]   he seems like he doesn't work either.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.940]   - He works.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.580]   He might work in different ways, but I think for him,
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   it's also obsession, again, love, it's everything.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.820]   He might read a book, he doesn't consider it work.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.540]   It's work, he's getting information in
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.980]   and he's learning something.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.860]   It might just be easier for him to learn
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:37.860]   than for me, for example, or for anybody.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.900]   Just everybody learns and absorbs things differently.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.260]   So I would come back to chess,
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.900]   and the best run of my life that I had was in 2016,
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:50.380]   where I basically, while teaching a chess program,
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.020]   scholastic chess program, I told all the parents,
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.940]   "Hey, so for these four months,
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.380]   "I'm gonna stop doing private lessons,
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.020]   "and I'm gonna go travel and play tournaments
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.440]   "because I wanna become an international master finally.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.260]   "I'm 20 years old, this is in 2016.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.620]   "Like, can you help me raise some money?"
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.060]   These are all managing directors, these are lawyers,
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:12.100]   these are seven-figure, eight-figure households.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.900]   And they contributed, and I kept a blog,
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.940]   and then I worked just six hours, seven hours, every day,
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.380]   like studying all the opening trends,
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.360]   all of the new ideas, reading the books,
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.660]   analyzing my own games, playing my own speed games
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.460]   and analyzing them, training every day.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   And that year, I went from 2240 over the board to 2404,
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.700]   with two of the three norms, as they call them,
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.220]   which are basically tournament performances.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.700]   Like you perform at a certain level, not too complicated.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.320]   So I got almost everything I needed to be an IM.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.780]   But I just slipped up at the very end,
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:52.020]   and 2017, I didn't play chess, but in 2018,
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.660]   I came back once again with a vengeance,
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.980]   I started playing in the summer once again,
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.320]   and I went up, up, up to my peak.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.660]   But then, something interesting happened.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.980]   My life mission was accomplished.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:07.460]   I never wanted or thought I could be a grandmaster.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.380]   - Yeah.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.980]   - I wanted to be an international master.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.820]   And the adrenaline dump of hitting the IM title,
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.180]   I just stopped working completely.
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.460]   I just completely stopped working.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:22.040]   I couldn't, and the second I started falling,
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.780]   I couldn't stop.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.780]   And I spent the rest of the summer just tanking,
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.420]   and I said, "Ah, fuck this, I made my IM,
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.780]   "I'm gonna fuck off someplace and whatever.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.380]   "I'll be IM, it doesn't matter."
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.740]   But when I play games online,
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.260]   I mean, I destroy grandmasters all the time.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.380]   Like, dynamically, dynamics in chess
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.900]   are just complex positions with all sorts of calculation,
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.020]   attacking, defending, like very forcing lines.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.740]   I think it's my best strength.
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:56.260]   I think I'm easily grandmaster level.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.660]   - So you have the capacity to be grandmaster?
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.500]   - 100%.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.780]   Like, if I--
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.260]   - If the work was put in.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.480]   - If the work was put in,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.780]   and I was not doing my current career,
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.600]   if I just trained full-time, I think I could do it.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.080]   - Do you have a desire to be a grandmaster?
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.000]   Did you have a desire?
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.380]   You said, "I didn't really want,"
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:18.240]   like, the main goal was international master,
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.120]   which, by the way, is really interesting.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.600]   Just, I've talked to Olympic athletes,
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.080]   the crash after the gold medal is fascinating.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.760]   - Yeah, I didn't get gold, but for me, that was my goal.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.120]   - That was your goal, I mean, it doesn't matter.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.280]   It's the goal.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.900]   It takes a very, very special person
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.900]   to not be destroyed by the gold and continue the dominance.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.040]   It's to continue growing, to continue,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.680]   I mean, it's hard to, that's why they talk about,
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.040]   it's hard to be a champion and defend your championships,
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.400]   or whatever the goal is, to achieve the goal
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.040]   and stick to, like, yeah.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.240]   - Yeah, it broke me.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.080]   - It broke you.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:12:59.900]   - Yep.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.720]   - So you have the capacity to be a grandmaster.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.960]   Have you ever thought, by the way,
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.480]   is there still possible for you,
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.560]   or are you fully dedicated now
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.800]   to the love of creating and analyzing this game?
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.900]   - I don't think I'm going to do what I do right now forever.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.840]   So--
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.520]   - Well, you're gonna die one day, just a heads up.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.440]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.960]   I once cried when I realized that.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   It was at a funeral.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.280]   It was very sad.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.680]   That's another entirely separate rabbit hole to go down.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.280]   - Which is when--
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.120]   - When did this happen?
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:30.940]   - Yeah.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.040]   - It was like, years ago.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:32.880]   Yeah, it was rough.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.120]   - So you really were able to, like,
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.640]   like that realization really hit you,
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.400]   like, fuck, this ends.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.680]   - Yeah, I'm the kind of person who,
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.880]   I have my active thoughts in my brain
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.040]   of things I have to get done,
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.480]   and the more of those, the better,
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.000]   'cause my brain will walk me off a cliff,
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.600]   not the physical body,
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.560]   the brain itself will walk off a cliff,
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.440]   spinning in circles.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.720]   So I try to keep myself as active as possible
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.900]   on tasks I have to do.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.740]   It's good, and I'm busy.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.600]   It's good I'm at the scale I am,
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.940]   'cause you can't really rest a whole lot,
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.180]   but yes, that was,
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.420]   I have these moments in my life
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.580]   where I have realizations of past fuck-ups,
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.100]   or things I really have to do
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.540]   that I've been really doing poorly,
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.860]   or things like this,
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.860]   massive existential things that just hit me like a bus.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.780]   - There's several things tricky about it,
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.700]   'cause I meditate on death a lot.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.140]   Like, in this conversation,
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.700]   I imagine this is the last thing both you and I do,
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700]   just, we're gonna die after this.
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.140]   So you meditate on that.
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.180]   But then you also have to,
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.420]   I think what hits people really hard
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.140]   is the realization that life moves on.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.860]   Not only does it just end for you,
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.040]   but most people will be like,
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.100]   they'll, in your case, they'll tweet.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.580]   It's like, oh, he's so great.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:57.260]   There'll be so much outpouring.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.420]   There'll be outpouring of love and so on for a day,
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.700]   and then it moves on.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.760]   And the new trees grow,
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.420]   new bridges are built,
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.580]   and then eventually human civilization ends,
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.420]   or moves over to Mars and so on,
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.840]   and you'll be forgotten completely.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.180]   But that, for most people, will come right away.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.820]   Like, you get a cancer diagnosis or something like that,
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.940]   and it's like, doesn't anyone else know
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.100]   that I'm going to die?
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.940]   Does anyone else care?
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.940]   Like, nobody gives a shit.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.140]   I mean, they do.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:31.300]   I mean, there's love there,
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.920]   but not in a dramatic way
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.940]   that you would somehow deep inside hope for,
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.340]   that the world would stop
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:41.980]   because your life is facing this catastrophic event.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:45.180]   But I think ultimately,
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.180]   what you could channel that realization
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.660]   into appreciation of the current moment,
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.060]   it's just the people you love,
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:56.020]   and sharing love with them as intensely as possible,
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.900]   experiencing every moment as intensely as possible,
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.460]   'cause eventually there'll be a last moment,
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.340]   and after that, there'll be no more moments.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:05.860]   - That's sort of what I do.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.500]   Yeah, I try to channel all of that into,
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.940]   sorry, I don't use these fancy microphones in my own--
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:15.260]   - You look uncomfortable.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.100]   It's not your fault.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:16.940]   It's not your fault, Levy.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.780]   - With this microphone?
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.380]   - No, with this line of conversation.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.220]   - Oh.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.980]   - I'm playing therapist.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.580]   - I don't know if I'm uncomfortable.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.220]   I just, I don't know if I have a lot to say.
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.860]   Sometimes I just listen.
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:31.700]   - Yeah.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.100]   - Like sometimes I'm intimidated.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:33.940]   - It's not your fault.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.760]   - You say a lot of good things,
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.060]   and I'm like, shit, what am I gonna say at the end of it?
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.900]   - Yeah.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.460]   (laughing)
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.100]   - On this subject especially, I'm like,
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:42.940]   that's sort of what I--
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.100]   - There's nothing.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.700]   What do you think happens after we die?
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.580]   - Oh, man.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.500]   - No, that's a rhetorical question.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.340]   What were we talking about?
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.020]   Grandmaster.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.100]   Grandmaster.
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.900]   So how hard is it to reach?
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.700]   What are the requirements for Grandmaster, by the way?
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.100]   'Cause, yeah, and what are the requirements
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.220]   for International Mastery?
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.900]   You mentioned a few requirements and so on.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.260]   - Yes, so the first one is you have to know
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.700]   how to use a Shure mic and an arm.
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.540]   I'm slowly learning.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.260]   - You were impressed by the Shure microphone, by the way.
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:16.260]   For people listening, we're using this Shure SM7B
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:19.500]   that a lot of podcasters use.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.700]   I don't know why, and Michael Jackson on Thriller,
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.740]   which Grimes told me.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.580]   - Really?
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.420]   - That's why.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.240]   I think it looked a little different,
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.020]   but it's the same underneath it.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.620]   A few musicians used it in studio.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.780]   I don't know where it became popular
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.700]   as a podcasting microphone, 'cause I think
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.100]   most broadcasters use condenser mics
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.540]   that look really fancy.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.020]   This looks a little--
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.420]   - No, this one's great.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.700]   It sounds really, really good.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.220]   And I told you before that I wanted to use it,
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.980]   but it requires an external dashboard of some sort,
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.620]   and I'm way too lazy to learn how to do it.
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:58.220]   And my microphone doesn't sound that bad
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.140]   for YouTube and for Twitch, but this is a long-term--
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.300]   - I still have to figure out how to stream stuff.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.060]   I haven't figured that out.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.100]   - You want to go down into the world of Twitch?
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:07.940]   - No, I don't.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:11.100]   - Okay, you just want to learn how to do it, just in case.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.500]   - No, for, no, not Twitch.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.700]   (laughing)
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.900]   - Do you know what we have over there?
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.820]   - So first of all, yes, it's like,
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.900]   I feel like "The Hobbit" going into "Mortar."
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.020]   Yeah, Twitch is a very intense world.
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:32.700]   But there is useful cases when you should have
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:37.420]   your microphone work with the different,
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:40.740]   the processing chain work in real time,
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.860]   so you can do interviews.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.220]   And also, I try to play a video game once a month.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.620]   So I've done that like three times already.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:55.420]   So stream that kind of stuff for like an hour.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.500]   Like play "Skyrim."
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.900]   I love playing "Skyrim."
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.740]   I actually love the idea, I haven't done that yet,
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.780]   but apparently in "Skyrim" you can turn off the monsters
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.020]   and you can just walk around.
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.700]   So I love the idea of just walking around
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.740]   in "Skyrim" for a couple hours.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.740]   And just like, 'cause it's beautiful nature.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.580]   - I see.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.100]   - Do you know anything about those?
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:15.940]   It's the other sponsor.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.020]   - I know little about "Skyrim."
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.020]   - So it's kind of like, no.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.100]   Yeah, it's just beautiful worlds.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:30.100]   So there's games that are able to create this sense of,
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.300]   you know, the way you feel when you go hiking,
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.380]   a sense of nature.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.140]   It's not that they're ultra realistic,
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:40.020]   but they capture some majestic aspect of nature.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:43.100]   I think some of it is also music, something peaceful.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.980]   It's like old-timey medieval type of music.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:51.740]   And just the trees, like the wind, like (whooshing)
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.300]   and you could, and then there's,
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.020]   in the distance there's the mountains.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.940]   And you can like, you have a sense of history
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:01.500]   that the nature gives you.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.940]   You have a sense of space, like this,
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.620]   you're like this tiny little creature
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.620]   and there's this big world all around you.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.660]   I don't know how, that's like an art
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.980]   for a video game to create that.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.980]   It's not just about the monsters in front of you.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:16.420]   It's about this world and this feeling of a world.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:19.060]   So I can just walk around and enjoy it.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.140]   - I get asked this question a lot.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.380]   Why don't I stream more video games?
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.220]   - Yes.
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:26.860]   - And I didn't know that such video games,
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:27.740]   first of all, existed.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.940]   I thought it was mostly just various sci-fi-ish characters
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.100]   and shooting and objective.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.300]   - Oh, Call of Duty, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.820]   - I've played Overwatch on stream.
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:38.860]   It's the only video game I actually played a lot
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:39.980]   and got decent at.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.620]   And I couldn't play it on stream anymore
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.100]   because my teammates would use racial slurs
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.820]   in the voice chat.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:46.660]   - Yeah.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.260]   - So that is--
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.940]   - I will, one of the, 'cause I've been thinking
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:54.940]   of talking to a few streamers and they do,
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:58.500]   they're a little bit, I don't know as far as,
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.940]   that community broadly does use racial slurs
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.560]   and seem to make them okay.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:08.380]   But for the ones I would talk to are a little bit,
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.180]   they're just harsh in general
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.700]   in the intensity of language.
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.300]   And I don't know what to do.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.740]   Like, I don't wanna be the guy who says,
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:20.740]   kids these days with their mean language on the internet.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.100]   You wanna kind of adapt to the different communities.
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:29.100]   But at the same time, there's lines that you can cross.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:32.960]   Right, like if you make everything into a joke,
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:35.060]   because that's what they kinda do.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.780]   Everything ends in LOL, everything is funny.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:38.620]   - Yeah.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.620]   - That becomes, once again, a lubricant.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.980]   That it's like a slippery slope that takes you to a place
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.980]   where you actually make pretty mean ideas,
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:58.500]   even evil ideas okay, because it started as a joke.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.580]   And so, I mean, you start getting into the territory of,
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.340]   I mean, because I've been reading a lot on Hitler
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.060]   and Stalin and so on, and you'll see those kinds
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.740]   of topic come up in that community.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:12.060]   And it's like, ooh, they have a very different perspective
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.420]   on that stuff.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.140]   To them, it's just a fun joke, fun time.
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.060]   And I see that the conscious of that with Call of Duty,
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:24.060]   where you're shooting, and I love shooting
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.140]   and killing things in video games.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.900]   But there's a slippery slope there too,
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:33.260]   because then just having visited the front in Ukraine,
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.180]   you get to see the real killing of people.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.180]   And you see how one can lead to another.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:45.180]   It's non-obvious, but there's something that happens
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:50.180]   in video games where you're like, well, this is not reality.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.140]   The same kind of things happens in war.
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.260]   Well, the people on the other side aren't really human.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.620]   It does become a kind of video game.
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.620]   And that same mechanism, I feel like I wanna be cautious
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.780]   about our brain going down that road.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:10.620]   So yeah, I do worry about that community.
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:14.820]   But there are video games that don't have
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.020]   such communities around them.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.020]   I think Skyrim, I don't think Skyrim
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.620]   is an online component of people.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:22.460]   - Minecraft, I think is relatively civil,
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.700]   from what I've seen.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:24.780]   - Interesting. - Good community.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.820]   I think it's a lot of, right now it's booming.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.580]   It's a lot of young creators
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.980]   who are all seemingly quite close.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:36.980]   And I think the community then extends to social media.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:40.860]   Some of them are intense, but who isn't?
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.300]   And I think they foster a more or less
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.460]   kind of good group of folks.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:48.540]   But no, I completely agree.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:49.620]   I think a lot of that stuff,
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.540]   and combined with the anonymity stuff
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:54.460]   that we mentioned earlier, totally dehumanizes
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.900]   the way people interact with each other.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.740]   And it's scary.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:01.420]   I don't know.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:02.580]   Combine that with two years
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.220]   of some people barely going outside.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.780]   - Yeah, with COVID, yeah.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.740]   - It's not a good mix.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:08.700]   It's not a good mix at all.
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.460]   - I mean, you'd like to think that folks,
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.100]   it's like in their teenage years,
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.460]   kind of go through those and they mature out of it and stuff.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:19.820]   So they start to realize the weight of their words.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.020]   Like, that's my hope.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.820]   But we're all trying to figure that out,
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:24.820]   how the internet has changed youth.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.820]   Like easy access to porn,
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:30.900]   easy access to like some dark communities
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:34.820]   where dark ideas breed.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.180]   I don't know.
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.060]   But then again, I trust in the goodness
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.060]   and the intelligence of people at the end of the day.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.020]   And I think kids will,
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.820]   now I sound like an old man,
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:47.380]   but it's good for kids to play with different ideas
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.540]   and then they grow out of it, hopefully.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.340]   But then you have to have parents and good school
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.420]   and like good friends that kind of call them out
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:54.620]   and they're bullshit.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.460]   You need that.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.260]   If you're stuck inside under anonymity,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.940]   maybe you don't have some of those signals.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:03.780]   Kids these days with their internet.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.980]   - I had to go through this.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.700]   It's kind of what I mentioned.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.900]   So I didn't have two divorced, my parents were divorced.
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.940]   I didn't have two households.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.220]   I had three.
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.740]   So I had-- - What was the third one?
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.380]   - So I went to school most of my childhood
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:21.500]   in a town where my grandmother lived.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.100]   And she was kind of like the Switzerland.
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:28.100]   So I would be with her and my mom would come with me there,
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:32.580]   half the week, dad would take me to his place
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.340]   for the other half of the school week.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.580]   And my parents would split weekends.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.460]   My mom's weekends were in New York
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.860]   where my stepdad was and that family.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.180]   So three houses.
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.660]   - So grandma, your dad, mom and then mom.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:49.460]   - So step siblings there and there,
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.180]   new people there and there,
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:53.020]   extended family there and there.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.820]   And also at grandma's where I would come
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.180]   anytime I had a conflict.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:57.980]   And when I was 12 and 13
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:59.700]   and being just a total lunatic,
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.540]   emotional manipulator of all folks in my family,
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.540]   I was just teenager rebelling
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.540]   and also having to deal with three different households.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:09.540]   And I mean, I carried a backpack,
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:10.740]   the same backpack, literally,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.780]   that I not the physical one,
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:15.200]   but what's inside of it that I carried.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.420]   Like when I came here to record the episode
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.860]   and have my stuff in the hotel,
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.260]   a backpack with a laptop, a bunch of clothes,
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.860]   a bunch of other things that I need throughout the week,
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.180]   deodorant, things like that.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.900]   I mean, of course you start getting that stuff
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.220]   in all the houses,
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.900]   but that was the way I lived
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.420]   for some of the most important developmental years
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.460]   of my life.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:40.460]   And who knows if I had too much of what we're describing,
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.300]   one sprinkle of this too much,
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:43.220]   one sprinkle of this too much,
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.380]   if I had someone influence me in a negative way.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.500]   Luckily, I managed to steer clear of a lot of it.
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.940]   And--
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:53.620]   - Yeah, how did you not get into trouble with the internet?
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:54.900]   Meaning like, how did you--
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.740]   - I don't know.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.180]   - What was your experience with the internet?
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.900]   So I was--
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.740]   - Having to move a lot,
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.380]   having to have multiple households,
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:06.820]   just psychologically difficult upbringing.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:09.820]   - I, yeah, it was extremely tough.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.700]   It's hard to speak about it now
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.580]   because I'm in a completely different mental state.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.980]   I don't even remember some of like those moments, but--
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.140]   - It's almost like a different person.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.220]   - Yeah, that's exactly how it feels.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.820]   But I remember I had a big video game addiction,
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:26.540]   just like most teenagers.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.580]   I wanna say teenagers, but probably teenage boys,
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.900]   but I'm not, I don't know.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:33.860]   I don't know how addicted teenage girls are to video games.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.620]   - Yeah, I didn't get on that.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.340]   - I definitely look back on things that I did
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.980]   in certain instances, like,
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.460]   while I was a teenager, that was stupid.
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.340]   Oh, I scammed somebody in some video game.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.340]   Oh, that was, you know, that was, oh, that's hilarious.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.540]   Like, and just, I was just an idiot teenager.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.180]   Like, I didn't do anything unforgivable, luckily.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.820]   And for the most part, just kinda went about my life.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:04.740]   And I somehow got older
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.780]   and started getting more independent
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.660]   and stopped playing video games.
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.820]   And to be honest with you, I would love to sit here
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.740]   and say I have some sort of logical explanation
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.740]   of why I am the person I am today.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:20.060]   But I think you need elements of the right upbringing
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.460]   and support system, as you said, and you also need luck.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:26.540]   You just, I've been in some situations as a teenager
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:29.540]   where I almost got, I almost got killed
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.260]   by some gang members.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.620]   That's a very exaggerated story,
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.700]   but I was in a park in New York City
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.900]   and I got into it with a kid whose brother
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.780]   was in a notorious gang of that neighborhood.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.380]   And he told me his brother was gonna come
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:46.380]   and kill me, basically, over a stolen basketball.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.700]   And I was gonna fight this kid 'cause I was 14.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.740]   You know, he stole my basketball.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.780]   Of course I'm gonna fight this kid.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.060]   This kid was like 12, he had a pierced tongue.
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:53.900]   - Yeah.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:55.340]   - Like, this wasn't a joke.
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:56.180]   (laughs)
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.020]   - Yeah.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.740]   - This kid was from a totally different way of life.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.860]   And his brother did show up,
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.420]   but his brother was like, "I'm not gonna look at this kid."
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.900]   I was a little teenager, I wasn't a big,
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.260]   now 14-year-olds are six feet tall,
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.940]   maybe something would have happened to me.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.500]   But I was a little kid.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:10.540]   And his brother was like, "Bro."
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.460]   But looking back at that is crazy
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:15.260]   because I definitely had some of these moments
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.180]   in New York City more than anywhere else
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.100]   'cause it's such a big place.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.860]   But luck, you need some luck.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.140]   - Yeah, it's kind of funny that there's certain moments
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:27.220]   in life on which the entire trajectory of your life can turn.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.060]   - Yeah.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.220]   - And then they're all, like, in that case, nothing happened.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.060]   But, you know, I most intensely feel this
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.980]   when I get almost run over by a car kind of thing.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.700]   - How many times have you almost get run over?
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.900]   - I don't know, maybe happened like twice in my life.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.740]   - Oh, okay.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:43.580]   - That kind of stuff.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.300]   Like when somebody runs a red light.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.140]   - Yeah.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.980]   - That happened to me here in Austin.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:50.820]   You realize, oh shit, that was,
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.980]   like your life flashes before your eyes.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:56.980]   And those moments can turn.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:59.780]   And then there's more meeting certain people
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.700]   where you meet them and for the positive,
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:06.700]   they're like, "Wow, this moment of inspiration,
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.340]   "like, wow, this is possible.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:11.420]   "Wow, this kind of person can exist.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.620]   "Maybe I can be that kind of person too."
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.420]   So yeah, those things can, like, change the direction.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.260]   But maybe not, maybe they just reveal something
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.660]   that was already there and the momentum
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.740]   is always carrying you forward into a thing
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.860]   that you are always gonna end up in.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.180]   Yeah, I wonder about that.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:29.380]   Speaking of teens doing stupid things,
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.620]   let's return to the Magnus Hans saga.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:33.700]   - I know, yeah.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:36.260]   - How did it start?
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:38.100]   Who is Hans Nieman?
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.660]   Who is Magnus Carlsen?
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:40.500]   How did it start?
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:41.700]   There's three games.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.740]   It started in Miami.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:46.020]   - Yeah, a good background story is Magnus Carlsen
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.060]   is the arguable greatest player of all time.
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:51.580]   Very close, I would say, to Garry Kasparov,
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.980]   world number one for now over 10 years.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.620]   - At the top of his game, you think?
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.860]   Like, close to the top of his game right now?
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.900]   - After the most recent thing, yes.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:05.180]   I think he has the uncanny ability of top athletes
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.780]   to absorb the bullshit and show,
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:11.500]   "Oh yeah, dad's home now."
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.620]   You know?
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:15.900]   "Run, I was only trying 70% before that."
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:16.740]   You know?
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.660]   And I think that's what he,
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.900]   I really think that's what he showed.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:19.740]   I was in awe.
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.180]   If Magnus is playing in a tournament,
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.700]   yes, it's good for views to put him in my YouTube thumbnails
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.140]   and make the video title about him
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.700]   if he does something brilliant,
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.420]   but I was legitimately just blown away.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:32.540]   It wasn't even, wasn't farming him for content.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.900]   This is unbelievable what he's doing to people.
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.140]   And he has a point to prove.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:41.420]   Hans is a, I believe he's 19 years old right now.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.180]   He's an American.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:45.220]   I don't know if prodigy is necessarily the right word.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.140]   Prodigies, you know they're prodigies
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.580]   from very, very young.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:52.300]   You don't, in chess, you don't become a prodigy at 18,
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:55.340]   but he was always a good junior player.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.900]   He was always a very unique character.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.820]   Like, I met Hans when he was 11, 12 years old.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:01.940]   He was this little kid,
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:04.980]   just trash talking folks at the Marshall Chess Club.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.140]   And he already had a reputation, literally.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.820]   Like, he had a reputation with counselors,
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:12.340]   with like, and the truth is I was similar.
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.540]   I was kicked out of chess camp
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:16.100]   by one of the best chess grandmasters of all time,
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.260]   Artur Yusupov.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.660]   I was in a chess camp when I was nine years old.
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:19.620]   - What'd you do?
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:20.580]   - I was just an asshole.
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.140]   - Yeah. - I was too strong.
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:24.340]   So I helped other people with all their work.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.260]   I was loud. - And you let your ego shine.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.140]   - I was a kid.
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.300]   I mean, I wouldn't.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.220]   - Well, you know, not every kid lets their ego shine,
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.660]   but some do. - Oh, yes.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.580]   - You did?
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:35.220]   Hans does, there's interviews when he's young.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.540]   - Yeah. - Where like,
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.500]   he's kinda talking shit. - Yes.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.420]   - But it's entertaining.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.900]   - Yes, what I try to stay away from is just,
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.220]   yes, I let my ego shine,
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.380]   but I don't think I even knew what any of that was
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.220]   when I was younger.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:48.060]   Yeah, so it's just sort of,
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:50.700]   I was just a loud, boisterous kid from a household
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:51.860]   where I wasn't paid attention to,
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.020]   'cause I had three of them.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.660]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:55.500]   - So I just was like,
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.340]   here's where I'm gonna show up and get my attention.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.860]   And Artur Yusupov, he's a great, great man.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.900]   I drove that man crazy.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.220]   He was like, top five in the world at some point
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:04.500]   in the '80s and '90s.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.180]   He said, "It's either me or this kid."
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.780]   - Oh, wow, so you really got to him.
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.500]   - Yes, he said, "I'm not gonna come back and teach camps
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:11.340]   "unless it's me."
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.540]   And I remember going through this.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:14.740]   I have very vague, distant memories of this.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.020]   My dad calling, apologizing.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.860]   - Yeah, did it make you feel good
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:20.340]   that you got to a grandmaster?
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:21.500]   - No, I felt horrible.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.380]   I felt guilty.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.140]   I felt guilty my whole life about that.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.980]   I very rarely feel proud of bad things
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:28.020]   or I showed them.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.180]   Even things, it gets to the point
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.100]   you feel guilty about things you didn't do.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:34.680]   That's when your brain really goes crazy.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.660]   - Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:41.180]   So, okay, so you can relate to Hans.
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:42.500]   - Yes, to young Hans.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:47.500]   And he was in and out of chess.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.980]   This is what I remember.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:51.060]   He was around the rating of 2300.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.620]   And I remember looking at some of his games
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.420]   in a tournament in Philadelphia.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:59.340]   And I was like, there was some game that he played
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:00.380]   and he didn't know the opening.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:03.220]   It was a London, which is a very popular opening,
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.060]   some theoretical line.
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:06.820]   I looked at it and I'm like, "Whoa, he didn't know that?
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.180]   "Okay, that's crazy."
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.740]   And then I just kind of walked by.
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:11.860]   And I saw him in a tournament a few months later
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.500]   and he did something very rare
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.480]   where in an open tournament,
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.660]   not a tournament of 10 players
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:17.680]   where everybody plays everybody,
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.280]   open tournament, randomized pairings,
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.340]   depending on how many points you have,
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.260]   he played nine grandmasters, which is crazy.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.420]   That means he was performing so well, so consistently.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.580]   That was where he got his first IM norm.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.420]   It's like, oh, here it is.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:31.520]   Here comes that like boom of a young player
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.060]   where he gets mature, he gets back into the game
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.980]   and he gets stronger.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:39.020]   I don't follow a whole lot, pandemic happens.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   And he starts streaming a bit and he's boisterous.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:47.180]   He's kind of like loud, he's talking trash
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:50.020]   and he's gaining rating constantly.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.520]   But so are a lot of people.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.380]   So you don't think much of it.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.740]   And then now you can go play over the board again,
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:57.260]   live tournaments, face-to-face,
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.980]   as opposed to online events.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.660]   And he's like, "I'm gonna go to this tournament.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:01.620]   "I'm gonna win it.
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.820]   "I'm gonna get my last GM norm."
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.260]   And he does.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.400]   And then he's like, "All right, my goal is this rating.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.980]   "By the end of this year."
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:09.820]   He gets it.
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.820]   He just demolishes absolutely everybody.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.500]   And you're like, "This guy's for real."
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.620]   - Over the board? - Over the board.
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.460]   Like, "This guy's for real."
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.500]   There's a lot of people like that.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.640]   If you look at the top juniors of the world, it's crazy.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.940]   Ali Reza Farooja, 2,800.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.440]   Vincent Khymer, 2,700.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.140]   A bunch of kids from India, 2,700.
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.940]   - Similar age or younger usually?
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.300]   - One or two years younger,
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:31.180]   maybe a little older by a year.
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.980]   But it's just this wave and you're just hype for the guy.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.300]   Like, "This is fucking awesome.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.740]   "We got a young American guy who shit talks
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.260]   "every time he's on camera
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:41.760]   "and he beats everybody he plays."
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.860]   But then you start hearing sprinkles here and there,
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:46.820]   maybe in some stream.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:51.540]   "Oh, I think he doesn't get to play on chess.com anymore."
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.660]   Like, chess.com doesn't put that badge there
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.140]   on the account sometimes.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.900]   Sometimes they just tell the player, "Listen, we know."
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.300]   And the player's like, "All right, you got me."
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:01.140]   And that's it.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.460]   There's no conversation.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.660]   So there's like these sprinkles.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:06.980]   But people cheat online, especially when they're young.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:09.180]   It's very captivating.
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.420]   It's a very nice thing to do.
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.500]   - Just to be clear, I mean, just to make explicit
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:15.780]   that the accusation, and I think it's proven,
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.060]   but they're still being shady about it
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.500]   to the degree it's done,
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:24.060]   is that he cheated on chess.com when he was 12?
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.300]   - 12 and 16, that's what he said.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.140]   - That's what he said.
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.020]   - That's what he admitted to.
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:31.540]   But right now, chess.com put out a statement
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:34.460]   and now Magnus put out a statement as well saying,
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.940]   "We think it's more than that."
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.380]   - Yeah, I've talked to Danny
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.620]   'cause he wants to come on the podcast,
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.540]   which I'm actually kind of interested in.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.520]   I think he's a cool person.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:47.780]   And they're also doing some really interesting
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.320]   anti-cheating stuff, which to me,
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.620]   from an algorithmic perspective, is interesting.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:55.280]   But he is also the man.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.580]   Like, there's always, in every field,
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.020]   there's the institution.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.940]   So he represents the institution
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.780]   'cause chess.com is the institution.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:06.060]   It's like, in the Olympic, it's the IOC.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:10.300]   It's like, I have to be careful.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.180]   - And chessfide is the institution.
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:14.140]   - Fide, okay. - Yeah.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:16.220]   - But chess.com-- - They've outgrown,
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.500]   way more people actually know chess.com,
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.460]   way more people know me, way more people know Hikaru.
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:22.300]   It's one of the reasons that--
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:23.660]   - It's interesting where the power lays.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.380]   Who has the most power?
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:26.200]   Interesting.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.580]   - Yeah, chess.com has the most power?
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.540]   Which power? - Well, I don't know.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.220]   Maybe you and Hikaru would do.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.800]   - No, I'm--
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.320]   - To steer public opinion, you know?
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.060]   - That's a very good question.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.440]   I have to think with my evil cap now.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.500]   What would happen if--
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:44.080]   - I'd rather you have the evil cap than Hikaru
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.140]   'cause I feel like he would really,
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.900]   you know, the power absolute,
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.640]   if the two of you ruled the world, it'd be a problem.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.060]   - You mean side by side or rivals?
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:55.020]   - Yeah, it would be like, yeah,
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.940]   as rivals, there would definitely be a war.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:59.540]   It's one of the reasons I would not chess box him.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:03.660]   - Do you guys, how much do you like each other?
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.220]   I mean, do you admire each other as fellow--
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:08.660]   - I can tell you how I feel.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:10.820]   - As fellow entertaining--
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:12.460]   - Well, we should finish Magnus Hans.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:14.420]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:16.060]   - I know, I feel like just inside,
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:16.940]   we don't wanna talk about it
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.300]   'cause it feels like it's been talked about so much.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.140]   I'm trying to give--
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:23.020]   - No, for you, just remember, for me, it's much less.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:24.780]   - Yeah, and for the listener, it might be zero.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.300]   - For the listener, zero, yeah.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.140]   So--
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.020]   - Like Rogan asked me, like, so what's this?
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:30.980]   - I know, I heard him even talking.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.020]   - What's this chess?
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:34.540]   - You know, Joe talked about the Indonesia thing.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:35.380]   - Oh, he did?
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:37.300]   - In some super random small thing,
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:39.140]   and that was a very funny moment for me.
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:42.100]   - I told him about this drama a few weeks ago,
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:43.860]   and then he's like, yeah, this is interesting.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.500]   Is it anal beads, is that possible, is that good?
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.500]   I was like, yeah, I think it's possible.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.580]   I don't remember how drunk he was,
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:54.200]   but so even, you know, he's curious, he doesn't really know.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.540]   But anyway, cheating when he was 12, when he was 16.
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:00.860]   As he said, he admitted to cheating online
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.260]   when he was 12 and 16.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:05.780]   - Yes, but for timeline's sake, let's just do it this way.
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:07.620]   He has a lot of over-the-board success,
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.460]   but nobody really talks about the online cheating stuff.
[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:13.860]   It's sort of kind of kept low-key,
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.020]   couple hundred people, maybe a couple thousand people,
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.340]   which sounds like a lot, but it's not,
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.980]   'cause there's millions of viewers know about this.
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:21.760]   It's generally kept kind of low-key,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.720]   because historically, if you cheated online as a teenager,
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.980]   you're not cheating over-the-board.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.700]   It's not possible, you will get caught,
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:30.980]   nobody has ever attempted it.
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.820]   We've had over-the-board cheaters,
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.800]   but not at the ultra elite level.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.920]   And so what happens is, they play this tournament in Miami,
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.340]   and the first day, Hans loses three-nothing.
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:48.220]   This is important because on the very next day,
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:50.060]   it's not like Hans was destroying everything.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.640]   The second day of the tournament,
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:54.400]   he sits down game one versus Magnus,
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.120]   in their best of four, and destroys him.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.960]   Like, he destroyed him.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.600]   Made it look like I was playing in Magnus' shoes.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.880]   You know, the level difference,
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:07.040]   it went even, like, he wasn't close.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.520]   Of course, we can argue it might be because of the,
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.660]   maybe Magnus knew something ahead of time,
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.760]   there's obviously the psychological element,
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.600]   not important.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.820]   Hans leaves, they say, interviewer says,
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:22.660]   "Hans, yesterday,"
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.780]   by the way, horribly phrased interview question.
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:29.780]   He goes, "Hans, yesterday was terrible for you.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:33.100]   "And today you start with a masterpiece.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.020]   "What do you have to say?"
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.980]   Chess speaks for itself, walks away.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:39.740]   Argue, you can argue, it's cringe, you can argue,
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:40.740]   I thought it was cool.
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.340]   And then the guy then keeps asking a question
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.060]   with his arm extended, 'cause he's so shocked,
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:45.900]   he doesn't know what to do.
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.300]   Like, he didn't even occur to him,
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.360]   how ridiculous it looked to be asking.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.600]   And then not only does Hans come back
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.440]   and loses the best of four,
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.320]   he loses like two more games or maybe three,
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.980]   he had the thing, he lost the next three games.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:02.300]   He then proceeds to lose every single best of four match
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.900]   for the rest of the tournament.
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:07.220]   He ends with zero points and a prize money of $0.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:11.140]   They put up the graphic and he put Neiman zero.
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.120]   I think he got some minimum, right?
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.360]   So it's like, wow, this is like insane.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.040]   This guy comes out with this crazy interview.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.880]   And in my recap videos, I was like,
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.120]   the next time Hans has success,
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.480]   he has to stay away from the cameras.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.160]   Don't let him talk, just don't let him talk.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.000]   It's gonna be bad luck.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:25.820]   You know, I'm joking around,
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:28.040]   like next time he plays, it's crazy, he's gonna.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.300]   So that was their kind of first interaction there.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.560]   They also, there was some photos,
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.100]   they were having fun playing on the beach.
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:35.540]   I don't know why they had a chessboard on the beach.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:36.380]   Chess players are such-
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:37.200]   - Magnus and Hans?
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.040]   - Yeah, they were-
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:39.960]   - So they were still getting along.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.280]   - I guess so, yeah.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.120]   - It's interesting, 'cause I talked to him at that time.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.000]   Would he have mentioned something?
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:45.840]   - Right.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.920]   - That he would have said if I asked him about Hans,
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.320]   'cause that was clueless.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.720]   Did anyone care about Hans?
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.760]   - No, no, no.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.520]   - Hans is not a super known entity, right?
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.280]   He became much more known.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.640]   - He became probably a top five
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:01.240]   all-time popular chess player in the last three weeks.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.360]   - Yeah, so it's not,
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.760]   it wouldn't even be a worthy question.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.800]   - No, you don't know, maybe Magnus already kind of knew.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.120]   A lot of the top players, it seems,
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.760]   are coming out now and saying, we already were suspicious.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.160]   - It seems like Magnus might have known,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.920]   but maybe not enough to address it.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.000]   He still might not be willing to address it.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:21.920]   - Yes.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.560]   - But anyway, so yeah,
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.440]   so totally horrible tournament performance after-
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.600]   - Correct.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.840]   - After Hans beat Magnus.
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.760]   - Then the annual tradition
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.320]   of the St. Louis tournaments happens,
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.640]   which is a strong field of players
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.400]   first for a fast tournament, rapid and blitz,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.360]   and a classical tournament.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.200]   And the classical tournament is the Sinkfield Cup.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.200]   It's named after Rex Sinkfield,
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.160]   billionaire chess philanthropist.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.760]   - And it's like St. Louis Chess Club
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.600]   is like a prestigious place.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.440]   - It's this whole, yeah.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.960]   - And a host of a prestigious tournament.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.040]   - Hall of Fame is there for chess.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.640]   I don't know if it's US Hall of Fame
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.120]   or Worldwide Hall of Fame, but yeah, it's the tournament.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.560]   - Other countries play chess?
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:06.000]   - They do, but you know, we will,
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.080]   I don't know who determines
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.040]   where the Hall of Fame gets to be.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.940]   If we say it's the Hall of Fame, okay.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:12.760]   One day, some other part of the world's gonna be like,
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.400]   actually, it's over here.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.180]   So basically what happens is we have a field set
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:19.280]   for the Sinkfield Cup.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:22.600]   Set, it's the top 10 players in the world.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.760]   Some can't make it, so okay,
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.500]   you get number 11 in there or something.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.840]   One of them can't come
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.960]   because of something related to coronavirus.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.480]   Now we're gonna get a little asterisk on Spotify
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:35.680]   'cause it was mentioned.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.500]   Get more info about COVID-19.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.640]   So I don't know why he couldn't come, but he couldn't come.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:45.360]   Okay, something happens, he can't make it.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.880]   Hans Niemann is the replacement.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.040]   At the time, we didn't know this,
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.480]   but now weeks later, we knew Magnus wanted to not play.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:56.160]   This is very important.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:58.160]   Back then, we didn't know.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.680]   Apparently some other top players also didn't wanna play.
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:02.760]   They also were suspicious.
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:04.920]   They also wanted increased anti-cheating measures,
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.000]   which by the way in chess are dog shit.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.840]   Like you give this little metal wand
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.280]   and you put it on the little ears, the body,
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.480]   and there's apparently an argument
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.200]   a micro earpiece would not be caught,
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.440]   something in the armpit vibrating
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.400]   would not be caught, something in the shoe.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.880]   They don't make the players take their shoes off
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.920]   'cause it's too elitist.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.880]   How are you gonna make players take their shoes off?
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.440]   That's, oh my God.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:29.760]   But if these things are out there.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:32.900]   - Or if anything was inside any other orifice.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:33.960]   - Correct, yes.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.800]   - I have to bring that up.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.400]   - I mean, to be honest, yes, that is very truthful.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.960]   - If nothing else, this podcast is about honesty and truth.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.040]   So I have to be complete.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.600]   - Correct, and transparency.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.680]   So what ends up happening in the Singfield Cup
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.320]   is Magnus ends up still playing,
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.680]   but the anti-cheat measures are not introduced.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:54.920]   So the first few games,
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.360]   Hans has a very, very impressive first round game
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.400]   against Levon Oronian,
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.880]   one of the best players in the world.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:01.760]   Okay, draw.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.360]   He was pushing, draw.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.760]   Second game, demolishes like a top player.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.280]   Mamed Yaraf crushes him.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.880]   Dominant opening, but not like a perfect game.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.720]   You understand?
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:17.120]   He made some inaccuracies here and there,
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.520]   and he ended up winning in a complex game.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.600]   This game three happens versus Magnus.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   And not only does he beat Magnus with the black pieces,
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.160]   he dominates him from start to finish.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.400]   So in the opening, Magnus played something with white
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.880]   that he had maybe played once or twice before.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.200]   There was some big debate about it.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:43.240]   I'm not gonna get into it.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.680]   Basically a very niche, small thing
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.680]   that just he had never played in maybe a long game before
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.240]   with some sprinkled in venom that might get Hans off guard.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.360]   Hans proceeds to play like the first 15, 20 moves
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.160]   absolutely perfectly,
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.600]   and then converts the game into a slightly better end game
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.600]   and squeezes Magnus to death.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.280]   Basically beats Magnus with black,
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   which nobody had done in years,
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.000]   the same way Magnus would have beaten other players.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.760]   Then he goes and gives this interview,
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.240]   where he claims that he had looked at those first 15, 20 moves
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.080]   right before the game basically.
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:23.920]   He got lucky.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:26.760]   - Didn't he say he looked at something very similar?
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.480]   - No, no, it was either similar
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.520]   or literally that exact variation,
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.520]   which is possible.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.400]   I've done that before.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.600]   One of my best ones of my life.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.680]   That morning I went, you know, I'm not prepared.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.800]   What if my opponent plays this
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.480]   Queen's Gambit accepted variation?
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.520]   And I literally learned the first 12 moves.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.600]   He didn't know move 12.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.640]   I killed him.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.200]   Okay, like it just happens.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.040]   - Yeah.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.800]   - Unfortunately, when you combine that
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.840]   with other small elements of the interview,
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:54.040]   and now there's body language experts going all on this,
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.000]   it was odd.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.760]   - He gave an interview afterwards,
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.160]   explaining various details of the game.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.560]   - But not really explaining them.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:02.400]   That's the thing.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.640]   The standard chess player interview is you sit down
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:07.120]   and you go something about the opening,
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.160]   something about not,
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.960]   oh yeah, I looked at this right before the game.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.680]   And then you explain various symphonies
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.680]   and compositions of variations,
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.000]   things that went through your head,
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.840]   things you were evaluating.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:20.360]   But Hans's interviews are different.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:21.880]   So everything about him as a chess player
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:22.800]   already is different.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.960]   And his interviews are extremely strange
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.160]   and also different.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.120]   That's fine.
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.920]   But not when you combine it then with the world champion
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.720]   withdrawing right after you beat him
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.040]   and ghosting the entire chess world.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.560]   - Yeah, so there's, for people who haven't listened to it,
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.520]   there's a kind of sloppiness
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:47.760]   to the way he analyzes the game.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.520]   Like he's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:51.320]   Like it's very--
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.160]   - 'Cause it's very obvious.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.000]   Like what do you mean?
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:53.920]   Just completely winning here.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.000]   - Yeah, I'm completely winning here.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.080]   And it's like, yeah, I just played perfect.
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:58.920]   I played perfect.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.560]   Like there's a sense of like,
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:04.760]   but it also doesn't, for me, again,
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.240]   a very outside spectator,
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.280]   it doesn't raise any red flags.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.760]   That's just his personality.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.320]   He seems to really like to talk this way.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.200]   And plus this could be crazy.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.640]   But do you have a sense that he's more of an intuitive player
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.440]   versus like he's just not the kind of person
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.200]   that analyzes really well?
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.200]   Or is that a ridiculous notion?
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.720]   - Well, let's put it this way.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.080]   To succeed legitimately,
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.760]   because obviously this is a cheating scandal
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.720]   at the end of the day,
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.080]   at the 2750, 82800 level, the upper echelon of chess,
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:40.200]   you cannot be an intuitive player.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.320]   You can be a little bit more intuitive
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.480]   than a calculator and a concrete evaluator of positions.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.960]   Meaning if I give you five seconds to play a move,
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.320]   you're gonna choose the best move quickly.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.600]   Those people are generally better at fast time controls.
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.920]   But you have to be good at everything.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.280]   And what raised red flags in this interview
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.680]   was the fact that it was different
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.200]   than every other interview any human being ever gave
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.120]   at that level of chess,
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.600]   particularly after beating Magnus
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.040]   for the first time as a teenager,
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.480]   which is a very small group of people.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.680]   And so that's where it got weird.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.440]   And the very next day, Magnus withdraws from the event.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.840]   Chess World lights completely on fire for multiple weeks.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.680]   And--
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.240]   - He also tweets.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.720]   - Right, yeah, that was--
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.240]   - That's the resignation.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.560]   No, resignation--
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:34.560]   - The tweet was, "I'm withdrawing
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.680]   "from the tournament in St. Louis.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.880]   "I've always enjoyed playing here,
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.160]   "and I will in the future."
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.280]   And then it's a clip of Jose Mourinho.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:41.280]   "I cannot speak.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.600]   "I choose not to speak.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.720]   "If I speak, I'm in big trouble.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:44.920]   "I don't wanna be in big trouble."
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:45.760]   - Yeah.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.360]   - And that's when people,
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.600]   nuts, people said it's not even a cheating insinuation,
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.480]   which was one of the theories.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:55.120]   Another theory was someone in Team Magnus
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.240]   told Hans what Magnus was looking at.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.160]   And that's why Hans learned those first 15 moves,
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.480]   which is so fucking stupid
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.600]   because Magnus knows like five people.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.800]   Not in his life, but his team is five people.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.960]   - Yeah, it's very close to that group.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:12.400]   - Right, but to the outsider,
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.000]   that sounds like a very legitimate theory.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.760]   How else can you explain?
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.120]   Hans said he knew before the game what was gonna happen.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.080]   Magnus senses a mole he's not, no.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.320]   - By the way, just so I know,
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.680]   like if that was, forget the cheating aside,
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:30.520]   if you knew, doesn't matter how,
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:34.800]   the opening your opponent is going to do, they prepared,
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.520]   is that a significant help to you?
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.120]   - If that opening is ultra sharp
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.120]   and requires basically the game to be on a knife's edge,
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.940]   yes, meaning one mistake can be fatal.
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.720]   - 'Cause then you can look up what the engine says
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.000]   and you can-- - Yeah, you can know everything.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.360]   You can know all the possibilities.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.920]   So even if your opponent goes off that engine path,
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.800]   you will know how to punish it.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.640]   In this case, what happened basically
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.320]   was Magnus played a line
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:08.140]   that if completely optimally punished
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.960]   would have given Hans a slightly better position.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.160]   And that's what happened.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.440]   But then he also demolished him
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.040]   in that later phase of the game.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:22.840]   - Yes, and then, okay, so Magnus' designs go silent,
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:25.980]   the chess world goes crazy.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:30.120]   What else is interesting in that period of time?
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.560]   - Hans' fourth round game of that tournament,
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.000]   right after beating Magnus,
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.840]   was also just absolutely genius.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:41.560]   Just an absolutely brilliant game, which he failed to win.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.640]   But then after that game,
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:46.880]   he also gives once again another interview
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:49.440]   where he's like, "This game was absolutely genius.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.000]   I was just killing him from start to finish."
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.740]   And there was a moment he literally says,
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.760]   "Oh yeah, I just gave him a piece, like a full piece,"
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.400]   which is a substantial advantage to the other side.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   And he starts explaining why the position is winning,
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.320]   but in words, not in chess moves,
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.140]   not in specific concrete chess moves,
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:10.440]   which is the way you're supposed to
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.800]   if you understand the position, right?
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.880]   So now there's this new theory that's being cultivated.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.080]   The interviews are gonna be used as the evidence.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.720]   And beyond round four,
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:26.120]   he just played like a good grandmaster.
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.580]   And he lost two or three games, maybe two games,
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:33.120]   and he drew the rest, so he didn't win again.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.520]   Like he beat, the first two out of his first three games,
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.780]   he beat Mamid Yarev, he beat Carlsen.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:42.600]   And he also went on the attack himself.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:44.600]   That was when he publicly admitted to cheating
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.320]   in an interview that he gave to the St. Louis Chess Club.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:49.800]   That's when he said he has never cheated over the board.
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:53.200]   Then he said, "Chess.com has banned me
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.920]   from the Global Championship,"
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.920]   which is what I was invited to to play.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:59.600]   Privately, they banned me, they didn't even ban me publicly.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:04.320]   And then he said, "And Hikaru is on Twitch every day,
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.280]   saying things about me, this and that."
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:09.960]   And since then, nothing.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.760]   Tournament finishes somehow.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:13.480]   I don't know how we got to the end of the tournament.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.880]   I really thought that it was gonna get called off.
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:17.320]   But tournament ends.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.160]   Hans hasn't said anything since then.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:22.160]   - Has he still said, when was the last time he said that?
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.000]   - That was the last tweet that he sent, September 7th.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.160]   He said, "Hikaru wants to play the victim,"
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.280]   something like this.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.520]   - They faced each other again recently.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.920]   When was that, what was that about?
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.160]   - They played in the online event
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:39.500]   of this Meltwater Champions Chess Tour,
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:43.520]   which is a 16-player tournament
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.320]   where everybody plays everybody first.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:51.040]   And after 15 games, the top eight make a knockout bracket.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.820]   And Magnus played the game.
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:57.080]   There was obviously a lot of hype prior
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.920]   for what was gonna happen in this game.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.880]   Magnus plays one move and resigns.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:06.480]   Actually, I imagine he didn't wanna play one move.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.320]   I imagine he would have resigned the game
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.200]   as it was starting.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.480]   But I think some websites don't let you resign
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.760]   before you make one move,
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.760]   'cause then the game isn't counted.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.480]   So I think he didn't wanna play at all,
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:18.640]   but he played one move and that made it even more epic,
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:20.760]   I suppose, and he resigned.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.520]   And that was that.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:26.080]   - So you lose, that game counts, right?
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:26.920]   - Oh, game counts.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.560]   - You lose the rating.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.980]   - These online events, unfortunately,
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:33.000]   don't count for any sort of rating.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.680]   But on a tournament, yeah, you play one move, yeah.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.520]   - So he resigns.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.680]   And then how does the tournament still work out?
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.500]   Is the tournament already over?
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.800]   So he made the eight,
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:45.360]   as Magnus still made the top eight.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.040]   - It was round five, or like round six or something.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.720]   So it was halfway through the preliminary stage.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.100]   It affected his standings.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:54.540]   But then after resigning that game,
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:57.980]   Magnus finished first in the bracket,
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.160]   in the preliminaries, and then he won the entire event.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.280]   There was a chance that they were gonna meet in the final,
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.520]   but Hans lost in the first round
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.560]   against the Vietnamese strong player, Le Quang Liam.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.560]   And then Magnus gave a short interview
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.680]   to the live broadcast,
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.960]   where he said he would give a statement
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.800]   at the end of the tournament.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:17.620]   And then he did.
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:19.980]   He gave a statement at the end of the tournament.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:21.720]   And now here we are.
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:24.740]   The only other thing missing from this
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:29.740]   is the very intense scrutinization
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:33.700]   of all those over-the-board games that I mentioned earlier,
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.720]   that Hans dominated in.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:39.640]   So people are now going through all of his games
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.440]   that he played in tournaments,
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.920]   and they're analyzing them with engines,
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.680]   and they're saying he played exceptionally well.
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:48.120]   And the debate is, was he cheating,
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.680]   or was he way too good already, but underrated?
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:54.980]   Because he could have had incubated knowledge,
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:57.080]   so he could have not played for a couple of years,
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:00.360]   was 2,700 level, but was playing people who were 24, 2,500.
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:04.640]   - Well, well, over the board, I see.
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:07.080]   So not just over the board with the top level people
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:10.160]   like Magnus, but over the board in general.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.840]   - Yes, before he got a chance to play
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.960]   in these super tournaments against the best players
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.800]   in the world, he had to go to Europe.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.960]   He was the most active chess player in 2021.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.560]   - And he was quite dominant.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.600]   - Yes, I think he played more over-the-board games
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.920]   than any player in 2021 or 2022.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.280]   I think it's 2021.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:32.960]   And yes, I think his rise was steeper than everybody,
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:34.760]   maybe with the exception of, well,
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:37.240]   there was a Feruzza who got to 2,800.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.520]   - See, I'd like to believe, 'cause he talks about being very,
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.360]   he just became obsessed with chess.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.720]   I like stories like that.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.040]   I like stories of the underdog,
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.280]   especially with the scarlet letter
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.240]   of having been a cheater in the past.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:01.240]   I like the idea of somebody who is flawed psychologically
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:07.240]   and ethically and just a full fascinating personality.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.400]   And this somehow just becomes obsessed.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.320]   I mean, similar to Bobby Fischer,
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:14.920]   is also a tortured soul, also flawed,
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:17.480]   also just chaotic all over the place.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.080]   You could see Bobby Fischer being somebody
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:22.760]   that might cheat when he was 12 on online chess, right?
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.000]   - If it existed, yeah, actually,
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000]   I think in some podcasts, like small chess podcasts,
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.560]   I don't wanna, I like Ben Johnson,
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.520]   so I'm apologizing for calling it small,
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.800]   but compared to, let's say, Lex Fridman podcast, it's--
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:39.960]   - What's his podcast?
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.480]   - It's Perpetual Chess, it's kind of like--
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.200]   - Oh, I love Perpetual Chess.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:44.320]   Are you joking?
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.120]   - Really? - How dare you call, yeah.
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.560]   I'll show you, 'cause it does a lot of, it talks,
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:53.800]   it makes me feel special.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.920]   Let me see, where is it, Perpetual Chess?
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.760]   He does like improver series.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.680]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.400]   - Yeah, he's great, Ben, I forgot,
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.720]   I'm so horrible with names, his name is Ben, Ben Johnson?
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:07.160]   Yeah, it is Ben Johnson, that's right.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:08.840]   Yeah, the Perpetual Chess podcast.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.180]   - That's amazing, see, Lex, when,
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:14.920]   even individuals like myself who might have a large audience
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.880]   when I look at you, you're just at a different level.
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:21.240]   I don't expect you to be listening to chess podcasts,
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.360]   just imagine you're doing something to change the world
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.960]   or talking to some visionary people.
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:29.760]   - Well, I should say, I've been running a lot
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.160]   and I listen to podcasts a lot because they're such,
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:38.040]   I love human beings excited about stuff,
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.160]   that really energizes me,
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.320]   and I've listened to a bunch of chess podcasts,
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:46.240]   I'm really energized by your love of chess.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.280]   I really like, yeah, sorry, I did forget his name,
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.480]   but Ben Johnson, I love it when he talks to grandmasters,
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:55.480]   I love it when he talks to the regular folks
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:59:00.640]   for the improvers, to see how they balance life in chess
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.800]   and all that kind of stuff, he's just pretty good at it,
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.080]   he's super excited, and they talk about books,
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:08.200]   and they get excited about different books.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:13.200]   I mean, it also gives me a sense of where the chess world is
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:17.880]   from a different perspective,
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:20.560]   it's like people studying chess,
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:23.660]   like what they get excited about, how difficult it is,
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:26.920]   yeah, it's nice to get a sense of the community,
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.360]   the language that's used,
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.760]   because I did wanna have a bunch of conversations
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.560]   with folks about chess,
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.880]   'cause I think it's a beautiful game
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.680]   and I think it's a beautiful community,
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:39.000]   so that's one of the podcasts I listen to,
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.600]   so yeah, anyway, it's great.
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:42.840]   Anyway, you were saying, why'd you bring him up?
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.400]   - Yes. - Great podcast.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:48.080]   - Great podcast, only reason I thought of it
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.840]   and I use the word small, no disrespect, Ben,
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:54.960]   is because even that episode, which he did with Hans,
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.040]   like it was a small episode,
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:59.400]   it wasn't seen by mass audience of chess.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:01.160]   - He did an episode with Hans recently?
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.840]   - I know, some time ago, yeah,
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:04.640]   and in that episode, Hans very openly is like,
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:07.880]   "Bobby Fischer was misunderstood and he was my idol."
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:08.720]   - Oh, wow. - Said a couple
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:12.040]   of things like that, and Hans is an intense guy,
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:14.680]   like when I listen to Hans, I get a little anxious,
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:17.560]   I just, he brings out some sort of disturbance
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:18.760]   in my ecosystem.
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:21.280]   - Yeah, I can't really pin him down
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:24.160]   to what's going on there,
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:25.840]   as a person who's trying to read people.
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:26.680]   - Yeah.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:31.200]   - It's difficult, like I can, this is the dark aspect,
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.680]   he could be both the genius of Bobby Fischer
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:37.040]   and a genius cheater, and you could see,
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.080]   like there's something chaotic about him
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.320]   which makes him very appealing in that way.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.960]   - Yes, so right now, late September 2022,
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.960]   the current environment is such that Hans
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.360]   hasn't said anything in weeks,
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:58.360]   and people are sort of dissecting every bit
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:03.080]   of circumstantial evidence that they can,
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.680]   and they're trying to present the case,
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:08.400]   I don't even know to who, ultimately,
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:10.720]   I guess it would be the FIDE cheating,
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:12.920]   anti-cheating commission or whatever.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.480]   - It might be to you, essentially.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.320]   - I mean-- - To people
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.960]   on the platform. - It could be.
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:21.500]   - To present convincing evidence to where the people,
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:23.720]   the people are convinced that one way or the other.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:25.120]   Because for people who don't know,
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.080]   and they should definitely follow Gotham Chess,
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.840]   you've been on this, you've covered it a lot,
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:32.360]   and I'm sure if anything comes out, you'll cover it more,
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:34.420]   but you've been quite balanced and thoughtful
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.160]   and kind of objective about the whole thing.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.200]   - Yeah, so the reason for that is,
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.440]   I understand the power that I wield
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:49.440]   with anything, and if I say one sentence the wrong way,
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:54.960]   I might be sending 10,000 people or more to go do something.
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.280]   - Yeah.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.120]   - And I hate that.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.120]   I want to present the evidence,
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:00.680]   and I want the video to end, and people go,
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.680]   okay, I understand, not, I'ma go fuck someone up.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.760]   You know what I mean?
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:11.620]   'Cause that's, and I also believe that even if Hans,
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.320]   even if Hans is guilty, this goes all the way back.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:18.960]   He's a human being.
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:20.000]   - Yeah.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.320]   - And you can argue that cheaters gotta be punished,
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:27.440]   and you can argue that people who do things wrong,
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:29.960]   you shouldn't feel any sort of compassion,
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.520]   but I would hate to have the whole world
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:33.080]   pointing their fingers at me,
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.640]   the entire world that I've known my entire life,
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:40.640]   and even if I messed up, there's still a world after chess.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.760]   There might still even be a world in chess.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.040]   I don't know, but that stuff, it doesn't make me,
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.880]   it doesn't make me feel good to present
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:52.360]   all of the circumstantial evidence in my videos
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:55.560]   and start being like, yeah, it looks, you know, so.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:57.840]   - But at the same time, you deeply care about chess
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.160]   and the chess community, and there's some sense where,
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:04.160]   was it you or was it Magnus that said
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.200]   that cheating poses an existential threat to chess?
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.280]   - Magnus said that.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.200]   - I mean, there is some aspect of truth to that,
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.960]   which is like, you know, the chess is in a state
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:18.800]   where bots, chess engines are much better than humans,
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:21.000]   and we're living in a world where technology
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.640]   becomes easier and easier to integrate with human beings,
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:27.500]   whether you put it in some office or elsewhere,
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.500]   and that does pose a threat to our ability to trust
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:35.480]   that a world champion is indeed a world champion,
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:38.720]   that somebody we think is good is indeed good,
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.400]   and so there is some aspect to the ecosystem
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.040]   that should punish cheating and perhaps over-punish cheating.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.680]   - And the other thing is, in sport, you can take PEDs
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.040]   and have bigger muscles, bigger, better reaction time,
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:00.040]   but you still have to perform the action
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:01.280]   in a successful way.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:05.620]   There is still a chance you can lose if you take PEDs.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:08.600]   Maybe in some sports, the gap between non-PED
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.440]   and PED user is significantly more noticeable,
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:16.440]   but in chess, if you cheat, you play God.
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:19.880]   - Yeah.
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:21.840]   - You decide when the game is over.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:24.440]   You can fake bad moves.
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.640]   You can fake everything.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.520]   You can even, if you're cheating, quote-unquote,
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:31.160]   the right way, you're gonna lose plenty of games
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.960]   to avoid getting detected.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.920]   - So you can create bots that are 2,800, like--
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:38.560]   - You can also just not listen.
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:39.840]   If you know all the best moves,
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:40.960]   but choose to play on your own,
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:42.600]   and, oh, I made a mistake, not a big deal.
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:45.840]   You could, yes, bots are all at a different level,
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:50.840]   but if you were to cheat, that, you play God.
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:53.880]   You can decide when you make your move
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:55.200]   and when the engine makes its move,
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.200]   and if you know the top four lines of the engine,
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:58.320]   you choose the fourth one.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:01.040]   So in hindsight, people will analyze your game
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.680]   and they will go, oh, it wasn't perfect.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:04.520]   Well, no shit.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.520]   Only the stupid cheaters play the top engine line
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.360]   the whole game.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:08.800]   - By the way, I'm not saying that this is
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.080]   what's happening here, but-- - Correct.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:16.080]   - But there's probably an excitement to playing God
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:20.480]   to, and getting away with it.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.640]   - I know people, I know adults, grown adults
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:28.600]   who are successful in their fields,
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:31.680]   and they cheat, they cheat in lessons,
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:35.720]   they cheat in, like I've, I don't wanna say I've taught any.
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:37.840]   May or may not have.
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:39.280]   For some reason, one of them watches this
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:40.960]   and they know they're guilty.
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.680]   And it happens, it happens.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:44.840]   Not just teenagers, not just young adults,
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:47.600]   but full-grown adults will cheat when they play
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:49.860]   because they think it helps them learn.
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.600]   - Oh, well, that's good, that could be just justification.
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:56.560]   But I just meant like, it might not be just about winning.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:00.000]   It might also just feel good to have that power.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.200]   - Power?
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:03.200]   - Like, I bet you it's a drug.
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:04.360]   - Oh yeah.
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.280]   I mean, like with a lot of criminals,
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:10.200]   with a lot of criminals, I feel like part of,
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:13.300]   like the mass murderers, serial killers,
[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.840]   I feel like a lot of it is they can get away with it.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:20.080]   The fact that they, like everyone else is a sucker
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:23.260]   and they figured out how to do this evil thing.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:26.280]   And obviously cheating is nowhere close to that,
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:30.320]   but there's still a feeling of getting away with it.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.300]   Yeah, I wonder.
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.640]   I mean, you're pretty objective on the whole thing.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:38.160]   But where, if you were a betting man,
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:40.800]   what would you say is the probability?
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:42.560]   Are you changing day by day in your head?
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.600]   What's the probability that Hans cheated?
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:50.320]   Over the board against Magnus in St. Louis.
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:51.960]   - That's a tough one, man.
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:57.000]   - Have you even allowed yourself to put a probability on it?
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.960]   - No, not on that specific game,
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:03.120]   because I think a lot of that game was affected
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.160]   by Magnus' own psyche.
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:07.320]   That was one of his worst games ever.
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.280]   - So he played poorly too, Magnus played poorly.
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:11.160]   - Which doesn't help his case.
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:14.580]   Hans might've cheated in that game, but we'll never know.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:19.760]   I think day by day,
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:25.020]   the evidence is slowly starting to show more and more
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:29.560]   that he's cheated, like how Magnus said,
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.460]   more than he said and more recently.
[02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:36.160]   It's undeniable, a lot of the statistics are there.
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:40.920]   The problem is you can't prove you're not cheating.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:46.680]   Unless you strip naked, like that site
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.360]   offered him a million bucks too.
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:51.000]   Everything about the--
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.960]   - Wait, which site offered him a million bucks?
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.800]   - I saw some headline that said
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:55.280]   Hans Niemann has offered a million bucks.
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:56.680]   - It can't be real.
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:59.200]   - And where I struggle to comprehend
[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:01.280]   is how on earth he could pull it off
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:07.200]   and I'm a guilty, my brain goes to guilt first
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:11.760]   and resentment, remorse, guilt, that trio.
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:15.280]   - Magnus put out a statement as we speak yesterday
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:18.920]   saying, "Dear Chess World, at the 2022 Sinkfield Cup,
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:20.880]   "I made the unprecedented professional decision
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:22.160]   "to withdraw from the tournament
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:25.200]   "after my round three game against Hans Niemann.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.720]   "A week later, during the Champions Chess Tour,
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:30.840]   "I resigned against Hans Niemann
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:32.580]   "after playing only one move.
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:34.880]   "I know that my actions have frustrated
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:36.520]   "many in the chess community.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:37.620]   "I'm frustrated.
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:38.740]   "I want to play chess.
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.040]   "I want to continue to play chess
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:42.220]   "at the highest level and the best events.
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:45.600]   "I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.220]   "and an existential threat to the game.
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:50.640]   "I also believe that chess organizers
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:53.560]   "and all those who care about the sanctity of the game
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:55.500]   "we love should seriously consider
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:56.880]   "increasing security measures
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:00.260]   "and methods of cheat detection for over-the-board chess.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:02.940]   "When Niemann was invited last minute
[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:05.020]   "to the 2022 Sinkfield Cup,
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:08.220]   "I strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event
[02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:09.680]   "I ultimately chose to play."
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:10.840]   That's the thing you're referring to,
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:13.260]   is that he can, like now we know
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:15.140]   he was torn about the whole thing.
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:18.980]   "I believe that Niemann has cheated more and more recently
[02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:20.700]   "than he has publicly admitted.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:24.280]   "His over-the-board progress has been unusual
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.000]   "and throughout our game in Sinkfield Cup,
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.940]   "I had the impression that he wasn't tense
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.780]   "or even fully concentrating on the game
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:33.060]   "in critical positions,
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:35.280]   "while outplaying me as black in a way
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.080]   "I think only a handful of players can do.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.720]   "This game contributed to changing my perspective.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:45.240]   "He must do, we must do something about cheating.
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:47.140]   "And for my part, going forward,
[02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:49.400]   "I don't want to play against people
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:51.480]   "that have cheated repeatedly in the past
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.040]   "because I don't know what they're capable
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.380]   "of doing in the future.
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.960]   "There's more than I would like to say, unfortunately.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:01.120]   "At this time, I'm limited in what I can say
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:04.080]   "without explicit permission from Niemann to speak openly.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.660]   "So far, I have only been able to speak with my actions
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:10.860]   "and those actions have stated clearly
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.540]   "that I am not willing to play chess with Niemann.
[02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:16.240]   "I hope that the truth in this matter comes out,
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.360]   "whatever it may be.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.720]   "Sincerely, Magnus Carlsen, world chess champion."
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:25.240]   - How would you sign off your statements?
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:26.180]   - If I was a world--
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:27.600]   - No, just say whatever.
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:29.760]   Lex Fridman, what would be the title?
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.600]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.520]   I think I would not, even if I was a world champion,
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:35.660]   I would just say Lex.
[02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:38.920]   Or make up a title.
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.040]   And I feel like I really fucked up in life
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.880]   if I have to tweet a statement as an image.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:49.240]   That's like when you get, you're a politician
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:51.680]   and you got caught cheating on your wife,
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:54.200]   like for many years in a row.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:55.040]   - Yes.
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.640]   - Then I tweet an image.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:59.360]   I'm sorry for all the people I have hurt
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.480]   and the people that believed in me and whatever else.
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.680]   And then I would sign world chess champion.
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:08.520]   - You know the most, like the modern way to give a statement
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.960]   what I thought Magnus was gonna do.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:10.800]   - Yeah.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:11.920]   - Thought he was gonna write,
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:16.920]   "On the recent scandal,"
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.280]   or my statement on the past few weeks, tweet longer.
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:23.120]   - What do you mean?
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:24.680]   - So you put a URL.
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.520]   - Oh yeah.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.920]   - For tweets, but it's unlimited characters.
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:28.760]   It's not 140.
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:29.580]   - I didn't know what that is.
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:30.420]   Can you explain that to me?
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:32.680]   - Yeah, so generally when a celebrity
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:34.480]   has a giant audience on Twitter,
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:37.600]   they will make their statement on social media
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:40.920]   and say what it is in a sentence, one line,
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:42.200]   and then there's a link.
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:43.400]   - Where does the link take you?
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.560]   - To a website called TwitLonger.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:46.400]   - Oh, that's the national website.
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.640]   - TwitLonger, yeah.
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:49.240]   And that is where they write their statements.
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:50.360]   That is what I was expecting.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.200]   - Who did this?
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.520]   I haven't seen this before.
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:53.680]   - Oh, this is awesome.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:55.000]   I don't have one off the top of my head,
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.240]   but it's just that Kanye, Kim Kardashian breaking up,
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.080]   they would use that?
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:00.360]   - Streamers, musicians, yeah.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:01.760]   I don't think politicians use it
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.480]   'cause it's just feel like--
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:05.000]   - Yeah, they use the image.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.280]   - Yeah, MySpace and Facebook, right?
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:13.380]   I would probably go, I like,
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:16.400]   I mean, I'm not just being biased here
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:17.960]   just 'cause I have a podcast.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.560]   I'm a huge fan of podcasts.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:22.480]   I feel like I would go on a podcast to talk about it
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.600]   with somebody I trust, so like long form
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:25.440]   and discuss it.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.040]   - Thought he was gonna do that too.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.680]   In fact, I wanted to write him a message
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.360]   and be like, I can be that guy for you.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:37.680]   I have a very strange relationship with Magnus because--
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:38.800]   - Good, bad?
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.620]   - I don't, we've never interacted.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:44.900]   I very openly,
[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:48.880]   I don't wanna say use him for views
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:51.320]   because that is a very crude way of saying it.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:53.440]   But if you wanted to insult my YouTube channel,
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:55.360]   that is what you would say.
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.720]   So-- - Oh, Magnus is in a lot
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:59.440]   of videos? - Thumbnails or videos.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:02.440]   Not clickbaity, but if he's playing in a tournament
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:03.920]   and he plays a great game,
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:06.320]   he's going on that fucking thumbnail.
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.320]   Because-- - Oh, because,
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:10.560]   let's see, he's the number one chess player,
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.960]   very likely the greatest chess player of all time.
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:14.320]   Plus he's exciting.
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:17.240]   - And YouTube algorithm loves his name
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:18.600]   and people click on it.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:20.680]   - Oh, do they? - His videos do the best.
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.200]   - Yeah, but I don't know what the chicken
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.760]   or the egg is, but the reason it loves it,
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.280]   the reason people click on it is because
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.760]   he is an exciting personality,
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.800]   he's an exciting chess player.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:34.320]   There's something compelling about him.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:36.000]   - Yeah. - He's also,
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.320]   he knows how to, in a subtle, dry,
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.640]   wit, humor way, talk shit.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.000]   With the silences and all of that.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.400]   - Yes. - He knows it,
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.360]   he knows it, he knows the whole game of it.
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:49.640]   - Specifically to Magnus, my relationship with him,
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:51.640]   we've never interacted and throughout
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:53.880]   the last couple of years,
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.880]   he generally has interacted with Hikaru as a competitor.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:01.040]   He has done some collabs with the Bottezes,
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.880]   he obviously has talked to Ludwig,
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:05.960]   who's a very, very big streamer.
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:09.440]   And part of me regrets the fact that
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.960]   when I was smaller as a YouTuber and a Twitch streamer,
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:19.960]   I'm sure I used to make jokes or some tweets at Magnus,
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.640]   like when Magnus would tweet something,
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.840]   I would try to respond so I could be the top reply,
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.880]   'cause that was my social media.
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:26.800]   I literally think, I once responded to a Magnus tweet
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.560]   and saying, "Responding for engagement."
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:31.360]   'Cause it was some, it wasn't some controversial tweet,
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.040]   it was just something funny.
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.360]   And I went, "Ha ha, responding for engagement."
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.040]   Because I was just being a little bit of an idiot
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:40.880]   and I knew that if it got enough likes,
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:43.160]   it would be at the top and people would see me, my brand,
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.040]   and just get to know me, this is the type of--
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:46.640]   - Please don't use the word brand, but yes.
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.160]   - Yes. (laughs)
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.360]   But yeah, no, and your worry is that
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:52.600]   he wouldn't take you seriously.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:53.440]   - He wouldn't take me seriously,
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.120]   and if I was one of the best of all time
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:00.760]   and I saw some dude on YouTube just kind of being a moron
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.000]   and I'm all over his thumbnails,
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.200]   I can imagine he has a very legitimate case.
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.520]   - I appreciate your humility and self-critical nature,
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:11.520]   but one of the realities with people like him
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:18.200]   is he wouldn't hold a grudge or not treat you seriously.
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.200]   I'm pretty sure he's a fan, he's a big supporter.
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:26.880]   He doesn't watch YouTube videos of that kind.
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:28.040]   - I barely watch YouTube videos.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.520]   - I think of chess.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:33.680]   He might watch more fun chess adjacent stuff,
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:36.280]   but it's not for him.
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:39.560]   So I'm pretty sure he knows of you and likes you
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:44.200]   and your commenting on stuff has zero effect on his belief,
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.320]   which is funny that's something you think about.
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:49.360]   Now you're perfect, but you're well-respected.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:52.960]   A lot of people mention you as a person who's like,
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:55.720]   "Okay, this person's legit," which is an important thing.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:57.560]   It's not just an entertainer.
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:00.320]   It's not just a shit talker and so on.
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:02.520]   This person is a great educator,
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:05.800]   great fan and student of chess,
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:08.560]   a great player himself, so all of those components.
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:10.600]   So yeah, you're definitely a good person.
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:13.800]   And on this particular aspect, have been very objective.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:17.440]   I understand that I'm nowhere near perfect.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:19.920]   I'm not a different person on camera, off camera.
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.000]   I will say it like it is, maybe on Twitch.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.040]   You gotta dig in the mud there a little bit more,
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:28.440]   a lot more sarcastic, a lot more brash and whatnot,
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:32.280]   but you meet me in a taco place
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:34.680]   and I'll talk with you the same way I might
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:38.960]   if it was a video, just that you may not consider me
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:40.360]   just a random guy at a taco place.
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:41.920]   And that's why I think about this stuff
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:43.600]   with specific to Magnus.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.280]   And it's one of the reasons I don't reach out
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:47.920]   to him directly ever.
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:49.680]   I never have, I've never DM'd him on Instagram
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.400]   hoping for a response, never.
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:53.920]   I've never even reached out to anyone on his team
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:57.320]   trying to get a conversation very candid with him,
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:59.040]   which I think it would be.
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:02.480]   I even barely reached out to guys in the top 10,
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:05.160]   like top 15, only recently started pushing myself more
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:06.560]   to do that.
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.440]   And I, even in my intro messages to them,
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.440]   preemptively say something like,
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:14.280]   "You might think I'm some idiot,
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:16.360]   you might not be totally wrong."
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:17.200]   - Yes.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:19.760]   - But like, I think this would be a good conversation
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:20.600]   and give it a shot.
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:23.080]   And I've been surprised, I've been ignored by a few,
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:25.160]   but some said, "Oh yeah, I've seen your stuff."
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.000]   Generally a fan, like no problem.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.800]   I was actually really blown away.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:31.560]   This YouTube channel, Levidov Chess,
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.360]   it's a Russian chess channel.
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:36.040]   And I think the last name of the guy is,
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.000]   the name of the channel is named after Ilya Levidov
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.280]   who has some sort of managerial role
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:41.920]   in the Russian Chess Federation.
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:44.600]   And this channel has interviewed
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:46.880]   some of the greatest players of all time.
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.960]   They have interviews with the modern best Russian players
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:52.040]   and Kasparov, Karpov, Kramnik,
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:54.840]   you name these guys from Russian chess.
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.480]   History, it's unbelievable.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:57.720]   I just thought this was a channel
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:02.120]   of just unbelievably well-respected chess players
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:05.840]   and legion of fans that were longtime chess fans.
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:10.080]   And I mentioned them very briefly in a YouTube video.
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:15.080]   And that little clip went into their next community event.
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:18.560]   And the founder of the channel went on this two minute,
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:22.360]   beautiful description of why he liked me
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:24.560]   and how he only watched my channel as a beginner
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:26.720]   and how I have a natural voice
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:28.120]   and how if I talked about cards,
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:30.320]   I would have a million, a hundred million subscribers,
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:34.000]   just all this really kind stuff that in my mind,
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.080]   I thought was either undeserved or I just never fathomed that.
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:41.840]   - Yeah, I mean, you certainly should not feel as deserved.
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:44.360]   You should have humility about that kind of stuff.
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:47.200]   But I think that is the thing that works over time.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.720]   It's like reputation spreads,
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:51.760]   which is like if one person likes you
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:53.400]   and they tell you to other people
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.080]   and it kind of spreads and over time,
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:58.260]   you have one conversation with a top 10,
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:01.280]   like a super grandmaster,
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.880]   and they say nice things about you.
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:04.200]   And it just kind of spreads.
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:07.340]   'Cause I've been very surprised in all walks of life.
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:15.520]   This really gets me, this makes me happy, honestly.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:19.800]   'Cause people ask me how I get guests and so on.
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.120]   And it just seems honestly, just be a good person
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:27.440]   and like a real person and honest.
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:30.080]   And it just kind of spreads the word of mouth.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.400]   - You know, even coming here, I almost didn't reach out.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:36.240]   - What do you mean?
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.120]   - I had seen you at Denver talk to a chess person
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.800]   and I've watched a lot of,
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:42.200]   I've watched some of the things start to finish,
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:43.920]   especially if the guest I'm really interested in,
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:46.440]   like George St. Pierre, I'll watch that guy do whatever.
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:47.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:48.560]   I'll watch him do basically anything.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.840]   - Yeah. - Make an omelet or something.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.440]   - Yeah, I love listening to him.
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:54.080]   Some of the other things I've listened to as well.
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.200]   And I noticed that neither, well, to me,
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:02.040]   you obviously and Joe are the two biggest podcasters.
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:03.240]   I don't know if that's like factual.
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:05.280]   I don't know if some influencer has some podcasts,
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:08.000]   but you guys interview folks that I listen to
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.240]   more often than anybody else.
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:15.440]   And when Magnus came on, I was like, oh, that's amazing.
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.560]   I don't even know how I would reach out
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:18.400]   to someone like you.
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:21.840]   It just seems like a limb, like climbing a mountain.
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:23.120]   And then a couple of days later,
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:25.560]   and I even in that episode wanted to write,
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:26.400]   but I didn't know how.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:28.040]   I was like, do I make a YouTube comment?
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:28.880]   I don't want that.
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:30.840]   I'm a little like I'm clout chasing on the Magnus episode.
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.640]   But then you talked about Tezos and I said,
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:35.480]   oh, I shouldn't overthink it.
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:36.320]   - Yeah.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.040]   - Like, you know, so I just said, all right, fuck it.
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.480]   I'll just write a comment.
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:41.680]   And you're like, yeah, I'd love to have you on.
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:42.680]   I was shocked.
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:45.840]   I didn't even, you responded just within a couple hours
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:46.680]   or something.
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:47.880]   - Yeah, yeah, I loved it, man.
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:49.200]   I mean, it was an honor.
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:50.360]   It's a good way to connect.
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:53.520]   I also like on live streams, I'll watch,
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:56.960]   I try to resist commenting, but you know,
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:00.160]   I'll watch some even smaller channels.
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.240]   Like I'll get super excited by them
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:03.560]   and connect in that way.
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.080]   There's an intimacy to that.
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.360]   Man, YouTube is beautiful.
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.360]   I don't know anything about Twitch.
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:09.200]   Maybe it's similar.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:10.640]   - You don't need to know anything about it.
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.000]   - But YouTube has--
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.480]   - Ruin you.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:16.640]   - There is an intimacy, like, especially if it's live.
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:19.360]   I don't know what that is, but if it's live,
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:21.400]   they're like right there.
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:24.160]   You can just like reach out and say hello.
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:25.000]   - Yeah, it's cool.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.600]   It's like really, I don't know.
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:29.720]   I'm just happy to live in this time
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:31.480]   when you can connect with people in that way.
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:32.400]   There is an intimacy.
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:34.320]   That's why I love podcasts too.
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:38.160]   I listen to people and I feel like they're my friend.
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:39.000]   It's cool.
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.680]   It's a cool feeling.
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:44.280]   It makes you feel less lonely in this world.
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:46.080]   Like you have a lifelong companion,
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:47.640]   especially like people that do a podcast
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:49.120]   for many, many years.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.200]   I'm like, you've gone through all the ups and downs
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:53.400]   of life together.
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:57.480]   With a creator, with a podcast, or with anything, it's cool.
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:00.000]   I don't know, it makes it,
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.440]   it's surprisingly intimate, a one-way friendship.
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:03.880]   (laughs)
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:05.280]   Maybe for an intro, I don't know.
[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:10.280]   - There's some negatives that people definitely describe.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:13.920]   The word that gets used a lot is parasocial.
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:16.120]   You think you, like the viewer will think
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:20.040]   that the streamer or the YouTuber knows them
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:22.240]   or owes them something or has some,
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:25.120]   they have a bigger connection than they do.
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:27.320]   - Yeah, you know what, actually, sorry to interrupt.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.960]   I have to look, maybe you can explain to me.
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:31.000]   I've heard this term parasocial a lot.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.440]   I'm meaning to look it up.
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.720]   Might as well look it up while in live.
[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:35.560]   (laughs)
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:36.400]   - Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:39.400]   - Parasocial interaction, PSI, refers,
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:40.520]   is this a new term?
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:41.920]   'Cause I have just started listening,
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.960]   hearing it like the last year or so.
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:45.960]   - Yeah.
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:48.200]   - Parasocial interaction, PSI, refers to a kind
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.120]   of psychological relationship experienced
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:53.400]   by an audience in their mediated encounters
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.160]   with performance in the mass media,
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:58.700]   particularly on television and on online platforms.
[02:22:58.700 --> 02:23:01.800]   Viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities
[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:04.700]   as friends despite having no or limited interaction
[02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:06.920]   with, oh shit, that's a term for a thing
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:11.220]   I've been referring to, interesting.
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:13.320]   The term was coined by Donald Horton
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:15.920]   and Richard Wall in 1956.
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:16.760]   - Wow.
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:19.340]   - When there was like a very limited media, huh?
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.520]   - Wow.
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:23.200]   - I guess TV and radio and stuff, yeah, yeah.
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:25.400]   Parasocial interaction and exposure
[02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:27.400]   that gamers' interest in a persona
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:29.000]   become a parasocial relationship
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.840]   after repeated exposure to the media.
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:32.920]   Yeah, okay, what's the downside, bro?
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:34.080]   What's, okay.
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:35.480]   - Oh, well, I can tell you the downside.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:37.560]   The downside is people thinking they're
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:40.640]   in relationships with streamers and stalking them.
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:41.480]   That's--
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:44.160]   - Oh, the stalking part, but the relationship is like,
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:48.000]   I mean, okay, you mean like actual relationship,
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.140]   like waking up and saying, how are you doing?
[02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:54.340]   Like in your head to them, yeah, no.
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:57.820]   But that might be an extension, more like,
[02:23:57.820 --> 02:24:01.140]   yeah, getting mad they don't respond to you
[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:04.700]   in anytime you're in the stream
[02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:09.020]   or that convincing yourself the other person wants you
[02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:11.860]   and you need to go to them,
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:14.140]   so you need to find where they are.
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:15.620]   Like this has happened.
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:18.180]   Some of the biggest female streamers have reported
[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:21.840]   that they get stalked and harassed for months
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:23.820]   and that's born out of this.
[02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:28.640]   This on a very small scale is you come into a stream
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.180]   every so often and give an update about your academic career.
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:33.060]   That's not so bad.
[02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:36.340]   I was gonna mention, I've streamed on Twitch for years
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:38.960]   and I watched people have kids.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:41.180]   Like people will come in over the course of months
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:43.100]   and say, hey man, I just finished,
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:44.540]   I just took the bar exam.
[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:46.740]   Yo man, like I'm having my first kid.
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:49.160]   And that's crazy, that's amazing.
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.240]   But if they do it in a healthy way, that's one thing.
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.620]   - But there's always gonna be downsides,
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:58.180]   but most of it is beautiful, man.
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:03.180]   I have very, I have, I guess,
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:06.900]   parasocial relationships of people
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:10.300]   that take it a little too far, but it's all love.
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:12.220]   - You also have a fundamental belief
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:14.660]   and hope in people to be good.
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:15.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:19.280]   And I haven't gotten in trouble with it yet.
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.540]   - That's a good thing.
[02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:23.980]   Me too, I've interacted with plenty of people in person
[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.980]   and no one's been negative.
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:28.060]   - And I've even gone to a war zone.
[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:30.100]   - I can't.
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:32.180]   - There's no, there hasn't been,
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:35.660]   people have been very, I don't know.
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:40.460]   People have only surprised me in the positive direction,
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:43.980]   in the depth of the capacity they have for compassion.
[02:25:43.980 --> 02:25:48.420]   Do we, okay, so now we're in this weird place
[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:49.420]   with the cheating.
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:54.420]   Can I ask you a question about how it's possible to cheat?
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:58.300]   If you and I, the conversation you're gonna have
[02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:00.340]   with Magnus, we're gonna play chess.
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:02.840]   If we're trying to figure out how can you beat him,
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:05.940]   what are the different ways, do you think?
[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:08.060]   Over the board chess, what are the ways to cheat?
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:09.180]   - Cheating? - Yeah.
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:13.300]   - That's where I lose the thread because I don't know.
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:16.020]   - That's what I immediately went to,
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:18.380]   is the engineering challenge of cheating.
[02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:20.740]   - Right, well, that's because that's,
[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:21.740]   that's 'cause you're good at that.
[02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:24.140]   I mean, you're not good at creating cheating
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:25.140]   in over the board situations.
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:27.060]   I'm just saying your brain works differently.
[02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:30.240]   I just choose to not even, I can't entertain that.
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:31.780]   I can come up with some bullshit,
[02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:33.180]   but it's not gonna be anywhere near--
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:36.100]   - Oh, your mind is not immediately attracted
[02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:38.700]   to pulling at that thread of how would you fuck
[02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:39.580]   with the system?
[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.260]   - Yeah, my mind stops at,
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:43.780]   ha, that would have to be a really sophisticated thing,
[02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:46.140]   and that's it, it doesn't go any further.
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:48.260]   My brain every day thinks about the best way
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:51.300]   to compartmentalize chess into a digestible format
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:53.740]   and put it out into content.
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.260]   - Chess on the board, chess not cheating.
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:00.500]   - Yeah, I just think about YouTube,
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:01.380]   I just think about that.
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:03.340]   That's currently where my mind is fully focused.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.860]   I'm also working on a book, so.
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:06.700]   - So that's what you're thinking.
[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:07.900]   - Yes. - Yeah, for me,
[02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:09.700]   'cause I've built chess engines
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:12.620]   without understanding chess much.
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:16.900]   As anyone does who's interested in AI,
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:18.340]   you build all kinds of systems
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:19.420]   that do all kinds of stuff,
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:21.860]   and chess is just an easy game.
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:25.660]   It starts with Othello, goes up to chess, and go.
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:28.460]   It's just a great benchmark, a great place
[02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:30.440]   to explore different AI algorithms,
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:34.260]   from search to machine learning and so on.
[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:36.020]   But to me, cheating is like,
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:38.620]   it's a similar kind of ideas.
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:41.940]   Well, if I make it a board instead of eight by eight
[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:45.100]   to 10 by 10, how does it change things?
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.340]   And with cheating, it's almost like expanding
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:50.900]   the engineering challenge of chess out into the real world.
[02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:53.140]   To me, okay, so just allow me,
[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:55.240]   I know cheating is horrible and everything,
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:01.700]   but Stockfish, AI engine, and human working together
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:05.100]   in interesting ways, forget chess.
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:07.900]   Just machine and human working together
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:11.300]   to expand the capability of the human is really fascinating.
[02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:13.620]   And that's a beautiful thing to me.
[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:18.220]   Of course, purely for the chess game, it ruins the game.
[02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:23.220]   But I just like thinking of how AI can interact
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:28.820]   with the human in ways that it's frictionless,
[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:34.060]   like neural link brain computer interfaces dream
[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:38.420]   of directly connecting the human brain to AI system.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:41.020]   - The problem in this case is I don't think the human
[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:43.840]   and the AI are interacting together.
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:45.060]   The AI dominates.
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:47.940]   The human is just the mechanism that makes the moves.
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:50.820]   - I actually played, if I may,
[02:28:50.820 --> 02:28:52.180]   maybe I need your advice on this.
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:55.020]   I thought, and I told myself I won't do it,
[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:56.520]   and then a friend of mine said,
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:02.860]   a couple of friends, and both of them are previous guests
[02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:05.740]   in this podcast, told me I definitely need to do it,
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:10.060]   which is connect.
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:13.160]   So I already have, for the chess arm that I built,
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:16.100]   this computer vision on the chess board is able
[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:21.100]   to extract from vision the way you do optical character
[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:24.340]   recognition to extract the board.
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:27.780]   So I was gonna just build that cheating system
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:29.660]   to demonstrate it with,
[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:32.020]   the reason I thought it was interesting,
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:35.220]   so something we didn't mention is,
[02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:36.460]   I don't know who started this rumor,
[02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:39.540]   but the rumor started that it might've been like anal beads
[02:29:39.540 --> 02:29:41.900]   that, I don't know who started this,
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:44.500]   but I do know that Elon magnified it.
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:46.400]   - My username was dead center in that thing
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:48.700]   that he retweeted, which was hilarious to me.
[02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:51.300]   - You're using, what do you mean?
[02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:52.420]   Oh, for tweet.
[02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:56.100]   - He retweeted the clip, but also the copy pasta,
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:30:01.060]   like the paragraph that was like describing
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:04.220]   the whole anal beads theory and dead center
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:08.100]   in the middle of that paragraph is as Gotham chess says.
[02:30:08.100 --> 02:30:12.260]   And the worst part about it was I was literally tagged.
[02:30:12.260 --> 02:30:16.300]   So it was as user slash Gotham chess says.
[02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:19.460]   So every time that paragraph gets posted on Reddit,
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:20.300]   I get tagged.
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:23.180]   Getting posted a lot.
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.820]   So yes, but yes, he tweeted.
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:26.620]   - And then there's also the funny thing,
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:31.220]   which I really love, the weirdest, most entertaining thing.
[02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:36.220]   Was that part of the same thing where like a plot twist,
[02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:39.580]   Magnus has been using anal beads this whole time.
[02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:40.500]   That's how he got.
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:42.100]   - Yes, yes.
[02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:43.860]   - Oh, I love that so much.
[02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:46.300]   Okay, but anyway, there's a,
[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:53.020]   I quickly realized that there is,
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:57.220]   I have to admit that I know not much about sex toys.
[02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:01.220]   And then I quickly realized that there's a lot of sex toys
[02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:04.060]   that have Bluetooth capability that you can interact with.
[02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:08.500]   So it's very easy to connect stock fish to sex toys.
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:10.980]   - Actually, wow.
[02:31:10.980 --> 02:31:11.820]   - Actually, yes.
[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.940]   So apparently that's a popular thing.
[02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:18.940]   Like a lot of sex toys are Bluetooth enabled
[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:20.260]   so you can communicate with them.
[02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:22.700]   So this is actually pretty trivial to do.
[02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:25.980]   Not trivial, but then, and then in fact,
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:28.860]   there's several libraries.
[02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:31.380]   One of them is really active called,
[02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:33.780]   now this is on GitHub, friends.
[02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:35.900]   It's in Rust, but I think there's Python wrappers.
[02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:39.060]   It's called Buttplug is the name of the library.
[02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:41.420]   That communicates with,
[02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:43.980]   it supports a bunch of different devices,
[02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:46.460]   a bunch of different like vibrators
[02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:47.660]   and all that kind of stuff.
[02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:49.900]   But then I looked at the kind of vibrators it supports
[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:51.220]   and they're all like creepy looking.
[02:31:51.220 --> 02:31:56.220]   I mean, like it doesn't have,
[02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:00.100]   I don't know, it felt too dirty.
[02:32:00.100 --> 02:32:01.300]   Like there's a line, I was like,
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:02.820]   ah, is this not gonna,
[02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:04.620]   'cause the reason I like that kind of stuff
[02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:06.220]   is I like the joke of it
[02:32:06.220 --> 02:32:09.420]   that ultimately is somehow educational.
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.940]   'Cause to me, I really care about AI
[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:12.700]   and this is a cool little project to do.
[02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:14.060]   It's super easy to share.
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:17.300]   Yeah, but I was thinking about doing it.
[02:32:17.300 --> 02:32:18.460]   I was thinking about doing it.
[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:21.540]   At first I said, no, it's just kind of feels dirty.
[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:24.820]   But then the aforementioned friend said,
[02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:26.420]   no, you should definitely do it.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:28.140]   I like the--
[02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:30.380]   - Who's your test subject?
[02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.220]   - No, we wouldn't test,
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:32.860]   you should just, well,
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:35.740]   I'm sure that people would sign up, right?
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:38.460]   I just went on the table, like show the vibration,
[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:41.780]   like you're basically converting.
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:45.700]   Now it's not, I'm not obviously a grandmaster.
[02:32:45.700 --> 02:32:48.020]   So you have to say everything.
[02:32:48.020 --> 02:32:48.860]   I feel like--
[02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:50.260]   - No, you don't.
[02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:51.500]   You could say the square.
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:52.900]   You don't have to say the piece.
[02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:54.340]   The human will fill in the gap.
[02:32:54.340 --> 02:32:57.220]   - No, a good human chess player, I can't.
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:32:58.740]   - Oh, okay.
[02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:00.780]   - That's the point I wanted to make is like,
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:03.460]   for me, I would like to know
[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:05.700]   the actual move I need to make.
[02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:07.740]   So I need the full information.
[02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:11.660]   So I have to convert the Bishop C5, whatever,
[02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:14.700]   to Morse code, which is a lot of vibration.
[02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:17.060]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:33:18.060 --> 02:33:19.060]   - But it still works.
[02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:20.060]   It's hilarious and fun.
[02:33:20.060 --> 02:33:21.500]   So I was thinking about doing it,
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:25.300]   but because it's pretty easy to do.
[02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:28.340]   It would be just like a fun exercise.
[02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:32.500]   I love a mix of technical rigor and humor.
[02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:35.180]   - Well, this is the perfect project for that.
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:36.020]   - Right, exactly.
[02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:36.940]   - This was born, I think,
[02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:41.300]   out of a user comment in a Twitch stream.
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:43.340]   So I thought it was born on Reddit, this theory,
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:46.820]   but I think Eric Hansen was streaming.
[02:33:46.820 --> 02:33:50.620]   Chaz Bra, and someone in his chat made that joke,
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:51.900]   and he read it out loud.
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:54.220]   That was the first time it was read out loud.
[02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:55.460]   And then somebody clipped it,
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:59.700]   and it became international news.
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:03.820]   Have you followed how big the traction got
[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:05.140]   on this anal beads thing?
[02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:05.980]   - No.
[02:34:05.980 --> 02:34:08.500]   - It was covered by every major news network,
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:11.300]   late night talk show, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert.
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:12.140]   - No.
[02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:14.180]   - International news, international news
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:15.580]   in countries like China,
[02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:16.740]   where I would have never thought
[02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:19.000]   that they would report about anal beads.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:19.840]   Yeah.
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:22.660]   - Did they, what was the tonality of it?
[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:24.140]   Was it seen as a joke?
[02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:26.980]   Or did they say there's a cheating scandal?
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:27.820]   - I think to a--
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:29.460]   - How do people mention anal beads?
[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:30.940]   - Literally anal beads.
[02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:31.780]   Like just--
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.660]   - Just saying, accused?
[02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:38.860]   - Accused denies cheating with anal beads,
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:39.940]   which he never did.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:41.860]   He never denied cheating with anal beads.
[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:43.780]   It was a joke internet theory.
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.680]   - If I was him, I would lean into it.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:48.180]   - Yeah, I can't imagine, man.
[02:34:48.180 --> 02:34:50.360]   Like that's, I don't know what the right thing
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:52.020]   for him to do is, but it's--
[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:53.540]   - Are you not touching this one?
[02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:54.380]   The anal beads?
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:55.380]   - I've talked about it.
[02:34:55.380 --> 02:34:57.700]   I don't say the words anal beads in my YouTube videos,
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:34:58.540]   but I'll say beads.
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:34:59.380]   - Yeah, you don't say anal beads.
[02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:00.820]   - Yeah, I'll, the thing is--
[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:02.620]   - Do you think I should do the code thing?
[02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.680]   It's like a tutorial.
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:07.420]   - Sure, yeah, I think it would be hilarious.
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:09.180]   If you find a way to do it.
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:10.020]   - Yeah.
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:11.900]   - Yeah, you can show that it is possible
[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:16.860]   to theoretically vibrate via Bluetooth chess moves,
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:20.940]   and if someone shoves it up their ass,
[02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:22.060]   it was another joke.
[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:23.820]   Okay, they offered you to play naked.
[02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:25.540]   They're gonna make you spread your cheeks?
[02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:29.020]   - Yeah, I didn't understand why naked solved the problem.
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:31.060]   I think there's, it doesn't have to be naked.
[02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:32.300]   I don't think naked is enough.
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:33.140]   - Yeah.
[02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:37.020]   - Okay, some questions from Reddit.
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:42.140]   Ask him, ask Levi if he deep down hates his audience.
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:44.220]   - I saw that, yeah, I saw that was the one.
[02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:47.980]   I have a love-hate relationship with the chess subreddit.
[02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:48.820]   - Yeah.
[02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:49.660]   - So that's why some of those questions
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:51.100]   were gonna be tough.
[02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:52.420]   I have a love-hate relationship--
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:53.420]   - Do you think that's a tough question,
[02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:55.180]   or does that come from a place of love?
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:58.340]   - Ah, very tough to say, very tough to say.
[02:35:58.340 --> 02:35:59.660]   - 'Cause love and hate, like,
[02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:01.820]   they're basically next door neighbors on Reddit,
[02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:02.660]   I feel like.
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:03.480]   - Correct.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:05.180]   - They oscillate very quickly between each other.
[02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:07.460]   - Yes, so Reddit chess specifically,
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:10.540]   I think, is mostly folks who are around
[02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:11.640]   before the chess boom.
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:13.420]   So the chess--
[02:36:13.420 --> 02:36:15.100]   - Chess is the chess subreddit, sorry to interrupt.
[02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:15.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:18.100]   So a lot of them have been around for five years,
[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:20.780]   seven years, 10 years, even more.
[02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:22.940]   And I think the average age on Reddit
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:26.100]   is lower than the average age on the chess subreddit.
[02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:29.660]   I think the chess subreddit is beyond the age of 20,
[02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:30.700]   maybe even 25.
[02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:31.540]   Like a lot of folks there are--
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:34.020]   - Oh, ancient, ancient people, in their mid-20s.
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:36.340]   - Yeah, I mean, not 15 or 16.
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:37.580]   Anarchy chess is younger.
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:40.380]   So anarchy chess is basically chess memes.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:41.220]   - That's a subreddit name?
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:42.460]   - Yes, you got it, yeah, anarchy chess.
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:43.300]   It's great.
[02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:44.860]   A lot of stupid memes on there.
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:46.900]   - Do they like you or no, or is it love and hate?
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.780]   - They did until my crypto sponsorship.
[02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:51.580]   (laughs)
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:55.320]   Which is a separate convo that I'm more than happy to have.
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:00.320]   But yeah, so my relationship with the Reddit chess subreddit
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:03.580]   is tough because my content on YouTube
[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:07.540]   stops at a certain point with them.
[02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:09.620]   They can't learn from me
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:12.580]   because I'm tailoring to 95% of my audience,
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:15.020]   which is about 1,600, 1,700 and below.
[02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:19.900]   And I have a lot of content where I jokingly
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:21.580]   make fun of low-rated players.
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:24.160]   And everyone's in on it, and we all have fun.
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:26.180]   And I laugh at myself a ton.
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:28.660]   Laugh at, as you can even see in this conversation.
[02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:31.860]   But just like you mentioned with clips
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:33.820]   and out of context things,
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:36.940]   folks have already formed the perception of my personality.
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:39.100]   There's nothing I can do to win them back.
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:40.780]   And I think the dominant percentage
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:43.540]   of the loudest group of folks on the chess subreddit,
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:45.580]   they just, they have a certain perception of me.
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:47.300]   It's not going to change.
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:49.640]   And you add something like cryptocurrency sponsorship,
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:52.720]   which people on Reddit just in general
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.380]   are relatively negative on the subject,
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:57.600]   is gonna start snowballing more and more.
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:00.540]   So if you ever look up a thread of,
[02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:02.140]   should I buy a Gotham course?
[02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:05.180]   And it's on Reddit chess, it's gonna say no.
[02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:07.620]   Everyone's calling it a scam, overpriced.
[02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:08.460]   - Interesting.
[02:38:08.460 --> 02:38:10.740]   I heard a lot of really positive stuff.
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:13.340]   I don't know where, on Reddit in general.
[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:14.420]   - About me? - Yeah.
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:16.100]   - You might've been looking for it.
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:18.940]   You might've not been looking for negative things.
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:20.380]   And I do-- - No, I was looking
[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:23.980]   for like best educators online, like that kind of stuff.
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:26.240]   - I don't, it might've not been Reddit chess.
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.220]   I'll be totally honest with you.
[02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:29.740]   If you ever go there and look for something
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:33.080]   like best recaps or best educational content
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:35.060]   for intermediates, I'm not mentioned.
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:37.580]   I might not be mentioned because I'm already expected
[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:38.620]   to be on the list.
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:40.580]   So they just kind of want to generally shout out
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:42.700]   smaller creators, totally fine with that.
[02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:44.820]   And I'm not even going on this whole explanation
[02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:46.780]   because I want to win folks back.
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.860]   It's just sort of the reality of the situation.
[02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:50.780]   A lot of my stuff is really clickbaity
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:53.340]   and I'm playing the YouTube game.
[02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:54.220]   - Yeah. - They don't want that.
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:57.940]   - Do you ever feel like a limit or a tension
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:39:02.660]   between your creativity and the YouTube algorithm?
[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:04.980]   Like, do you feel like it has negative effects on you?
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:08.180]   - Yeah, yeah, I want to cover more in-depth stuff
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:11.260]   in a 30 minute video that I think is super useful to people.
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:13.420]   It's only going to get 60,000 views.
[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:15.700]   - And you feel, why is that a bad thing?
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:18.740]   Is it good to mix it up?
[02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:22.260]   - Yes, it's good to mix it up, but I make a video a day.
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:25.420]   I make one bad video, the other videos suffer.
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:30.220]   And then if I make two videos that underperform,
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:32.460]   the rest of the videos don't get pushed out as much.
[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:34.780]   Your earnings can go down 40% day to day,
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:37.740]   which doesn't happen in other careers.
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:40.460]   And if I ever want to supplement,
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:42.820]   if I ever want to make a very instructional video,
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:45.220]   I try to do it in a very fun way.
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:48.340]   So something like eight of Magnus Carlsen's best end games.
[02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:49.900]   You can still learn a ton,
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:52.220]   but the concept of the video is going to be different.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:53.620]   Like I try to still teach things,
[02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:56.260]   but in more interesting and exciting ways.
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:40:01.260]   Like the guy who was scammed for a million dollars,
[02:40:01.260 --> 02:40:04.340]   Alexey Shirov, who was basically promised
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:06.060]   the world championship if he won his match,
[02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:08.860]   he won his match, he didn't get a world championship.
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:10.380]   So there's still stuff in there you can learn.
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:13.540]   And you can, my goal is just you click on the video,
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:16.140]   you learn something and you enjoy yourself, that's it.
[02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:21.140]   - Get people to click on it by any means necessary.
[02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:22.180]   But once they're there,
[02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:23.940]   have quality stuff they can learn.
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:28.980]   - Yeah, man, I wish, so I have zero of those pressures,
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:33.060]   but I also really, really, like I turn off views
[02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:34.020]   and all that kind of stuff.
[02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:35.860]   I don't pay attention to any of that.
[02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:39.140]   But I wish YouTube would like,
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:45.460]   the algorithm would include how good the video is.
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:49.180]   Like beneficial for people's long-term wellbeing
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:52.180]   in the calculation.
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:53.940]   I actually really hate the fact
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:56.380]   that they turned off dislikes.
[02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:57.860]   - Yeah, I didn't get that at all.
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:40:59.740]   - Because like, now I don't know the difference
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:02.100]   between like, for tutorials specifically,
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:05.300]   like I don't know what's a good chess video or not,
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.940]   or what's a good review or not.
[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:10.740]   I mean, it emphasizes following certain people more
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:12.020]   than like if you trust the creator,
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:15.780]   but like, man, I really don't know
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:17.380]   what's a good video or not, essentially.
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:19.340]   And then you have to trust more the title,
[02:41:19.340 --> 02:41:22.820]   and then the click baiting comes in and it's no good.
[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:25.500]   You have to use your own gut instinct as opposed to data.
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:26.340]   Sucks.
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:28.620]   - Yeah, there's videos that have almost no views
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:29.820]   that are still great.
[02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:30.660]   - Incredible.
[02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:31.500]   - Yeah.
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:32.580]   - And some of the best ones,
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:36.460]   some people who are just focused on like the quality
[02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:38.100]   and don't wanna play the game,
[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:39.300]   or don't even know how to play it,
[02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:40.660]   and they don't really wanna play the game
[02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:42.380]   of the YouTube algorithm.
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:43.940]   Yeah, it sucks.
[02:41:43.940 --> 02:41:46.580]   It sucks, especially given how dominant YouTube is
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:51.580]   in defining the sort of the creative energy
[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:55.580]   of our whole civilization of the youth.
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:56.780]   - Not just chess.
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:41:57.780]   - Not just chess.
[02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:02.380]   When are you going to chess box against Eric Rosen?
[02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:04.460]   This is a question from Reddit, chess box.
[02:42:04.460 --> 02:42:07.380]   You said your hands are all messed up.
[02:42:07.380 --> 02:42:09.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:12.100]   - Are you training for something or regular like?
[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:15.380]   - So I also just remembered we never talked about Hikaru,
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:17.300]   so I can talk about Rosen and Hikaru
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:18.940]   in the same chess boxing.
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:19.980]   - Oh shit, all right.
[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:24.380]   Is this your MacGregor like shit talk segment?
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.780]   - No, no, no, no.
[02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:27.660]   Eric Rosen is actually a close friend of mine.
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.820]   I probably have five of those,
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:34.180]   and he just so happens to be not just a chess streamer,
[02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:36.660]   but we talked about buying homes,
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:38.980]   we've talked about, he's stayed at my place.
[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:40.820]   He took my wedding photos.
[02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:43.060]   I flew him to New York and paid for all his stuff
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:45.340]   just so he could hang out with my wife and I
[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:49.380]   and take some 6 a.m. photos in the sun in the park.
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:50.660]   - Oh, he looks familiar.
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:53.860]   - Yeah, so he's a good friend of mine.
[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:56.260]   Now in terms of chess boxing,
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:58.340]   chess boxing is this really fascinating sport
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:01.100]   where you have boxing, but you also have chess,
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:03.020]   and you have rounds.
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:05.260]   So you start a chess game with a clock.
[02:43:05.260 --> 02:43:08.300]   That segment itself lasts for a couple of minutes.
[02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:10.140]   They put the board away and pause the clock,
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:11.540]   whatever the time situation is,
[02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:15.220]   then you box for a minute, and that keeps going on.
[02:43:15.220 --> 02:43:18.060]   I don't know how it works in terms of the time expiring,
[02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:20.660]   meaning in fighting, there's judges
[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:22.740]   that just tell you how the fight was going.
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:25.020]   Here, I don't know who wins and how.
[02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:26.820]   Do you win by, you can win by knockout,
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:27.980]   you can win by checkmate,
[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:29.700]   or their clock can run out on the chess board,
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:31.740]   but is there-- - Who judges?
[02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:33.100]   - Is there a round limit?
[02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:35.600]   Does this just go on and on and on and on?
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:36.440]   You know what I mean?
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:37.860]   - Yeah, I thought it's like 12 rounds, right?
[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:40.580]   Isn't this a thing in Russia?
[02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:41.980]   - It's a big thing in the UK.
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:43.180]   - UK? - Yeah, UK.
[02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:44.520]   I don't know why.
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:48.160]   - And there's a lot of YouTuber events just for boxing.
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:50.920]   So YouTubers just learn to box,
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:52.600]   and then they just box, no chess.
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:55.000]   They just straight up box each other.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.560]   Like Jake Paul, for example.
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.200]   You ever gonna get Jake Paul in here?
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:43:59.360]   - Yeah, I'm sure.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:00.480]   - Okay. - I'm sure.
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:03.440]   - I feel like so many different guests have been mentioned.
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:06.280]   Jake Paul would be a fun guest,
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:07.520]   but he's obviously the biggest scare, right?
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.160]   He's legitimately boxing people.
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.460]   But chess players is never gonna learn to box to that level,
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:16.200]   and all of us are starting basically from zero.
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.080]   And Ludwig talked to me behind the scenes,
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:19.920]   said, "Hey, how would you feel
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:22.240]   "about being in a chess boxing match?"
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:25.520]   I said, "Okay, yeah, maybe.
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:26.360]   "When is it gonna be?"
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:27.920]   He said, "Five months from now."
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:29.880]   I've always wanted to train combat.
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:31.760]   I've weight lifted, I've done cardio,
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:32.600]   I've played basketball. - And you said
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:34.280]   you're a UFC fan too? - Yeah.
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:37.360]   - So you admire fighting? - Yeah, I would enjoy it.
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:40.280]   I just have a really bad lower back,
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:43.500]   and that makes a lot of different combat difficult.
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:45.040]   But I said, "You know what, screw this.
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:47.820]   "I'm going to contact a few local gyms."
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:50.060]   And one of them, the guy emailing me back and forth,
[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:52.260]   had actually watched my YouTube videos.
[02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:54.140]   So he was the first to respond.
[02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:56.340]   And he said, "Yeah, come in, do a couple of classes,
[02:44:56.340 --> 02:44:57.340]   "see how you feel."
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:44:59.540]   So first I did conditioning, which killed me,
[02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:02.540]   because fighting conditioning, as you know, it kills you.
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:04.620]   It's a completely different type of conditioning.
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:07.260]   But I felt good, and I really wanted to come back.
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:10.240]   And since July, I've been training three, four days a week.
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.920]   - Nice, you feel pretty good? - I love it.
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:13.680]   - Lower back feels good? - Lower, everything feels,
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:15.160]   whole body got stronger, physique.
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:17.520]   - So what you're saying is you're gonna fuck up at Kara.
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:18.360]   (laughing)
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:20.040]   Is he training?
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:21.240]   - I'm not fighting.
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:23.480]   So I talked to Eric about it,
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:26.240]   and the truth is we're both concerned about head trauma.
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:27.880]   I haven't actually sparred.
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:30.100]   I like sparring, shadow boxing, but I go there,
[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:33.360]   I do personal training, I don't do a group class.
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:35.480]   I'm not fighting, I'm fighting the bag,
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:36.840]   I'm doing shadow boxing.
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:39.220]   My form is improving, but I haven't been punched.
[02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:40.440]   I get hit in the stomach, you know,
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:42.480]   I get hit in the side with kicks.
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:44.360]   Nobody's punched me in the face yet.
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:46.760]   So I think we both were adequately concerned about that,
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:48.900]   and there was not some ridiculous amount of money
[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:52.760]   on the table, so we decided it's just not worth pursuing.
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:55.480]   - How does Hikaru come into the picture?
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:58.320]   'Cause he's a possible competitor?
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:01.120]   - People ask me all the time, who would you fight?
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:03.960]   People are like, "Andrea Botez with 'Kick Your Ass.'"
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:05.760]   That's a tough one, 'cause I can't, what am I gonna say?
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:09.000]   I'm gonna fight a woman who I'm larger than,
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.200]   and so I just have to take the L against
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.800]   any time a woman is mentioned, that's fine.
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:14.280]   I'm like, oh, and six-- - There's no winning that one.
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:15.120]   - Right, exactly.
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:19.080]   So I've lost to both Botezes, Anna Rudolph, Anna Kremling,
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:20.320]   they're all chess creators.
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:22.080]   - And like hypothetically?
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:22.900]   - Yeah, I get a little bit of--
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:23.740]   - In this hypothetical fight?
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.200]   - Yeah, yeah. - Okay.
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:26.800]   - He's been training.
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:28.720]   I think, yeah, Andrea's been training.
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:30.440]   - That's because an event got announced.
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.720]   This event that I was hypothetically gonna be
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:34.480]   the main event against Eric Rosen.
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:35.320]   - Yeah.
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:36.160]   - That got announced? - Yeah.
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:38.280]   - And then you kinda like thought,
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:40.560]   like maybe let's not do this.
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:43.680]   - No, I knew once I declined to fight Eric
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:45.560]   that I would not be participating.
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:49.240]   And I even knew, I knew who was gonna be the main event,
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.400]   'cause I was kind of offered both of those guys.
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:53.240]   So Amon Hambleton--
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:54.720]   - Oh, is this still going on?
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.560]   - The chess boxing event will happen
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:58.080]   in December in Los Angeles, yeah.
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:46:59.640]   - Nice, so who is the main event?
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:02.560]   - It's Amon Hambleton, who's also Chessbrah.
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:04.080]   So they have a couple of guys
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:05.280]   that's part of the Chessbrah channel,
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:06.120]   and Lawrence Trent.
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:09.440]   Lawrence Trent is a international master from England.
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:14.040]   He's a, I think he's done some boxing a little bit.
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.520]   He's a commentator, brash guy.
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:17.360]   - Nice.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.440]   - Controversial guy, yeah.
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:20.480]   It's funny, 'cause they started,
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:21.520]   Lawrence put out some videos,
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:24.000]   and I went, damn, I should've done this.
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.480]   - Yeah, I think it.
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:27.880]   - But--
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:28.720]   - I mean, you're right.
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:30.280]   First of all, there's so many things to say,
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.240]   one of which is, if you wanna take it seriously,
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:36.520]   it does pull you in.
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.840]   If you train a lot, it's gonna affect
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:42.280]   the rest of your life, and then there's,
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:43.680]   it changes you, I think.
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.080]   Taking combat sports seriously changes you, in good,
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:49.720]   and there's negative costs to it, I think,
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:51.200]   'cause it's a whole 'nother thing, man.
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:53.960]   It's like doing marathon running or something.
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:55.080]   It really pulls you in.
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:58.440]   And the other thing is the head trauma.
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:00.080]   You have to take that kind of stuff seriously,
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:01.280]   especially if you're doing sparring
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:02.680]   and all that kind of stuff.
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:05.880]   Still, some of the celebrities,
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:08.240]   I don't know why, but it's pretty exciting.
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:11.120]   I don't know why it'd be fun to watch Hikaru.
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:11.960]   There's something--
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:13.880]   - Well, I always said, if Hikaru and Magnus
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:16.880]   did a boxing event, and I was the co-main event
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:20.520]   against I don't know who, that would be--
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:22.280]   - Has Magnus said anything about it?
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:24.480]   Like about doing chess boxing?
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:26.480]   - Well, first of all, he's gonna commentate
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:28.920]   the Ludwig event, which he said.
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:31.320]   He kind of said, "Oh, there's been people in the past
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:34.760]   "that are my level in chess," not my, his level in chess,
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:37.600]   "and have wanted to get physical with him."
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:40.120]   I think he's talking about Hikaru.
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:41.920]   I don't think anybody else is.
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:43.120]   That'd be a good one, man.
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:43.960]   That'd be a good one.
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:44.800]   I think Magnus--
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:45.620]   - What do you think?
[02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:46.460]   Who is that one?
[02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:49.520]   - I think Magnus is in better physical shape.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:52.200]   He's also a little bit bigger, I think, than Hikaru.
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.040]   - Longer reach.
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:54.760]   - I think Hikaru's a dog, though.
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:57.880]   I think he'll, I don't think he's gonna get out of that.
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:00.440]   Like, I don't think he's gonna quit in the ring.
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:03.320]   - I would think Hikaru just goes nuts in the beginning
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:04.400]   and burns himself out.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:07.000]   So if Magnus can survive that,
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:08.760]   I feel like Hikaru would just go crazy
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:09.920]   and then just get exhausted,
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:12.000]   would not be able to pace himself correctly.
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.200]   - Maybe, chasing that first round knockout.
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:16.800]   - Yeah, just swing like crazy.
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:19.160]   Honestly, I'd just love to see that,
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:23.560]   which is like the effect of physical exertion on the game.
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:26.800]   I'm sure they're strong enough to--
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:29.520]   - Yes, but I think we definitely underestimate
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.800]   the effect of being punched,
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:34.200]   maybe bleeding out of your nose or something like that.
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:35.600]   It's no joke.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.640]   I can't say I'm anticipating the first day
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:42.400]   I actually do some sparring and get seriously hit
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:44.940]   'cause I know it's not gonna feel good.
[02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:47.840]   Even now, I take a hard jab to the stomach or the ribs
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:49.720]   and I'm just like, man, this is rough.
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:53.540]   I mean, I had to do three minutes on heavy bag.
[02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:58.540]   And when I finished, I had been slacking on my form
[02:49:58.540 --> 02:50:02.000]   'cause my arms were tired and I hit with my fingers
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000]   instead of my knuckles and my hands are,
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.320]   like you can see the red skin,
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:08.720]   like completely pink, meaty skin under.
[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:10.280]   I didn't realize when I was hitting
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.280]   and only today the pain is unbearable.
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:15.000]   So I can't imagine, head?
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:15.880]   This must be--
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:18.320]   - No, I mean, it's a different thing.
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:20.080]   I mean, of course, your skin gets tougher,
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:22.040]   everything gets tougher, so you get used to it.
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.980]   The head is a weird one 'cause it's not gonna send you
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:26.440]   those kinds of signals.
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:29.200]   You're not gonna get the skin type of signals.
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:32.800]   The brain is a weird thing 'cause it doesn't hurt.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:33.920]   - Yeah.
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:36.400]   - It just does the damage and the damage can materialize
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:39.640]   itself, manifest itself only years later.
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:40.960]   It's a weird one.
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:42.720]   But then we all die.
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:44.460]   There's that brave heart speech.
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:47.040]   I gotta ask you about bots
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:48.880]   'cause to me it's super interesting
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:51.480]   and you've played a lot of bots at different levels.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:54.360]   You have a video called
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:57.920]   "The Advanced Chess Bots Are Terrifying."
[02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:01.160]   So what's the difference between playing humans and bots?
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:03.240]   Like you mentioned this Nelson bot.
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:04.080]   - Yeah.
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:06.800]   - That brings his queen out, I think rated 1600?
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:07.640]   - 1200 or 1400.
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:08.880]   - Okay, 1240.
[02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:11.040]   So there's a style to those.
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:14.000]   What's the difference between the way bots play
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:15.640]   and the way humans play?
[02:51:15.640 --> 02:51:17.880]   - A lot of people prefer playing bots
[02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:19.960]   because they have anxiety playing other humans.
[02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:21.320]   It's a very legitimate thing.
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:22.160]   - Interesting.
[02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:24.320]   - A lot of beginners, they don't like live chess.
[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:26.900]   They get nervous, you know, anxiety.
[02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:29.680]   You get close to your highest ever rating, you panic.
[02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:30.520]   Happens to me too.
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:31.360]   - Yeah.
[02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:33.120]   - Happens to me even now.
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:34.240]   So they play bots.
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:36.120]   - They're somehow more reliable or something?
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:38.120]   - Yeah, they're, I don't know.
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:39.560]   But that's, it's a big thing.
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:41.880]   It's a big thing and the popularity of that video
[02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:45.440]   shows that people enjoy watching you play chess bots.
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:49.320]   So I'm gonna demystify this.
[02:51:49.320 --> 02:51:50.500]   This might be shocking.
[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:54.880]   Those bots are all the same bot for the most part.
[02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:57.400]   You could just program a bot
[02:51:57.400 --> 02:52:00.280]   to make mistakes at a certain moment.
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:04.160]   You could program a bot to spend less time on certain moves.
[02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:06.760]   And it's gotten sophisticated enough
[02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:08.240]   that you can basically program it to play
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:12.480]   at whatever more or less level that a human plays at.
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:15.000]   You say, I'll play at an 1800 level.
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.560]   So it's programmed to throw in mistakes.
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:20.880]   The problem is, and this is why it's all beginners
[02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:22.720]   to not play bots,
[02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:25.440]   because bots are programmed in the following way.
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:29.160]   Beginner bots are like literal toddlers.
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.320]   They have no understanding whatsoever.
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:33.040]   They will literally lose all their pieces,
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:34.240]   but they won't lose all their pieces
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:35.640]   and make mistakes the way beginners do.
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:37.640]   Beginners actually know how to start a game.
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:42.120]   They just struggle the first eight moves, nine moves.
[02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:43.680]   Their mistakes are very different than bot.
[02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:46.400]   Bot plays completely outlandish types of mistakes
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:49.240]   that you cannot pick up in terms of a pattern standpoint
[02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:51.040]   'cause no actual humans play like that.
[02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:52.360]   They just move their queen to the opposite side
[02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:54.580]   of the board for no reason, and you can take it.
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:56.480]   - Yeah, it's not even a blunder.
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:52:57.880]   It's almost like randomness.
[02:52:57.880 --> 02:52:59.200]   - Yeah, it's completely random.
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.240]   And this problem extends further
[02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:04.200]   because advanced bots will play an opening
[02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:07.060]   completely reasonably, and they just hang a rook,
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:09.940]   which, okay, maybe happens,
[02:53:09.940 --> 02:53:12.080]   but that's not exactly how you get to 1800.
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:14.520]   At 1800, that's a very strong level of the game.
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:16.280]   You know your openings very well.
[02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:17.720]   You start navigating the middle game
[02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:20.340]   based on already things that you remember.
[02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:22.640]   And then basically one side chooses a bad plan,
[02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:24.160]   and the other side chooses a better plan,
[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:25.740]   and one thing leads to another.
[02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:28.560]   Nobody just recreationally hangs all their pieces,
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:30.520]   which is the way bots are kind of programmed to play.
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:33.280]   But some of those bots in that video were,
[02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:37.880]   I remember playing them, and they were, yeah, they were nuts.
[02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:39.520]   They were out calculating me every time
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.880]   I thought I had a trick in two, three second
[02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:43.280]   moment of thought.
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:45.000]   It would just play the best move.
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:46.200]   And sometimes that also happens.
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:47.800]   It gets into a dead loop
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:51.320]   where it just starts bulldozing you, and it can't stop.
[02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:53.200]   So it made its mistakes already.
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:55.380]   It's programmed to make only a few,
[02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.360]   and then it just bulldozes you the rest of the way.
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:58.200]   - Interesting.
[02:53:58.200 --> 02:54:02.180]   I mean, that's why I played with Stockfish a bunch.
[02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:04.800]   So I got,
[02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:10.720]   I built for myself a bunch of different chess experiments
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:11.560]   recently.
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:13.080]   It had to do with the chess playing bot,
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.000]   but I also built an infinite chess board
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.120]   where Stockfish was playing an infinite number
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:20.680]   of chess games.
[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:24.400]   And one of the parameters that was interesting to play with
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:27.520]   is how long it gets to think about a move
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.760]   and how that affects the rating of the thing.
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:31.720]   - Oh, I did that a little bit.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:32.960]   - So that's a tricky one.
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:34.500]   I'm sure people know how to do that well,
[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:37.560]   but it's not trivial to understand
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:41.040]   like what, there must be a good formula for it.
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:43.040]   But it's also interesting to think about
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:45.300]   like a controlled number of blunders.
[02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:50.520]   But it's probably better,
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:51.720]   the controlled number of blunders
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:54.040]   is not a good way to build a bot.
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:55.000]   - Yeah, it's, yeah.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.800]   - For training purposes, at least.
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:59.640]   - The time per move is probably better.
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:01.320]   But the craziest thing is I did that.
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:05.200]   A couple of my devs were helping me with the build,
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.740]   like I'm scaling my courses
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:10.520]   into a better chess learning platform, essentially.
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:13.360]   We've done a lot of different experiments with Stockfish,
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:15.320]   which I'm even happy to get into here.
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:19.640]   And Stockfish making moves in 0.1 millisecond
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:22.520]   plays better than a human, which is disgusting
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:24.960]   and disturbing, frankly, 'cause that's crazy.
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:27.640]   Like you can't react to a car stopping in front of you
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:29.000]   anywhere near that fast.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:30.320]   And yeah.
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:33.180]   - So the reason I was interested in that
[02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:35.720]   is because when you have a very large chess board,
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:37.840]   you have tens of thousands,
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:40.880]   hundreds of thousands of game going on at the same time.
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:44.800]   You have to think of the minimum amount
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:48.360]   of thinking per move that you can allow for.
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:51.760]   And it does seem, it's damn good,
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:53.280]   at least to my eye, basically,
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:56.560]   at the lowest possible setting you can give it.
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:58.520]   So yeah, it's incredible.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:55:59.880]   It's incredible what bots are able to do.
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:02.780]   And now it's, as far as I know,
[02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:05.540]   is primarily machine learning based, Stockfish.
[02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:07.900]   So Stockfish moved to machine learning completely.
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:10.980]   It's not doing search, as far as I know.
[02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:14.000]   - Yeah, this is where you lose me a bit,
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.540]   but the move discovery and evaluation
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:19.820]   is what's been changing in the way Stockfish works.
[02:56:19.820 --> 02:56:21.260]   So it's discovering of moves,
[02:56:21.260 --> 02:56:23.540]   and then the way it looks forward
[02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:25.840]   and then evaluates positions, that has changed.
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:29.940]   But Matthew Sadler, who wrote the book "Game Changer"
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:31.660]   about AlphaZero. - AlphaZero, yeah.
[02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:34.380]   - Yeah, he explains it significantly better.
[02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:36.600]   But that's the way I think it works.
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:38.660]   - What did that make you feel
[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:40.500]   when you first saw AlphaZero play?
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:41.340]   - I was excited.
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:45.740]   I didn't have any sort of existential thoughts.
[02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:49.160]   I enjoyed watching it completely destroy openings
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:51.120]   that people thought were good.
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.000]   And that experiment, though, does have some caveat
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.080]   in the sense that I think AlphaZero was playing
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:02.760]   with a full tank of servers, and I think Stockfish wasn't,
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:05.040]   which I think is one of the things people point out.
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:05.880]   They weren't playing--
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:06.960]   - Yeah, but since then, they were able
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:08.560]   to demonstrate much less.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:09.400]   - Yeah.
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:15.280]   - But also, AlphaZero stopped developing.
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:16.800]   They stopped developing it.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:18.040]   - Yes.
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:20.800]   - Which sucks, but again, from their perspective,
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:23.020]   from DeepMind's perspective, it's like, all right,
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:25.060]   well, we took on this really tricky game,
[02:57:25.060 --> 02:57:27.760]   did something honestly incredible.
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:28.600]   - They won.
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:30.400]   They won.
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:31.700]   - Well, not just won.
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:33.820]   I mean, they did it without any human supervision,
[02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:38.820]   so without any training on human expert games,
[02:57:38.820 --> 02:57:40.700]   so only through self-play, which,
[02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:43.820]   I mean, that's what learning is about.
[02:57:43.820 --> 02:57:47.460]   It's what you think of as a child, a human child, a toddler,
[02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:52.460]   learning from somewhat nothing and becoming a capable human.
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:57.900]   That's what we think of when we think about intelligence.
[02:57:57.900 --> 02:57:59.680]   So the fact that it's able to play itself
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:03.240]   and become the best player in the world at the game of Go
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:05.640]   in all kinds of games is just incredible,
[02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:08.600]   and obviously, that inspired the modern Stockfish
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:12.220]   to do all the same kind of self-play methods.
[02:58:12.220 --> 02:58:16.760]   Somebody on Reddit asked a pretty interesting question.
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:19.280]   I don't know if you have an interesting answer to it.
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:22.280]   What makes a chess move, quote-unquote, human?
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:26.440]   As you are someone, oh, this is to me,
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:28.960]   but it's mentioning you in third person.
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:30.560]   As you are someone working in AI,
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.640]   this idea of humanness would seem incredibly interesting.
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:37.360]   Yes, sir, it is, especially since most cheat detection
[02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:40.600]   relies on humanness as a way to detect cheaters.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:42.800]   I think since children being born right now
[02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:45.840]   will have the advantage of engine training their whole life,
[02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:49.120]   they will start to see the game the way an engine does.
[02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:50.680]   Will a person be considered a cheater
[02:58:50.680 --> 02:58:52.220]   if they play like an engine?
[02:58:52.220 --> 02:58:55.520]   There also seem to be a discrepancy,
[02:58:55.520 --> 02:58:57.880]   especially with Levy, about who can play
[02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:00.120]   what appears to be a non-human move.
[02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:02.280]   He often says things like, quote,
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:06.240]   "If you were a normal player," normal in quotes,
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:07.760]   "If you were a normal player,
[02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:11.600]   "I would think you were cheating, but since it's Magnus,
[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:12.940]   "I don't doubt Magnus is great,
[02:59:12.940 --> 02:59:14.400]   "but if humanness is our benchmark,
[02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:16.240]   "what is the ELO rating where your moves
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:19.320]   "can start to look like an engine without critique?"
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:21.120]   There's a bunch of questions in there.
[02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:24.080]   - They combine two of my quotes into one.
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:26.800]   So one thing that I like to say is,
[02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:29.080]   sometimes in a chess game, moves look,
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:31.360]   or an opening looks so ridiculous
[02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:34.060]   that if a viewer played it, I would make fun of them,
[02:59:34.060 --> 02:59:35.440]   or slap them, that's always the drill.
[02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:36.920]   If I was your chess coach, I'd smack you,
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:40.440]   but when Magnus plays it, we're just, oh, wow,
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:41.840]   you know, it's very different.
[02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:45.200]   So they mixed up this quote with another quote,
[02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:49.800]   which is, you know, if I,
[02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:52.480]   if I'll be explaining something and I'll say,
[02:59:52.480 --> 02:59:54.880]   oh, and here the engine says you should play like this.
[02:59:54.880 --> 02:59:57.000]   If one of your opponents plays like this,
[02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:58.540]   report them for cheating.
[02:59:58.540 --> 02:59:59.800]   So they fused two quotes.
[02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:02.200]   They said, oh, human can't play like that,
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:04.260]   but because it's an engine move,
[03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.680]   but because Magnus is playing.
[03:00:05.680 --> 03:00:07.760]   So they mixed kind of two things.
[03:00:07.760 --> 03:00:11.080]   - But there's interesting levels of humor
[03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:14.520]   and insight there on both of those.
[03:00:14.520 --> 03:00:17.240]   - Yeah, the difference between human move and engine,
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:20.480]   and like what an engine move is, is I think two things.
[03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:25.480]   Number one, a computer move is outlandish
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:31.440]   in its concept and its idea.
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:35.480]   So the best example that I can give of that
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:37.840]   is if you gave a hundred grandmasters a position
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:40.040]   and told them, you know, what do you think
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:41.200]   the best move here is for black?
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:43.240]   Not in this position right here, we have nothing,
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:45.760]   but an overwhelming amount of them would look
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:47.920]   at the position, evaluate everything they know
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:50.060]   about the game of chess, which is relatively similar,
[03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:52.240]   but obviously slightly imbalanced
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:53.640]   based on their skill level.
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:55.040]   And they would come up with a sample size
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:56.720]   of two or three moves.
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:00:59.940]   And in comes the computer with a fucking haymaker.
[03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:01.340]   And suddenly everybody goes,
[03:01:01.340 --> 03:01:05.040]   oh, everything we know about chess has gone out the window.
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:06.280]   So they all start looking at that move
[03:01:06.280 --> 03:01:07.120]   and they know it's the best move.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:08.520]   So now they start adding the evidence
[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:12.920]   behind the verdict, as opposed to getting to the verdict
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:15.100]   while first looking at the evidence.
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:19.400]   So the concept of it and the idea of it is so outlandish
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:21.800]   based on a certain type of position
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:23.640]   that you can't fully grasp it.
[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:25.780]   You have to continue to beg the engine
[03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:28.040]   to tell you what the variation is.
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:30.920]   A move is only good if its extension is good.
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:32.480]   That's the way chess works.
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:34.600]   So it's like a move is good,
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:36.320]   it's because the computer has seen
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:39.280]   that the various branches of things going forward
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:40.280]   are also good.
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:41.340]   So you bring all that back.
[03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:44.040]   And no human could have even conceptualized
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:45.520]   that initial thing.
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:47.800]   But the second thing about computer moves is
[03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:50.440]   they look counterintuitive.
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:54.280]   So that's a, if you might be in a position
[03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:59.280]   where it looks like the demands of the position are A, B, C,
[03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:01.800]   and then the computer is like, nope, it's not
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:03.320]   because I've seen the future way more
[03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:04.280]   than you possibly could have.
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:05.520]   And I don't have emotions.
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:07.200]   (laughing)
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:10.840]   - So like dumb moves and brilliant moves can look similar.
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:13.080]   - Yes, and oftentimes do.
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:14.960]   And this is actually back to the Hans thing.
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:18.000]   A lot of people now dissecting these games they're playing
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:21.280]   and they're basically saying, like even Fabiano Caruana,
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:22.120]   one of the best players in the world
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:25.480]   was on his podcast yesterday basically saying,
[03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:27.200]   okay, this is beyond my level.
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:29.080]   Saying, it's out of my league.
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:29.920]   - Yeah.
[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:30.740]   - What's out of your league?
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:31.580]   You played for the world championship.
[03:02:31.580 --> 03:02:33.480]   Can we get what, we can read between the lines, right?
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:34.320]   It's--
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:36.760]   - Is it possible that Hans is that level of genius?
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:41.760]   Is there like different kinds of genius?
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:46.760]   Like where one, you could be out of each other's league
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:48.200]   kind of thing?
[03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:49.120]   - Maybe.
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:52.840]   In the case of Magnus, it's understanding of end games.
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:56.000]   It's just somehow he understands that last phase
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:57.400]   of the game and the complexities
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:59.440]   and the problems he can pose better than anybody else.
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:04.440]   - So you can see Magnus do poor looking moves
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:06.280]   in the end game.
[03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:07.120]   - Or--
[03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:11.360]   - Like moves that don't fit what your gut says
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:13.900]   is would be the optimal.
[03:03:13.900 --> 03:03:18.200]   - Yes, but also, so it's not that you even think
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:19.040]   they're right.
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:21.280]   You just might not even consider them
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:23.720]   because of over-reliance on your own information
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:24.540]   or even the computer.
[03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:26.840]   That was what was going on in game six.
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:28.600]   Just kept doing things and kept playing
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:31.320]   and kept finding play and posing those questions
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.280]   that humans and computers could not understand.
[03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:36.360]   So he beat the engine basically.
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:37.840]   He wouldn't have beaten the engine
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:39.320]   'cause it would have defended.
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:42.720]   Jan lost that game in the '90s move psychologically.
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:44.440]   He thought the game was over, so that contributed.
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:45.800]   Computer would have defended.
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:47.880]   - So by the time this podcast comes out,
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:49.140]   which I don't know, it would be in a week
[03:03:49.140 --> 03:03:51.800]   or something like that, I feel like more will happen.
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:54.240]   Let's see your predicting engine.
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:58.120]   How does this Hans drama end saga?
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:02.200]   Like let's look in three months.
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:04.480]   By the time we get to the next world championship,
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:09.480]   let's say, what are the options?
[03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:12.400]   Let's imagine, let's not say like what the probabilities are.
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:13.460]   What are the options?
[03:04:13.460 --> 03:04:19.560]   Chess.com is forced to or agrees to or whatever
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:21.160]   to come up with a huge amount of evidence
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:22.440]   of cheating in the past.
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:26.160]   Or Hans comes out.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.680]   What can Hans do with this?
[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:32.800]   So I'm uncomfortable with the general,
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:35.160]   Nick, you can maybe update me on this,
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:37.960]   but there was a little bit of an attack on him,
[03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:41.680]   a lot of an attack that he's a cheater, right?
[03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:45.080]   Without evidence, without clear conclusive evidence.
[03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:46.780]   - Physical evidence.
[03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:47.900]   - Physical evidence.
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:49.280]   So all of those.
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:51.280]   - Right, that's the tricky thing.
[03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:53.960]   - Yeah, so like that stuff we're talking about
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:55.880]   is beyond my level.
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:05:00.880]   That starts being kind of intuitive circumstantial evidence.
[03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:04.920]   - There's the statistical evidence
[03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:08.160]   behind the over the board games that he's played in 2020,
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:13.160]   2021, where the games match what's called engine correlation
[03:05:13.160 --> 03:05:17.740]   more than Magnus and many other top grandmasters combined.
[03:05:17.740 --> 03:05:22.080]   But that can be argued is because he was very strong
[03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:23.480]   in playing weaker opposition.
[03:05:23.480 --> 03:05:25.200]   So there's always kind of this argument
[03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:26.560]   against statistics, right?
[03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:30.040]   There's the fact that the guy who Magnus name dropped,
[03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:31.360]   Maxim Blugi.
[03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:34.120]   Blugi is a chess grandmaster,
[03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:35.360]   and he's even been, I think,
[03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:37.040]   president of the US Chess Federation.
[03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:39.160]   I've played him in some Blitz games.
[03:05:39.160 --> 03:05:41.440]   It turns out, I wasn't even fully aware
[03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:42.280]   of the extent of this.
[03:05:42.280 --> 03:05:44.880]   He has been banned from chess.com.
[03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:45.700]   - For cheating.
[03:05:45.700 --> 03:05:46.540]   - For cheating.
[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:49.400]   - Have they actually, has him and Hans actually worked?
[03:05:49.400 --> 03:05:50.280]   - Yes.
[03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:51.840]   So that was why he named dropped that, right?
[03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:52.880]   That's also not good.
[03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:55.320]   You see where this is getting,
[03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:56.760]   you still don't have the physical proof,
[03:05:56.760 --> 03:05:59.180]   but you have smoke.
[03:05:59.180 --> 03:06:01.680]   So I don't know how this ends.
[03:06:01.680 --> 03:06:02.520]   I don't know if this,
[03:06:02.520 --> 03:06:05.720]   if he denies it to the death
[03:06:05.720 --> 03:06:08.920]   and he ends up filing some sort of legal action,
[03:06:08.920 --> 03:06:10.960]   some sort of ethics complaint,
[03:06:10.960 --> 03:06:12.160]   or he admits everything.
[03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:15.400]   I don't know.
[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:16.720]   - Boy, well, no matter what,
[03:06:16.720 --> 03:06:19.040]   I hope despite chess or not,
[03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:22.040]   that he's mentally strong enough for whatever is to come.
[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:22.880]   - That's what I keep saying because I--
[03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:24.080]   - He's been under fire, right?
[03:06:24.080 --> 03:06:25.400]   - Yeah, I can't imagine, right?
[03:06:25.400 --> 03:06:27.040]   Like I just, I really can't imagine.
[03:06:27.040 --> 03:06:29.120]   And maybe, well, we just have too much compassion,
[03:06:29.120 --> 03:06:29.960]   but I don't think so.
[03:06:29.960 --> 03:06:31.320]   I really just feel like,
[03:06:31.320 --> 03:06:34.360]   at the end of the day, chess is just a game,
[03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:37.720]   but it is a game played by millions of people
[03:06:37.720 --> 03:06:39.320]   throughout history,
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:43.460]   and nations have basically fought wars over the chessboard.
[03:06:43.460 --> 03:06:46.920]   So like, there's a lot.
[03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:47.860]   It's like Olympics.
[03:06:47.860 --> 03:06:49.120]   Olympics is just a little,
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:50.760]   "Oh, this dude running and so on."
[03:06:50.760 --> 03:06:52.720]   Hockey is just a thing with a puck,
[03:06:52.720 --> 03:06:54.240]   and, but you know.
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:58.640]   It's also much more than that.
[03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:01.480]   It's also nations
[03:07:01.480 --> 03:07:06.840]   sort of figuring out their conflict
[03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:09.440]   in a way that doesn't involve violence.
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:11.640]   Yeah, it's a serious thing,
[03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:16.360]   and it's a thing that inspires millions of people,
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:19.800]   and it's a testing ground for intelligent systems
[03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:23.640]   that eventually take over human civilization.
[03:07:23.640 --> 03:07:25.040]   - Yeah, I know.
[03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:27.640]   - Yeah, I mean, the bots are really interesting.
[03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:28.960]   I don't know if there's other lessons.
[03:07:28.960 --> 03:07:31.600]   Like you played a clone of yourself.
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:32.440]   - Nah, it was.
[03:07:32.440 --> 03:07:35.840]   - You watched Stockfish versus Stockfish.
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:37.600]   You have a video.
[03:07:37.600 --> 03:07:38.440]   People should check out your channel.
[03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:39.840]   You have a lot of awesome videos.
[03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:41.960]   You have a video titled Stockfish versus Stockfish.
[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:43.820]   - That was the experiment.
[03:07:43.820 --> 03:07:45.760]   I made them play each other.
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:46.600]   So I made them play--
[03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:48.640]   - What did you learn from that experiment?
[03:07:49.640 --> 03:07:53.240]   - Ah, I enjoyed, first of all, they will always make a draw.
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:55.320]   So engines don't get to play each other
[03:07:55.320 --> 03:07:58.360]   from a beginning position because they will always draw,
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:07:59.920]   especially if they're the same engine.
[03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:01.440]   So Stockfish 15, Stockfish 15,
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:05.280]   I don't think one side will ever beat the other, basically.
[03:08:05.280 --> 03:08:08.560]   But if you program them to play a certain opening position,
[03:08:08.560 --> 03:08:10.360]   according to chess theory,
[03:08:10.360 --> 03:08:13.600]   you get to see interesting ways into how they evaluate.
[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:15.480]   One of the things, one of the ways that it played
[03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:18.120]   against the London opening was absurd.
[03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:20.360]   Like it just, it was completely ridiculous.
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:23.080]   Black sacrificed two pawns as early as move six,
[03:08:23.080 --> 03:08:25.820]   which is a borderline completely lost position.
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:29.440]   And then both sides foresaw that the only way white
[03:08:29.440 --> 03:08:32.080]   was gonna be able to use that material advantage
[03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:35.120]   was to give it back and stabilize their own position.
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:37.640]   Like black just got a crazy attack.
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:40.080]   Jesus Christ, this is crazy.
[03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:41.360]   But they drew them and they ended up drawing.
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:44.400]   So I'm also gonna make them play against each other
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:47.240]   in either bad openings
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:49.280]   or like some of the most popular gambits,
[03:08:49.280 --> 03:08:52.400]   looking at something like that.
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:55.680]   And the way I'm gonna do this is basically say,
[03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:58.320]   which chess gambits are the best?
[03:08:58.320 --> 03:09:00.120]   And the way I'm gonna do that is,
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:03.800]   theoretically, the engine should be able to beat a gambit
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.460]   because a gambit is very rarely blessed by the computer.
[03:09:07.460 --> 03:09:12.000]   So if the computer cannot beat that gambit,
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.600]   that means it's good.
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:14.440]   That means it's not losing.
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:17.360]   If it's a completely lost gambit, it will beat it.
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:21.300]   But if it draws, despite getting that early disadvantage,
[03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:23.200]   then that means the gambit is very reliable
[03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:24.440]   and you can play it.
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:27.640]   - So that's a good way to evaluate opening games.
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:29.200]   - Yeah.
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:30.240]   - What's the best?
[03:09:30.240 --> 03:09:31.680]   What's your favorite opening?
[03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:36.000]   Or what openings do you like?
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:39.760]   - There was an opening that got me back into chess
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:40.600]   when I was 15.
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:41.800]   I had quit for like three years
[03:09:41.800 --> 03:09:43.080]   and I went to my friend's house
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:46.640]   and he had a book by Lars Skendorf,
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:49.600]   a Danish grandmaster called "The Karakhan Defense,"
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:51.840]   which is C6.
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:53.520]   - Do you want white or do you want black?
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:55.040]   Do you wanna show the opening?
[03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:56.360]   - This is the opening.
[03:09:56.360 --> 03:09:57.180]   - That's it. - "The Karakhan Defense."
[03:09:57.180 --> 03:10:00.200]   So you play, before I play C6, I have to play black.
[03:10:00.200 --> 03:10:01.040]   - That's it.
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:03.680]   - Yeah, and we develop from here.
[03:10:03.680 --> 03:10:04.520]   I put my D points.
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:07.080]   - But what counts as an opening?
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:10.760]   Okay, but the development, does the development matter?
[03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:11.640]   - Yeah, so from here,
[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:14.400]   the development goes into the variations of the Karakhan.
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:16.360]   So this is the Karakhan.
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:17.840]   Like you can be in a city,
[03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:19.680]   but then you can be in neighborhoods.
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:21.880]   - That's a very non-dramatic, okay.
[03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:23.000]   - Yeah.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:24.200]   Two pawns in the center.
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:26.040]   So that's called the Breyer variation.
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:28.360]   - So what's a good thing for me?
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:29.200]   - Two squares, yeah.
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:31.400]   If you can put two pawns in the center, yeah, you should.
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:32.240]   And then--
[03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:33.060]   - So that's a good thing.
[03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:34.560]   - Yes, and then I will go here.
[03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:36.120]   And now you have to decide what you're gonna do
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:37.880]   with your center pawn.
[03:10:37.880 --> 03:10:40.320]   You can push, take, or defend it.
[03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:43.600]   - And push, take, or defend, right.
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:44.440]   - Yeah.
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:45.840]   - What would you suggest?
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:47.400]   Take is the worst?
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:49.480]   - Take is just stable, so we just trade.
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:51.960]   But pushing is considered the best,
[03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:55.000]   advancing and taking my space away from me.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.040]   So I think alpha zero or stockfish
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:59.240]   would probably always push.
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:00.080]   - Push.
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:02.560]   - And now there's something called like
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:04.000]   the main line or the sideline.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.320]   Main line is what's the most popular played at all levels,
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:08.160]   which is moving the bishop here.
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:09.520]   I've played this a lot.
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:12.880]   But for beginners, and intermediate players,
[03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:14.600]   this is why I love this opening so much.
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:17.520]   On move three, black already has a plus score,
[03:11:17.520 --> 03:11:19.960]   which is crazy.
[03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:21.360]   It's not supposed to happen.
[03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:24.480]   And there's this very tricky second most popular move,
[03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:25.800]   which is undermining your center,
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:27.800]   trying to get you to take my free pawn,
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:30.800]   but destabilize and leave both of them kind of hanging.
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:34.400]   - Is that why the plus score?
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:37.840]   Is because you're susceptible to the destabilization?
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:42.040]   - Yes, because people at 99% of the rating ladder
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:45.480]   do not understand how to deal with what's coming basically.
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:49.000]   They don't know how to deal with a structural attack.
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.880]   - So would stockfish try to defend the pawn here
[03:11:51.880 --> 03:11:52.720]   and keep the structure?
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:54.640]   - No, it would take the pawn and tell you to go fuck yourself.
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:55.480]   - Oh.
[03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:56.320]   (laughing)
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:11:57.160]   I knew that.
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:11:58.200]   'Cause I am 3,400.
[03:11:58.200 --> 03:11:59.040]   - Right.
[03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:02.000]   It would take the pawn and be like, all right, win it back.
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:03.920]   And even if you did, you would suffer.
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:05.600]   It would make you win it back in the most annoying way.
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:06.920]   It would make you tie your shoes together.
[03:12:06.920 --> 03:12:08.400]   And block it.
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:10.960]   - So I, like as stockfish, I would take.
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:11.800]   - Yes.
[03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:12.880]   That's the best move.
[03:12:12.880 --> 03:12:13.720]   - That's the best move.
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:18.040]   - But not at 99% of the rating ladder, which is funny.
[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:18.880]   - Interesting.
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:23.120]   But you like to play this.
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:24.800]   - I play this against GMs.
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:25.640]   I play both.
[03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:26.480]   I move my bishop.
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:27.400]   I push the-
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:29.400]   - What are the different ways it evolves?
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:30.720]   Like then the rest doesn't matter.
[03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:33.640]   So this is just like a pawn structure thing.
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:34.480]   - Yeah.
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:35.320]   And I mean, it, again-
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:37.320]   - How deep are most openings?
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:39.080]   So it's anywhere from like two moves
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:40.400]   to like 10 moves kind of thing?
[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:41.240]   - Yeah.
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:43.000]   You can be out of theory very, very quickly.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:44.120]   Two move, two move, three.
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:46.480]   Like basically on your own, you have a general idea,
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:47.680]   but you don't remember games.
[03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:51.000]   I mean, I know Caro-Kann games from start to finish
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.240]   because I've played it since 2011.
[03:12:53.240 --> 03:12:54.680]   - So you know all the different branches
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:55.600]   that goes with that down.
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:56.440]   - Yeah.
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:58.920]   I think I know every opening in chess, basically.
[03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:02.600]   I think most title players know every opening,
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:05.360]   but we don't know, we can't play it competitively
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:06.880]   because we'd be, but-
[03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:08.920]   - What are some of the weirder openings
[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:13.920]   that like slightly suboptimal, but might be explored?
[03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:19.640]   Like Magnus might play them
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:21.200]   just to fuck with the opponent.
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:23.320]   - He played something recently actually
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:26.600]   against this German prodigy, Vincent Keimer,
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:31.240]   which was a specific move order
[03:13:31.240 --> 03:13:33.360]   in a very popular opening.
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:34.520]   So it was basically a position
[03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:36.300]   that had been reached thousands of times,
[03:13:36.300 --> 03:13:39.860]   but the move order Magnus chose with white
[03:13:39.860 --> 03:13:43.800]   was played maybe 0.05% of the time,
[03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:46.040]   which is crazy, it's thousands of games.
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:47.720]   And it's supposed to be not good,
[03:13:47.720 --> 03:13:49.840]   meaning it allows black to equalize
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:51.840]   'cause that's what black is going for.
[03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:55.240]   Not winning the game, but equalizing 'cause you go second.
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:13:57.320]   Magnus says, "I don't care about equalizing.
[03:13:57.320 --> 03:13:58.160]   I just want a position.
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:01.660]   I don't want my opponent to know the answers to the test."
[03:14:01.660 --> 03:14:04.720]   - That's so interesting.
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:06.600]   'Cause it also fucks you psychologically.
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:09.680]   It throws you off and just always keep you on your toes.
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:10.840]   He's in a weird position,
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:13.760]   but he also has the advantage of being able to intimidate.
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:16.280]   I wonder how many people,
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:19.240]   how much is that a role of it?
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:21.240]   Like being scared of the other person?
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:22.720]   - It's a huge role, I think.
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:24.320]   I think some of the top guys would deny it,
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:27.280]   but you know when you're in the seventh hour
[03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:29.080]   and you're playing Magnus,
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:31.480]   it's a very different feeling than some of the other.
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:33.360]   When Magnus is messing around in the opening,
[03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:35.480]   it's very different than another person
[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:36.600]   messing around in the opening.
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:41.600]   You just kind of like expect for something to be there.
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:44.520]   We'll see if it translates to poker for him,
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:47.100]   but I think he gets a little bit maybe less respect
[03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:47.940]   in the poker world.
[03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:49.120]   In the chess world, he's sort of alpha.
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:50.160]   - He gets a lot of respect.
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:51.800]   I just talked to Daniel Negreanu.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:56.200]   The only person that doesn't respect Magnus Carlsen
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:00.280]   honestly either in chess or poker is Magnus Carlsen.
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:01.440]   - I was gonna say Hans Niemann.
[03:15:01.440 --> 03:15:02.680]   (laughing)
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:03.520]   - That's true.
[03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:05.680]   But like Magnus is hilarious.
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:07.080]   I mean, when he talks about his rating,
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:08.440]   he's like, "It was pretty good."
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:10.280]   When he talks about how good he is at poker,
[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:11.720]   "I suck."
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:15.000]   But I think that self-critical view,
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:19.000]   I think he honestly believes to a degree
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:22.240]   is probably part of the engine that fuels him
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:23.760]   to get better and better and better and better.
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:26.280]   - Yeah, but what I'm saying is if you're face-to-face
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:27.240]   with Magnus at a chess board,
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:29.440]   it's not the same as being in a nine-handed poker table
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:30.280]   with him.
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:31.240]   You kind of keep an eye on him maybe
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:32.720]   and then he's a mysterious guy,
[03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:34.520]   but chess is different 'cause you're like,
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:36.120]   "This is the man."
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:37.760]   - Yeah, there's very few people.
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:41.080]   Yeah, so in poker, they talk about Phil Ivey that way.
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:41.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:15:41.920 --> 03:15:43.400]   - As like this super intimidating.
[03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:45.120]   I think that's,
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:49.860]   it's probably harder to intimidate in poker.
[03:15:49.860 --> 03:15:52.560]   Actually, I don't know.
[03:15:52.560 --> 03:15:53.400]   I don't know.
[03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:55.320]   There's something intimidating about
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:15:59.720]   excellence in a deterministic game
[03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:00.920]   that's just terrifying.
[03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:04.080]   I mean, it's like playing stockfish.
[03:16:04.080 --> 03:16:06.400]   You're fucked.
[03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:08.600]   This thing will suffocate you,
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:11.400]   and especially when it makes moves
[03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:12.700]   that you don't understand.
[03:16:12.700 --> 03:16:15.360]   To me, the most beautiful thing, honestly,
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:19.360]   is the sacrifices that the engines do.
[03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:23.560]   It's such a fuck you.
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:25.760]   Like I could sacrifice pieces,
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:27.800]   and I'll get 'em back, and I'll get 'em back more,
[03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:28.640]   and I could look--
[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:30.120]   - I don't even have to get them back.
[03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:32.720]   Your position is so bad, I gave you full material,
[03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:34.600]   and there's nothing you can do about it, yeah.
[03:16:34.600 --> 03:16:35.880]   - That's terrifying.
[03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:36.720]   - Yeah.
[03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:37.560]   - That's terrifying.
[03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:40.800]   That transfers to AI systems in general,
[03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:45.040]   like a system that plays weak
[03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:48.060]   just to fool you.
[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:55.760]   For people who are trying to get better at chess,
[03:16:55.760 --> 03:16:58.800]   beginners or at any stage of their development,
[03:16:58.800 --> 03:17:01.280]   what advice would you give about getting better?
[03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:05.080]   Except watch your channel.
[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:06.720]   - Yeah, of course, watch my videos.
[03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:08.080]   Check out Chessly.com.
[03:17:08.080 --> 03:17:10.380]   That's where we're gonna scale the courses to.
[03:17:10.380 --> 03:17:13.960]   But no, on a serious note,
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:17.720]   you have to be prepared to lose way more than win.
[03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:22.680]   My mom gave me advice when I was maybe 13 or 14,
[03:17:22.680 --> 03:17:26.200]   and I just discovered that I liked girls.
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:28.760]   She said, "You're gonna get a lot more no's in life
[03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:29.720]   "than yeses."
[03:17:29.720 --> 03:17:33.040]   That even happened with my wife, actually.
[03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:35.800]   Our whole journey is quite fascinating.
[03:17:35.800 --> 03:17:37.400]   - It's paved with rejection?
[03:17:37.400 --> 03:17:40.680]   - Paved with, yes, various ghostings
[03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:41.680]   over the course of years,
[03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:43.800]   but we got married, and we love each other very much,
[03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:47.160]   so it's a wonderful tale.
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:49.720]   But it's the same in chess.
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:51.400]   You're gonna lose a lot,
[03:17:51.400 --> 03:17:55.200]   and you have to be, for adults, I noticed,
[03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:56.720]   kids and adults learn chess very differently.
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:17:59.440]   Kids yell out in class, and they're very excited,
[03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:00.520]   and they don't realize how many times
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:01.960]   they get something wrong.
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:04.800]   Adults never wanna talk during lessons,
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:06.200]   'cause they're afraid of being wrong.
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:07.920]   Adults will preface correct answers
[03:18:07.920 --> 03:18:09.600]   with, "This is probably wrong,"
[03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:14.000]   but shut up, you're paying for a private lesson.
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.200]   This is the place to be wrong.
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:19.240]   So adults especially think that being dominant
[03:18:19.240 --> 03:18:21.600]   in a career where they've dedicated
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:22.760]   a lot of their brain power,
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:23.920]   a lot of their work ethic,
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:25.040]   and a lot of their study time,
[03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:26.280]   it's gonna translate to chess.
[03:18:26.280 --> 03:18:27.520]   They do it to their own kids.
[03:18:27.520 --> 03:18:28.600]   They helicopter their own kids,
[03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:31.640]   'cause they try to apply a lot of the same stuff.
[03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:34.600]   Studying chess is different than studying anything else.
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:35.440]   Anything else.
[03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:39.280]   Same could be argued for martial arts, I guess, but--
[03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:40.120]   - Yeah, 100%.
[03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:41.400]   You have to have a beginner's mind,
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:43.880]   and what that actually means is sucking
[03:18:43.880 --> 03:18:46.040]   in every aspect of the game,
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:49.360]   and studying all the interesting ways in which you suck.
[03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:51.880]   - And you will realize you get better
[03:18:51.880 --> 03:18:53.440]   without actually trying to get better.
[03:18:53.440 --> 03:18:54.840]   I show up to the boxing gym one day,
[03:18:54.840 --> 03:18:56.320]   I move my hips better.
[03:18:56.320 --> 03:18:58.280]   And I would do shadow boxing,
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:00.280]   sensei goes, "You're moving your feet better today.
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:01.120]   "You got better."
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:02.720]   I'm like, "I didn't practice footwork."
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:05.480]   Your brain just starts putting it all together randomly.
[03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:08.280]   You might study a shitload and still lose 100 points.
[03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:09.680]   If you're gonna study chess,
[03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:10.800]   oh, and for fuck's sake,
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:14.120]   this is the only activity where people go in going,
[03:19:14.120 --> 03:19:16.600]   "How much do I have to work to be a grandmaster?"
[03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:18.560]   Nowhere else in my life have I ever seen someone
[03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:21.920]   try to pick up a hobby and wanna be the top-ranking level.
[03:19:21.920 --> 03:19:23.400]   Only in chess.
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:26.120]   - You're right, but for example,
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:28.280]   when I, like grappling sports,
[03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:32.080]   I'll see people come to a gym and basically ask,
[03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:35.760]   how long before I can get into the UFC, right?
[03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:38.000]   But UFC champion is different.
[03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:39.680]   I mean, no, grandmaster is equivalent
[03:19:39.680 --> 03:19:41.560]   to getting into the UFC.
[03:19:42.760 --> 03:19:44.440]   - I guess, yeah.
[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:48.480]   - But people quickly realize when the 110-pound girl
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:49.720]   taps them out over and over,
[03:19:49.720 --> 03:19:54.480]   and they're a 230-pound ripped dude,
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:19:58.160]   they realize, okay, this is an art, this is a journey.
[03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:01.260]   And I think if you resist the lessons
[03:20:01.260 --> 03:20:03.400]   that failure teaches you, that's when you don't grow.
[03:20:03.400 --> 03:20:06.280]   So just relax.
[03:20:06.280 --> 03:20:08.120]   And one of the things you have to learn,
[03:20:08.120 --> 03:20:09.920]   probably applies to chess too,
[03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:13.360]   is to know how to relax your body, your mind.
[03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:16.520]   And just like, there's something about,
[03:20:16.520 --> 03:20:19.520]   just like you said, if you don't resist it,
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:22.680]   if you relax, then your body, your mind
[03:20:22.680 --> 03:20:24.720]   will learn the way of this game.
[03:20:24.720 --> 03:20:31.000]   And probably add to that is just put a lot of hours in
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:32.240]   of having fun.
[03:20:32.240 --> 03:20:36.720]   But then on that Perpetual Chess Podcast,
[03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:38.880]   I listened to somebody that say,
[03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:40.520]   it doesn't, like puzzles, none of that,
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:43.160]   what matters is the number of hours you spend
[03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:44.220]   kind of suffering.
[03:20:44.220 --> 03:20:47.080]   Meaning like thinking deeply.
[03:20:47.080 --> 03:20:51.840]   Like straining, like thinking with your mind,
[03:20:51.840 --> 03:20:53.040]   like really working hard.
[03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:56.500]   And then you have the Magnus who says,
[03:20:56.500 --> 03:20:58.240]   no, what matters is the number of hours
[03:20:58.240 --> 03:20:59.380]   you spend having fun.
[03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:02.600]   - Yeah, it's a mix, it's a mix.
[03:21:02.600 --> 03:21:05.000]   He's right, I don't quite agree with suffering,
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.800]   but I think people do a lot of fake learning.
[03:21:07.800 --> 03:21:12.120]   They play speed games, they just go through tactics.
[03:21:12.120 --> 03:21:13.900]   So, okay, I have to do 20 tactics.
[03:21:13.900 --> 03:21:16.440]   Okay, boop, wrong, next one.
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:21.320]   I used to tell my students, you need to do 10 puzzles
[03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:23.480]   and you need to get 100% correct.
[03:21:23.480 --> 03:21:25.280]   I don't care how long it takes.
[03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:28.820]   So I suppose that kind of is like the suffering theory.
[03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:33.080]   But if you do 30 puzzles and you get eight correct,
[03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:35.240]   what even is that?
[03:21:35.240 --> 03:21:40.240]   That's laughable in the correct amount of,
[03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:43.960]   what is it, 29%, I don't know, but 26%.
[03:21:43.960 --> 03:21:46.120]   You can't do that, you have to get things right
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:47.320]   and that's the only way you're actually--
[03:21:47.320 --> 03:21:48.800]   - And that requires like thinking deeply
[03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:50.200]   and like really struggling.
[03:21:50.200 --> 03:21:51.980]   Especially if you're doing the puzzles at the level
[03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:54.360]   that that's your level.
[03:21:54.360 --> 03:21:57.200]   - I've done a puzzle for an hour before
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:21:58.840]   'cause I was so stubborn.
[03:21:58.840 --> 03:22:00.680]   I didn't wanna just put in a wrong answer.
[03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:03.960]   - Yeah, the guy I was listening to said like, that's good.
[03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:04.800]   You should do that.
[03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:05.620]   - That would be for me.
[03:22:05.620 --> 03:22:07.440]   And the same with blindfold chess, I have to say.
[03:22:07.440 --> 03:22:09.560]   Like my blindfold skills, I never practice.
[03:22:09.560 --> 03:22:11.880]   I just, I can visualize the board quite well.
[03:22:11.880 --> 03:22:16.200]   I've played, at most I've played four games blindfolded
[03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:17.280]   at the same time.
[03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:19.720]   That sucks, that just feels horrible in the brain afterward.
[03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:23.280]   But like I can play four simultaneous games.
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:24.120]   - Blindfolded?
[03:22:24.120 --> 03:22:24.940]   - Yeah.
[03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:25.840]   - What's that take to do that?
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:26.680]   - I don't know.
[03:22:26.680 --> 03:22:27.720]   And I get asked that all the time.
[03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:28.560]   How do I practice?
[03:22:28.560 --> 03:22:31.320]   Why the fuck would you do that to yourself?
[03:22:31.320 --> 03:22:32.160]   There's no need.
[03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:33.000]   - It's a good party trick.
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:34.800]   - It is, yes, it is.
[03:22:34.800 --> 03:22:37.080]   The video of Magnus doing it in Columbus Circle
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:40.160]   on YouTube has like, I don't know how many views.
[03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:42.040]   I did it live with an announcer.
[03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:43.600]   I can't imagine how chaotic that was,
[03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:46.720]   but he, yeah, it's a great party trick.
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:47.720]   - Yeah.
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:49.560]   Oh, there is a Reddit thing.
[03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:53.360]   I forgot to ask Magnus, but they asked me to ask him
[03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:55.240]   'cause they moved the wrong piece.
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:22:56.360]   - Yes.
[03:22:56.360 --> 03:22:57.640]   And then somehow he remembered.
[03:22:57.640 --> 03:23:00.600]   I don't know how that happened, I have to tell you.
[03:23:00.600 --> 03:23:03.920]   - I kind of presume that he figured out
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:05.880]   from the way the other person was moving
[03:23:05.880 --> 03:23:07.840]   that they moved the wrong piece.
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:09.320]   Yeah, I forgot to ask him that.
[03:23:09.320 --> 03:23:10.160]   - Yeah.
[03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:11.000]   - Why did I forget?
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:12.320]   I mean, my memory sucks.
[03:23:12.320 --> 03:23:18.760]   You said, you know, ups and downs in your childhood,
[03:23:18.760 --> 03:23:20.040]   a little rough sometimes.
[03:23:20.040 --> 03:23:23.000]   Also, you get attacked by the beautiful,
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:24.680]   wonderful people on the internet.
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:25.520]   - Sure.
[03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:26.600]   - So sometimes it's difficult.
[03:23:26.600 --> 03:23:30.200]   What's been the lowest point that you've ever gone to
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:31.040]   in your mind?
[03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:35.000]   - In my career or in my life?
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.760]   - In your life, in your career and everything, your mind.
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:40.160]   So have you ever been depressed?
[03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:43.400]   - For sure, yes.
[03:23:43.400 --> 03:23:46.600]   - How did you, like if you can remember moments,
[03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:48.800]   how did you overcome that?
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:53.480]   - Well, I will share two anecdotes.
[03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:54.960]   One, when I was,
[03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:01.160]   May 2012, so I was 16 and a half
[03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:07.160]   and I was living in a household situation
[03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:14.200]   where I thought nobody knew what was going on basically
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:18.800]   without sharing obviously extremely personal details,
[03:24:18.800 --> 03:24:20.440]   like what was going on except me.
[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:24.580]   And I confided in my grandmother.
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:30.120]   I was, imagine living in a house
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:32.080]   where you basically feel like a prisoner.
[03:24:32.080 --> 03:24:33.960]   You don't wanna interact with anybody in the house.
[03:24:33.960 --> 03:24:36.400]   You don't know how you're supposed to bring these things up.
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:38.520]   Of course, this sounds extremely vague
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:41.600]   and I just don't, I don't feel like exposing
[03:24:41.600 --> 03:24:43.900]   all of my entire family drama to the audience,
[03:24:43.900 --> 03:24:48.640]   but I lived this way for probably something like
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:52.120]   eight months, I don't know, something ridiculous.
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:53.920]   It was the junior year of high school.
[03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:56.000]   So I was supposed to take my SATs.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:58.200]   That was the year I was supposed to finish up
[03:24:58.200 --> 03:25:00.760]   my portfolio for college 'cause you only get really
[03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:02.560]   a few months of senior year to start applying.
[03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:05.400]   It was a nightmare, complete nightmare.
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:09.060]   And I don't know how I got through it.
[03:25:09.060 --> 03:25:12.080]   Time went by, I listened to sad music
[03:25:12.080 --> 03:25:14.000]   and tried to spend as little time at home as possible.
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.480]   I would pretend to fall asleep at my friend's houses
[03:25:16.480 --> 03:25:19.040]   so that my mom was like, "You coming for dinner?"
[03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:21.080]   And I would just pretend to be asleep.
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:22.640]   - So it was just a grind.
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:24.160]   - Yeah, yeah, it was a grind.
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:26.960]   I don't remember a whole lot from that period,
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:30.640]   just sort of finding what made me happy
[03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:33.080]   and trying to focus on it.
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:34.480]   And I was a teenager in the house.
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:35.460]   I wasn't gonna run away.
[03:25:35.460 --> 03:25:36.640]   I still had a roof over my head.
[03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:40.320]   So I'm not saying I had it better or worse than others.
[03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:42.320]   I just had it different.
[03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:45.580]   And actually recently, this is much more on my memory.
[03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:51.720]   I more or less tore up a very happy life
[03:25:52.580 --> 03:25:54.000]   my wife and I had.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:58.120]   And I've talked about this in bursts on stream,
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:25:59.920]   but essentially what happened was
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:06.480]   we had just been living in,
[03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:08.560]   it's actually funny that the way we got into this apartment
[03:26:08.560 --> 03:26:09.840]   was also very bad,
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:13.160]   but we were living in just a very nice little apartment,
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:14.680]   like high-rise apartment, safe.
[03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:16.000]   And the reason we moved into a high-rise
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.240]   was because we had lived in a house for two weeks
[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:19.920]   that got broken into.
[03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:21.800]   Not because of who I am,
[03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:25.200]   but because we suspect we had people moving in mattresses
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:28.000]   and they went, "Oh shit, these two people live here?
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:29.420]   "That's it?"
[03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:31.620]   And basically there was three apartments.
[03:26:31.620 --> 03:26:33.360]   My upstairs neighbor let in somebody
[03:26:33.360 --> 03:26:35.300]   that they didn't expect.
[03:26:35.300 --> 03:26:37.520]   And the guy cracked our door open with a crowbar.
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:39.080]   Thank God that was the first day.
[03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:40.840]   In two years, my wife went to work.
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:43.080]   Did they know?
[03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:43.960]   Did they not know?
[03:26:43.960 --> 03:26:45.020]   I don't know.
[03:26:45.020 --> 03:26:46.620]   Everything happens for a reason.
[03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:48.520]   - So nobody got hurt.
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:49.360]   - Hmm?
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:50.180]   - Nobody got hurt. - Nobody got hurt.
[03:26:50.180 --> 03:26:54.280]   - They stole some couple of important things,
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:56.080]   but nobody was hurt.
[03:26:56.080 --> 03:26:57.320]   And the cops did nothing.
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:01.200]   - So you moved into a high-rise.
[03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:02.040]   - We moved into a high-rise.
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:02.860]   - In New York?
[03:27:02.860 --> 03:27:03.700]   - Yeah, in New York.
[03:27:03.700 --> 03:27:06.060]   For safety and we're away from things
[03:27:06.060 --> 03:27:08.580]   and we have our own nice little nook.
[03:27:08.580 --> 03:27:10.540]   And somewhere some months into it,
[03:27:10.540 --> 03:27:14.880]   I started hearing noises from above our neighbors.
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:17.560]   And it started in the morning, 7 a.m.
[03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:19.460]   It started in the afternoon.
[03:27:19.460 --> 03:27:22.440]   And I picked up on it.
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:25.440]   And I expected it every day for weeks.
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:27.920]   Then it was driving me crazy.
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:29.440]   And I was like, okay, we're gonna go have
[03:27:29.440 --> 03:27:31.320]   a civil conversation with whosoever up there.
[03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:32.200]   Sounds like kids.
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:34.360]   So we go knock.
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:35.780]   Lady gas lit the shit out of us.
[03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:37.160]   I've never been gas lit that hard in my life.
[03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:38.480]   She went, "Noise, what noise?"
[03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:41.440]   It's probably our other neighbor, who's a boxer.
[03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:43.960]   I was like, "Lady, you have kids.
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:45.560]   "We can hear you through the vents.
[03:27:45.560 --> 03:27:47.640]   "You're talking to your kids."
[03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:48.960]   Went to the front desk of the building.
[03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:49.800]   They did nothing.
[03:27:49.800 --> 03:27:50.620]   Went to the leasing office.
[03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:51.460]   They did nothing.
[03:27:51.460 --> 03:27:53.520]   And basically over time, it just was driving me nuts.
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:56.240]   It was, back to the stubbornness thing,
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:27:59.240]   I decided we were leaving.
[03:27:59.240 --> 03:28:01.500]   We were going to live somewhere there was no noise.
[03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:02.960]   'Cause we can't beat these people.
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:05.100]   There's nothing we can do, right?
[03:28:05.100 --> 03:28:08.440]   And my wife, I dragged her around
[03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:09.520]   to a bunch of different viewings.
[03:28:09.520 --> 03:28:10.360]   I was dead set.
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:13.600]   I decided I was completely miserable.
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:17.200]   And we found a house to rent, a nice house.
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:18.600]   Family had just moved away.
[03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:21.920]   House, standalone house, not gonna have neighbors.
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:24.880]   But wife decided that, not wife decided,
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:26.640]   we decided that it's too big.
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:27.560]   It's too big for us.
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:28.400]   So we're gonna get a dog.
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:31.760]   We always wanted an animal, so we're gonna get a dog.
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:33.640]   So we get an absolute lunatic puppy
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:35.840]   who just doesn't let us sleep at all.
[03:28:35.840 --> 03:28:37.160]   This is on top of everything else,
[03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:39.160]   the mental health crisis that's going on.
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:41.480]   And the day we are moving to this house,
[03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:44.200]   I realized I fuck up.
[03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:47.340]   Like I realized that this whole thing was in my head
[03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:49.140]   and I don't wanna leave.
[03:28:49.140 --> 03:28:50.480]   I don't wanna leave.
[03:28:50.480 --> 03:28:52.560]   This could have all been avoided.
[03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:55.260]   And the guilt and resentment, I didn't wanna exist.
[03:28:55.260 --> 03:28:57.380]   Like it's not that I, it wasn't suicide,
[03:28:57.380 --> 03:28:59.360]   but you know the feeling of just,
[03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:02.520]   you want to just observe yourself from a distance.
[03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:04.120]   And I couldn't sleep.
[03:29:04.120 --> 03:29:05.760]   I thought my wife was gonna leave me.
[03:29:05.760 --> 03:29:07.900]   Like this is the way, and that's what anxiety does.
[03:29:07.900 --> 03:29:10.640]   It also takes everything you feel to an absolute dread.
[03:29:10.640 --> 03:29:15.640]   And that I experienced for a good chunk of two weeks.
[03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:17.760]   And then we kind of settled down
[03:29:17.760 --> 03:29:19.400]   and decided like we're gonna live.
[03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:20.240]   - Did you tell her about it?
[03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:21.920]   Like were you able to talk through it?
[03:29:21.920 --> 03:29:22.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:29:22.760 --> 03:29:25.160]   I, yeah.
[03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:27.200]   - Does she know the levels of madness
[03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:28.600]   that could be inside your mind?
[03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:29.520]   - I don't know if she'll ever know,
[03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:30.920]   but I tried to tell her that.
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:31.960]   And--
[03:29:31.960 --> 03:29:32.800]   - Give glimpses.
[03:29:32.800 --> 03:29:33.620]   - Yes.
[03:29:33.620 --> 03:29:34.840]   - I'm not sure you'll ever know.
[03:29:34.840 --> 03:29:36.360]   I kind of took point.
[03:29:36.360 --> 03:29:38.980]   - Yeah, I tried to, that's why I try to keep busy.
[03:29:38.980 --> 03:29:40.720]   But that was the darkest it got.
[03:29:40.720 --> 03:29:43.000]   And yet through all of that, I went on stream every day.
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.360]   I made YouTube videos every day.
[03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:46.640]   Like I understood that I had a job to do,
[03:29:46.640 --> 03:29:49.300]   and I did it, and I talked about it here and there.
[03:29:49.300 --> 03:29:51.340]   But that was the worst that ever got
[03:29:51.340 --> 03:29:56.340]   because I'm learning that the emotions I experience
[03:29:56.340 --> 03:30:01.960]   are guilt, remorse, and your brain just goes in circles,
[03:30:01.960 --> 03:30:04.360]   basically, about things that you've done or haven't done.
[03:30:04.360 --> 03:30:07.400]   - It's funny 'cause noise can do that also.
[03:30:07.400 --> 03:30:10.600]   So the noise was real, but it was building in your head.
[03:30:10.600 --> 03:30:11.440]   - Yeah.
[03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:13.960]   So--
[03:30:13.960 --> 03:30:17.320]   - I try to, I actually, it's kind of funny
[03:30:17.320 --> 03:30:18.840]   because I like to focus deeply.
[03:30:18.840 --> 03:30:21.160]   And I'll have like sources of noise.
[03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:23.320]   I've tried to teach myself over time.
[03:30:23.320 --> 03:30:25.880]   I'll go to like coffee shops and stuff to like,
[03:30:25.880 --> 03:30:27.940]   I like, I almost try to put myself
[03:30:27.940 --> 03:30:29.400]   next to annoying situations.
[03:30:29.400 --> 03:30:31.280]   So I get like trained.
[03:30:31.280 --> 03:30:33.200]   Really, maybe I should do that.
[03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:36.040]   But it's a certain point, at the same time,
[03:30:36.040 --> 03:30:38.080]   I've gotten to hang out with certain people,
[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:41.080]   especially in LA, they're like in the middle of nowhere,
[03:30:41.080 --> 03:30:42.360]   like in Malibu or something.
[03:30:42.360 --> 03:30:44.640]   And it's like that quiet.
[03:30:44.640 --> 03:30:46.920]   - Can you hear your ears ringing it's so quiet?
[03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:47.880]   - Basically. - Yeah.
[03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:50.520]   - And it's like, holy shit, this is a good way
[03:30:50.520 --> 03:30:52.840]   if you wanna write something or create something.
[03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:54.680]   This is like super quiet.
[03:30:54.680 --> 03:30:57.120]   - So my mom does, my mom's a science,
[03:30:57.120 --> 03:30:58.320]   journalist, science author.
[03:30:58.320 --> 03:31:00.520]   She just published her first book, actually,
[03:31:00.520 --> 03:31:03.120]   on poop, of all things, yeah.
[03:31:03.120 --> 03:31:05.720]   Fecal, the waste management.
[03:31:05.720 --> 03:31:07.720]   It's actually a very fascinating concept
[03:31:07.720 --> 03:31:09.200]   and look through history.
[03:31:09.200 --> 03:31:10.240]   And she would do that.
[03:31:10.240 --> 03:31:12.080]   She goes to complete solitude.
[03:31:12.080 --> 03:31:14.680]   - Yeah. - And she writes, yeah.
[03:31:14.680 --> 03:31:16.600]   - It's beautiful, no sirens.
[03:31:16.600 --> 03:31:17.920]   I mean, New York is the opposite of that.
[03:31:17.920 --> 03:31:22.920]   So you've brought it, you brought it on yourself.
[03:31:22.920 --> 03:31:26.240]   - I've lived there for 20 years.
[03:31:26.240 --> 03:31:29.480]   - Has it been tough going on stream
[03:31:29.480 --> 03:31:32.000]   to put on the face of happiness through that?
[03:31:32.000 --> 03:31:37.000]   - Yeah, yes, but I find my ways to have moments
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:39.520]   where I can talk about it.
[03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:42.720]   If it's on a stream, I don't get 10,000 live viewers,
[03:31:42.720 --> 03:31:44.280]   so it's very different.
[03:31:44.280 --> 03:31:47.920]   If I stream late night, I get 1,500, 2,000 viewers.
[03:31:47.920 --> 03:31:50.680]   I used to care a lot more about viewers on stream,
[03:31:50.680 --> 03:31:52.880]   but I've basically invested fully in YouTube,
[03:31:52.880 --> 03:31:54.800]   so that's kind of the way I--
[03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:56.920]   - And I think, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,
[03:31:56.920 --> 03:32:00.960]   but I think people appreciate the human being
[03:32:00.960 --> 03:32:04.040]   behind the chess streamer.
[03:32:04.040 --> 03:32:05.600]   - I think so, I think so.
[03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:08.600]   I think a lot of people, not in the chess world,
[03:32:08.600 --> 03:32:11.480]   but just a lot of people, they put on a persona,
[03:32:11.480 --> 03:32:13.400]   and just in general, social media's the highlights
[03:32:13.400 --> 03:32:15.320]   of your life, or the lowlights,
[03:32:15.320 --> 03:32:17.480]   just as long as they're dramatic.
[03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:21.040]   But I try to be very open and honest.
[03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:22.240]   When I'm tired, I'm tired.
[03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:24.860]   It's what makes my recaps of my tournaments,
[03:32:24.860 --> 03:32:26.480]   I think, so real.
[03:32:26.480 --> 03:32:27.880]   - Yeah, man, you're an incredible person.
[03:32:27.880 --> 03:32:29.280]   I've been a fan for a long time.
[03:32:29.280 --> 03:32:31.240]   It's kind of funny that we connected,
[03:32:31.240 --> 03:32:33.400]   and we got a chance to talk.
[03:32:33.400 --> 03:32:36.640]   Please, please keep creating, keep teaching people.
[03:32:36.640 --> 03:32:38.240]   - For now, I'm not going anywhere.
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:39.280]   (laughing)
[03:32:39.280 --> 03:32:44.280]   - Well, it could end at any moment, as we talked about.
[03:32:44.280 --> 03:32:46.840]   So yeah, thank you so much for talking today, man.
[03:32:46.840 --> 03:32:47.920]   Thank you for everything you do.
[03:32:47.920 --> 03:32:49.120]   It was an honor.
[03:32:49.120 --> 03:32:49.960]   - It was great.
[03:32:49.960 --> 03:32:51.640]   Thanks for having me on.
[03:32:51.640 --> 03:32:53.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:32:53.200 --> 03:32:54.360]   with Levi Rosman.

[03:33:00.480 --> 03:33:02.040]   from Irving Cherneff.
[03:33:02.040 --> 03:33:06.880]   Every chess master was once a beginner.
[03:33:06.880 --> 03:33:10.240]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:33:10.240 --> 03:33:12.840]   (upbeat music)
