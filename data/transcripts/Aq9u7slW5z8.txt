[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Bing Chat is an extraordinary tool that yes can make mistakes but which can also do amazing things
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.840]   and give you a real edge in whatever you want to do. This crash course will take us from complete
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.800]   beginners up to advanced users following 12 steps each of which is potentially more useful than the
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.840]   last. Step one starts by us going to bing.com and clicking chat. You'll see this screen with a chat
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.600]   input down below. If you don't see this and don't yet have access to the chatbot feature my tip is
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.760]   to follow the four instructions on the bing.com/new website which are to join the waitlist, set
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.120]   Microsoft defaults and install the bing app. You can easily undo these steps if you like once you're
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.880]   in and I gained access within about 48 hours. Alternatively to be honest bing chat access will
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.480]   be rolled out to everyone eventually. But before we can begin on what bing can do step two involves
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.820]   knowing the limits of bing. If you're a beginner you can start with bing chat and then you can
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.600]   start with bing chat. As of filming you have a 2000 character limit on inputs, a five message per
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.600]   conversation limit and a 50 message per 24 hour period cap. And one further interesting restriction
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.960]   to point out bing really doesn't like it if you try to talk to it about itself. It doesn't even
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.440]   like it if you ask it for its name. I've done a video on this. But now let's get to the good stuff.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.800]   Step three you can link to articles, pdfs, academic papers and even physical
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.500]   text and engage in a dialogue with bing about what's inside. This is truly revolutionary.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.780]   I linked to an article in today's new york times about how leonardo da vinci had thoughts about
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.260]   gravity even before newton and I simply asked eli5 explain it like i'm five. Of course bing
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.340]   understood that instruction but what's truly incredible is that it was able to read and
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.780]   digest an article from today, explain it in really simple language, try reading it yourself.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.900]   Just look at the details it picks out. I could rave about this for ages I've just got so much more to
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.740]   show you. But what did I mean by engaging with physical text? You can take a photo of anything,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.500]   for example this math problem. Send it to your desktop and then go to google image search. Drag
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.520]   the file onto the screen and this will happen. Click on text to extract the text. Grab the text,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.060]   in this case the question and you can guess what's coming next. Yes that's right go to bing and paste
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.760]   the question in. Now you can see that bing has a lot of information about the text. It's a lot of
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   information. I know the meme is that GPT powered models aren't good at math but as a math tutor I
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.280]   can say that's old news. I've done plenty of videos on this on my channel, check them out.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.880]   But AI is getting a lot better at math fast. It gets this question right with a nice explanation.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.960]   But imagine this for physical text that you want to explore in your environment.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.640]   Three steps from the camera to a conversation with a super advanced AI about it. Incredible.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.740]   But it's time for the next step, generating interesting ideas. This could be for youtube,
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.180]   instagram, tiktok, linkedin, whatever. To demonstrate I asked, generate five original
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.620]   youtube video ideas for a new consumer tech review channel. Detailing the novelty of each one,
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.380]   ensure the topics are trending in 2023 and write a detailed synopsis of each video with a hook,
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.540]   a challenge and a reveal. Feel free to steal any of these prompts by the way.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.020]   And you can read the answers for yourself but I think they're pretty interesting. Any one of
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.720]   these would make a viable video idea, in this case for youtube. Let's read the first one, make a video
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.820]   about the mac mini 2023, the ultimate desktop computer question mark. And the video idea is to
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.060]   test the performance, the design, the features, talk about the m2 chip and how to optimize the
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.820]   mac mini experience. It gives specific examples of the tech that you could compare and suggestions
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.980]   of how to make your video different, like testing them out in different scenarios such as in the gym
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.500]   or at home. What about twitter? It can do that amazingly too. I follow Tim Urban, always coming
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.700]   up with new interesting ideas and I said write five real interesting ideas for youtube. Write
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.000]   down your original tweets in the style of Tim Urban. And these tweets were incredible. You can
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.520]   read all of them but take the fourth one. There are more stars in the observable universe than
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.160]   grains of sand on all the beaches on earth. But there are also more atoms in a single grain of
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.680]   sand than stars in the observable universe. So which is bigger, the universe or a grain of sand?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.440]   I can imagine him asking that. But let's take this a step further by bringing in image generation.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.680]   I asked Bing, generate five incredibly descriptive visual mid-journey prompts on topic four.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.300]   It understood exactly what I meant and came up with these examples. I put them into mid-journey
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   and here's what came out. A grain of sand magnified to reveal a complex microcosm. I think the third
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.500]   result is best here. Or what about the universe as a tiny speck inside a giant eye that belongs
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.760]   to an unknown cosmic entity? Look at the second example. These would definitely be eye-catching
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.660]   in a social media post. Just quickly, here are some of the others. A surreal collage of different
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.800]   images of the earth and the sun. I picked out just a couple of these examples to upscale into a full
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.760]   image with even more detail. And here was one of the results. That is an AI image you can attach to
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   a tweet written by an AI. The world is getting really weird. Before we move on to the next step,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   let's not forget about the 80/20 principle. Yes, we might let Bing AI do 80% of the work,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.640]   but you still have to fact check and make these posts, these ideas,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.620]   even these image generations your own. I wouldn't recommend letting Bing do all the work. And I would
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.740]   definitely check its outputs. It does make mistakes. Next, what about using Bing search to actually,
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.020]   you know, search? Imagine you're looking to move home and look at the kind of search you can do
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.020]   with Bing AI. Compare property price trends, commute to King's Cross times, crime rates,
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.220]   median ages, and green spaces in the two London boroughs of Haringey versus Barnet. And here are
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.620]   the details.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.040]   And of course, I could continue this conversation by asking more about green spaces, median age,
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:09.000]   etc. Compare this result to Google. Now, I still do use Google and will continue to. But honestly,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.420]   these results are just not too useful. I would have to click on multiple links to even have a
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.560]   hope of coming up with some of the answers that I've already gotten. Let me give you two more
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.600]   examples to balance it out. I asked Bing list five electric car charging points nearest to Big Ben in
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.240]   London. And it gave me five charging points. And these do check out. They are near Big Ben,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.440]   and they are suitable. But they are all from Q Park. And Google gave me more varied results. So
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   I count that as a win for Google. Another win for Google came when I asked, where can I buy flowers
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.780]   nearest to the second option? It understood what I wanted, but gave me some online options. Even
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.580]   when I was more specific and said I need a physical store florist within 15 minutes walk, it gave me some
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.100]   pretty poor results. Google did much better. How about doing a search for shopping? Well,
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.740]   I asked for the best battery cases for the iPhone 14. And it gave me some good options. And then I
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.620]   was more specific. I want the biggest battery capacity and it must be under 30 pounds. These
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.660]   were some decent results, but I would have hoped for direct links for purchasing these cases.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.320]   Remember, every click counts in the war between Google and Bing.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.560]   Even when I said compare these two cases for me, which is what Bing suggests,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.700]   I said, it did give me this nice table, but again, no direct links. And one extra slight warning. It
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:39.000]   suggested a case that isn't actually available in the UK, despite me making it fairly clear that I
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.360]   was from the UK by asking for the price in pounds. And of course, my IP being in the UK. So in terms
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.740]   of search, the wind still goes to Google, but Bing chat does have its use cases.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.540]   The next step to being an advanced user is to use Bing AI to improve your writing. A
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.800]   student of mine wrote this as their introductory paragraph for their personal statement,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.140]   a bit like a cover letter for a university. It's not bad, no spelling mistakes, but the writing is
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.440]   kind of bland. And look what Bing was able to suggest. These are nuanced comments, a step
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.960]   change from ChatGPT. If you want to learn more, by the way, about how Bing AI is smarter than
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.240]   ChatGPT, I've done two videos on this topic on my channel. Let's look at a couple of the suggestions.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.520]   It says the introduction is too long and verbose.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.380]   It could be shortened by removing unnecessary details and using more concise language.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.700]   For example, instead of saying, I have always been an observant and enthusiastic individual,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.480]   always looking for answers to how and why things work in a particular way,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.400]   which is what my student wrote. You could say, I have always been curious and eager to learn how
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.520]   things work. Much shorter, a great suggestion. Bing goes further and actually rewrites the
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.420]   introduction. I have read this, you can too, and it is a significant improvement.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.500]   I mean, you could improve it still further, but that
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.080]   would take real writing skill to do. But notice it didn't just spit out the output. It gave reasons
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.160]   for each of its suggestions. And that's vital if you want to learn and improve.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.400]   Next step is Bing's ability to tell jokes and do creative writing. This is kind of a hit and
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.380]   miss affair. It's quite hard to get Bing to do what you want, but when it does, it works really
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:22.560]   well. Notice what I tried. I said, write five actually funny original jokes, and it found
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.480]   jokes from the web. Now, I think some of these are quite funny. For example,
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.660]   what do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese. But these aren't original. It stole these.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:37.780]   So I said, write five jokes about Twitter. And the first one's decent. Again, these aren't Bing jokes,
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.100]   though. They're stolen. First joke is, a man tells his doctor, Doc, help me. I'm addicted to Twitter.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.160]   The doctor replies, sorry, I don't follow you. Not bad. Three of the jokes, by the way, aren't even
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.200]   about Twitter. Not sure what's going on there. But then when I asked it to do a comedy skit, I
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.460]   initially faced some problems. I was told that I was going to be a doctor. I was told that I was going
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.520]   to be a doctor. I was told that I was going to be a doctor. I was told that I was going to be a doctor.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.880]   The first two times I asked, it simply refused. It said that topic is too sensitive and
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.000]   controversial for me to joke about. It was going to be about TikTok, Donald Trump, Elon Musk.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.620]   I tried again, removing the brand name of TikTok, and just said social media, and again it refused.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.500]   However, I tried one more time and made it fully generic, and it picked up on what I actually
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.620]   wanted and wrote something great. I asked, somewhat generically, write a funny and creative
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.280]   story about a billionaire buying a big social media company and using it to promote his posts.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.160]   This time it complied. And you can read it for yourself, but I think it's quite entertaining.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.580]   Elon Musk was bored. He had already conquered space, electric cars, tunnels, and brain chips.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.780]   He wanted a new challenge. He wanted to own Twitter. It goes on and on, and then finally
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.920]   ends with, Twitter became Elon Musk's playground, and nightmare, and empire. The end. So it can do
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.500]   creative writing if you prod it in the right way. In the next step, more advanced now, you can use
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.420]   it as a kind of free consultant. A swap.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:01.060]   Your analysis assesses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a given business.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.600]   And Bing was able to do this for a startup I chose almost at random, Hugging Face.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.500]   It's answers are detailed and interesting. Imagine this applied to your business. And
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.740]   of course you can continue the conversation or follow the links to find out more.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.780]   Next, it could help on a more granular level. You can use it to respond to reviews.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:25.400]   This is a real review, two stars, posted about the Peninsula Hotel in Paris. I'm going to
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.380]   let you compare the response that Bing provides with the actual response that the Peninsula
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.960]   Hotel Paris wrote on TripAdvisor. Essentially this person was complaining about lots of
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   things, mentioning some positives, but complaining about quite a few things as well. And my prompt
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:47.260]   was, write a polite, professional, and detailed response to this review. I think this response
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.260]   is incredible. It goes into detail, addressing each of the points. And this was a mind blown
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.380]   moment. It actually uses a real email. I checked this.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:02.440]   I'm going to read this and compare it to the official response.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.220]   I mean the response is professional and it is polite, but it's far less detailed. There
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.160]   are some grammar issues and it doesn't address all of the points. If you could have a professional
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.080]   response ready instantaneously for any of your customer reviews, wouldn't that help
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.140]   your business? Next, you can use Bing AI to get into, or to
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.360]   get better at, coding. I'm a beginner at coding, but it was able to help me get better at coding.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.660]   I think it's a great way to get better fast. Take this simple request. I've experimented
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.120]   with probably a hundred pieces of code, but I just wanted to give you a simple example.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.340]   I asked, write Python code that will add 5% to a user's number and then divide by three.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.460]   This is a simple math request that you can imagine being used for a restaurant, for example.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.940]   If you're new to code, you can always try this out in an application like VS Code, or
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:55.340]   just run the code online as a fun experiment. I pasted it into online-ide.com, for example,
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.960]   which has quite a few coding languages to choose from, and then you press run. It will
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:06.380]   prompt you for a number. I entered a number and it gave me the correct result. Only your
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.360]   imagination can limit you in terms of what you can try out with coding, even for complete
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.840]   beginners, now that you have Bing and ChatGPT.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.980]   Next step, you could use Bing Chat as a quick and easy review aggregator. Only if things
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.320]   you don't care too much about, for example, like TV shows, movies, restaurants maybe, anything particularly
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.940]   important, you want to check the reviews yourself. But here's what it came up with
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.520]   when I asked it for IMDB Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic Empire and Guardian reviews of The Last of
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.220]   Us in detail.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.320]   Some of these numbers are a little off because I think it got confused with the game. And
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.260]   even when I clarified, it didn't give the most comprehensive result imaginable. But
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:50.240]   for quick and easy review aggregation, I think it might get really handy. Same for testing
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.300]   out any worries you might have about a restaurant or hotel. For example, I asked, are there
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.800]   any negatives for staying at the Peninsula Hotel Paris? I feel like I'm picking on that
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.180]   hotel. It is one of the best hotels in the world apparently. I'm definitely not trying
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:08.100]   to pick on it. But Bing was able to find some negatives that reviewers have pointed out.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.620]   This saved the time of me scrolling through the reviews to find out what might be a slight
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.580]   issue. Skip straight to the positives and the negatives.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.680]   Next step, simply using it as a tutor. And I say this as a tutor.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.280]   But I certainly couldn't find you five peer reviewed studies on the link between career
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:31.300]   team consumption and cognitive performance, nor could I summarize the findings instantaneously.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.400]   Here are the results. And of course, I could continue this conversation and ask about the
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.080]   molecules inside creatine, the sources of it, the cost of it, other reasons for taking
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.800]   it, reasons not to take it.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.820]   Or let's say you don't care about creatine and you want to know about large language
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:53.180]   models, the models behind Bing AI and ChatGPT. You can use Bing to teach you. It can't quite
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.260]   explain advanced math and English.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:01.300]   But it's free and can give you a great start on a topic. It's also never grouchy and doesn't
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.020]   need any coffee. So that's another plus.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:09.580]   Finally a bonus step. You can use it to improve your own health. I said, write me a high protein
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:14.860]   vegetarian meal plan for a week and give me five tips on how to actually stick to it.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:20.440]   The tips were decent. So I followed up by saying, give me this as a daily meal plan.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:25.240]   Include protein shakes. It gave me a one day meal plan and even told me how to do it. I
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.060]   thought that was a great idea. But it was not. So I decided to do a few simple exercises.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:34.460]   Think of it more as a source of inspiration rather than a final authority on any matter.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.060]   If you think of it like that, Bing's utility is almost endless.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:43.720]   If you want to find out more about just how smart the new Bing is, check out my Bing chat
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.120]   playlist. I detail Bing's current IQ. It's sometimes surprising conversations.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.220]   If you check out my GPT-4 playlist, you can find out about 8 upgrades that may be coming to
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:00.820]   Bing AI in the near future. If you found these steps at all useful, please do let me know
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:06.100]   in the comments. It really motivates me to make more such videos. Have a wonderful day.
