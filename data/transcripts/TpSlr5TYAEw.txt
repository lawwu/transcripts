[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   With that, let's get into it.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.920]   Jesse, what is our first query of this week's episode?
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.680]   - Okay, first question's from Rex.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.520]   He's a director of career office
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.800]   at a New England university.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.160]   I'm the director of a career office
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.920]   for an engineering students at an R1 university.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400]   Any suggestions on who we might structure a course
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.580]   about lifestyle-centric career planning for our students?
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.840]   - Well, a well-timed question,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.240]   because our deep dive was all about
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.200]   values-based lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.600]   emerging as potentially a dominant paradigm
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.480]   for how we think about meaning and work.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.040]   So Rex, the short answer is,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.200]   yes, I have good tips for designing a course on this.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.960]   Jesse and I's consulting fee is $250,000,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.680]   but we will be happy to spend,
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.640]   that gets you 45 minutes of our time.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.120]   Now, we do this in a group call,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.680]   so we might be consulting for a few people at the same time,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   but we'll give you some advice, Jesse and I,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.120]   so it's $250,000, and there we go.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.360]   All right, next question.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.220]   - A TDL Roan shirt.
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.480]   - And a, yes, and a Roan shirt.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.720]   We need $250,000 and a Roan shirt.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.080]   No, okay, I have some thoughts here.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.920]   Thoughts is the right word.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.080]   I was jotting down some notes before the episode
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.000]   about what I might put into a lesson plan
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.560]   for lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.400]   So I'm calling this thoughts,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.220]   'cause this is not worked through.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.760]   I just thought it would be fun to be concrete
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.880]   for the sake of being concrete.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.520]   So let's just experiment here.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.680]   Okay, so what might I do if I was teaching
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.440]   a bunch of college kids how to think about their career?
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.240]   I would start by saying, let's form a vision.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.120]   This is classic lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.640]   Let's form a vision of your life,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.380]   maybe at the age of 25, and again, at the age of 35.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.400]   We want a fully featured vision
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.720]   about all aspects of your life, not just your job,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.040]   but all aspects of your life,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.400]   five years from now, and maybe 10 or 15 years from now.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.520]   To help structure this vision,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.780]   you might wanna use something like the deep life buckets,
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.440]   where we have craft, community,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.820]   contemplation, constitution,
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.520]   maybe sometimes, what am I missing here?
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.360]   Sometimes we do celebration.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.540]   You know, we talk about this a lot on the show,
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.000]   but you might wanna use something like that, the structure.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.680]   Well, what are all the different aspects of my life
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.640]   that I wanna be included in this vision?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160]   It's okay if this vision evolves.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's not set in stone,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.360]   just what's resonating with you right now
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.320]   when you imagine what your life would be like.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.360]   All right, now we need to get from this vision.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.160]   Here's where we get to my new arbitrary lesson plan.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.600]   We have to get from this vision to you choosing a job.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.120]   Maybe you're a senior, you have to start job hunting.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.060]   How do you choose a job?
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.680]   Maybe you're farther along in your career,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   but wanna make a change.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.260]   How do you choose a job?
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.640]   How do we get brass tacks from something so broad?
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.240]   Well, I'm gonna give you three,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.080]   what should I call these?
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.120]   Three properties, three properties of a job.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.960]   Income, how much income it generates, location.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.800]   So you're thinking about where you're living,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.720]   and work type, which can include both the content,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.160]   like the specifics of what you're doing,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.720]   but also the parameter under which you're doing this work.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.780]   So flexibility, number of hours you're actually working.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.300]   So for each of these three properties,
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.660]   income, location, and work type,
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.340]   you wanna answer what would I need
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.140]   for each of these three properties in my job
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.380]   to support this big vision I had?
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.720]   So I have this big vision, how much money am I gonna need?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.060]   Where do I need to live?
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.320]   What type and how much work would I be doing?
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.000]   So you answer those three questions.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.180]   Now you have the specificity you need
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.580]   to go search for a job,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.620]   because now you're thinking about,
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.360]   okay, now I need to find a job
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.660]   that is going to get me those three properties,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.660]   or perhaps more realistically,
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.660]   if you're just coming out of school,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.580]   will get me to those three properties
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.060]   if over the first five years or 10 years,
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.140]   I get after it, become so good,
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.980]   I can't be ignored, build up career capital.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.140]   The answer to those three questions I'm gonna propose
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.900]   is the bridge from a broad vision
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.700]   to a specific choice of job.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.080]   So let me give an example.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.360]   I was working on my slow productivity book this morning,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.540]   as I do every morning, six days a week, I work on my book.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.200]   But today I was working on a chapter
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.460]   and I was talking about in that chapter,
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.120]   the entrepreneur Paul Jarvis.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.920]   So I went on a Paul Jarvis deep dive,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.720]   a sort of rabbit hole this morning,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.560]   so he's fresh on my mind.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.480]   So if you don't know Paul Jarvis,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.120]   he wrote a book in 2019 that I blurbed
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.000]   that was called "Company of One",
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.080]   which I really enjoyed.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.480]   It was about how if you're an entrepreneur or freelancer
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.880]   and you start to get good, don't scale your business,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.720]   instead leverage that increased ability
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.960]   to gain more flexibility and freedom in your business.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.260]   So if you're making $50 an hour as the web designer,
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.440]   and you start to get really good,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.760]   and there's a lot of demand for your work,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.080]   don't scale up a web design business
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.720]   where you hire four more designers
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.480]   to try to get your income to really go up even farther.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.980]   Instead, double your rate and work half the hours.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.800]   That's the idea of "Company of One".
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.400]   Keep it small, invest your skill to get more flexibility.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.880]   Anyways, because I happen to know a lot about this guy today,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.960]   let's answer those three questions.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.320]   The income I need, the location I want to be,
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.680]   and the work type I need.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.320]   Let's answer those questions for him
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.620]   and then talk about how he found a job that accomplished him.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.360]   So based on the various interviews I read,
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.200]   he had a vision of his life that was going to be,
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.400]   he wanted to get out of the rat race,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.800]   to get out of the city,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   to get away from stress, deadlines, stressed out clients.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760]   He was tired of all of that.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.840]   Him and his wife wanted to be somewhere quiet.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.280]   They wanted to spend a lot of time outdoors.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.640]   This was the vision they had built.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.880]   And he wanted a lot of autonomy in his time.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.440]   His wife was really into surfing,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.880]   so she wanted to be able to just go surf.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.800]   He wanted to be able to go for long walks and tend a garden.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.080]   And so they had this vision.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.920]   So it's a vision of life where
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.960]   work wasn't at the center of it.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.280]   At the same time, he's a creative.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.600]   So he was a web designer and he liked creative work.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.920]   He's a creative guy.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.120]   You know, he has tattoos on his arm,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.840]   so that means you're creative, right?
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.560]   So he wanted some sort of creative,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.900]   interesting work going on in his life,
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.280]   but he also wanted quiet, away from the rat race,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   away from deadlines, stressful client communication,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.000]   having lots of time and autonomy.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So they built this vision, they could see it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.840]   So how might he have answered those three questions?
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.320]   Well, for income, it didn't need to be anything special.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.560]   Average middle-class salary would be enough
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   'cause they don't need to live somewhere expensive
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.080]   for them to live this vision.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.360]   Because again, it's built on free time and nature,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.120]   not on trips to Europe or living on the ocean.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.080]   Location, they wanted somewhere quiet.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   They wanted nature, but they realized
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.200]   it couldn't be the extreme boondocks,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.120]   because again, he has tattoos on his arm.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.160]   So he needs to be near a coffee shop
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.720]   and so they can get organic groceries,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.120]   like have internet, like be near civilization,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.800]   but a quiet place and in nature.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.000]   So they had to answer that question.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.320]   And in terms of work type,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.760]   well, he wanted the work to be creative,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.080]   but to be free of, and he's very specific about this
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.180]   in the interviews I found, deadlines and demanding clients.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.480]   So he answered those three things and said,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   "Great, now how do I leave what I'm doing now
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.120]   "as a freelancer living in what he called
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.640]   "a glass cube in the sky in the downtown core of Vancouver
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   "and find a job that'll support these three visions?"
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.520]   What they ended up doing is they moved to,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.040]   here's how they answered, found a specific job.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.480]   They moved to Tolfino.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.960]   So the Pacific coast of the large rural Vancouver Island,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.640]   this big island off the West Coast of British Columbia.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.800]   Tolfino's about halfway up the island on the Pacific coast,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.880]   has really good surf breaks.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.240]   Best surfing in Canada.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.800]   That's a phrase that shouldn't impress you that much.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.020]   The best surfing in Canada is maybe not that good,
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.660]   but there's a good surf break here.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.480]   So his wife likes to surf,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.800]   but it's also so far off the beaten path, as he explained,
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.940]   you could buy some land
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.280]   without having to spend that much money.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   So they bought some land in the woods outside of this town.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.240]   As he said, it's cheap enough that I could afford it
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.520]   without having a lot of money,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.840]   but close enough to civilization
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.760]   that I could still have organic groceries
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.680]   delivered once a week.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.660]   So they sort of found that sweet spot.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.680]   So they moved there.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   He continued to do freelance web design for a while,
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.440]   but he just reduced his number of clients at first.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.360]   All right, so that was step one.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.400]   That's creative work.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.640]   It still had deadlines.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.780]   It still had client demands,
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.260]   but he could do it from Tolfino.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.400]   He could do it in the woods.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.320]   His wife became a surf instructor at the surf school there.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.960]   He built a greenhouse,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.500]   began this long running war with the local raccoons
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.200]   who kept trying to destroy his garden.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.720]   So he sort of had that going on.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.480]   And so that was the first step.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.640]   And then for the second step,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.260]   once they were established, they're living cheaply.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.440]   They didn't really need to make that much money.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.040]   He eventually switched from web design contracts
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.160]   to he began doing some online courses
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.000]   for very niche audiences.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.520]   Very niche online courses, did some podcasts,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.560]   and then also more recently has done various,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.500]   like again, very bespoke software products
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.840]   that is relevant to like a small group of people
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.980]   and that he could just put together and sell.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.200]   That freedom from deadlines,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.860]   that freedom from having to answer the clients.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.700]   And it just needs to make enough money
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.500]   to keep this lifestyle going.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.020]   And so there they go.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.860]   That vision led to those three answers,
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.760]   those three properties,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.900]   which led to this particular choice of career,
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.060]   which is let me continue the freelance,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.860]   but with a reduced client roster
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.980]   en route to doing online creative projects
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.020]   that I can support myself and I have to deal with clients.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.400]   And so during those first few years
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.640]   of doing more client work in Tolfino,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.780]   he built up a mailing list, he wrote this book.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.240]   So he had sort of enough of an audience
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.720]   that he could then sell a course.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.500]   But the point is,
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.560]   it's a very specific thing he ended up doing.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.440]   And you don't get to that decision
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.400]   by saying, what's my passion,
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.440]   by saying, what do I wanna do with my degree?
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.460]   You get there by starting with a vision,
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.300]   making it more concrete with answers
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.660]   to those three questions, income, location, and work type.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.740]   And then saying, given what I know how to do,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.100]   my opportunities, my skills,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.860]   whatever's on the table right now,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.780]   what do I have available to get towards those three answers?
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.260]   So I'll use that as a case study.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.380]   There is my lesson plan.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.820]   Rex, you can send the check for $250,000
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.820]   and our Roan shirts right to the HQ.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.820]   - So a course could just be like a lot of analysis
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.860]   of case studies and they could develop one for themselves.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.300]   - Yeah, like the court, he was doing,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.140]   like he did a course on-
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.740]   - I'm talking about for the students.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.720]   - Oh, for the students, yeah.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.680]   Yeah, you could do this, right?
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.580]   I mean, you could just walk through.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.560]   - A bunch and then-
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.400]   - Do the vision.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   - Develop your own.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.280]   - Yeah.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.320]   I mean, you could have like a vault
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.080]   of like, here's 20 examples.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.680]   So you can prime the pump.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.260]   And then yeah, you do the vision,
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.780]   answer those questions,
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.320]   start working through particular jobs.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.020]   Yeah, you could see this thing.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.760]   You could structure this course.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.640]   They should do this.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.100]   You know, the two things I'm so surprised
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.720]   about they don't do at colleges is one is,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.500]   don't just give every student who comes in
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.800]   like a copy of "How to Become a Straight A Student."
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.400]   So first of all, your job is to be a student.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.560]   I'm just gonna guess you're terrible at studying.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.820]   It's not that hard to become good at studying.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.600]   Like you should think about how to become good at studying.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.520]   We just give everyone that book.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.800]   And then the second thing is giving people
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   some sort of framework for thinking through
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.840]   what I wanna do with my life.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.120]   And so then people, I don't know, people don't know.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.280]   I mean, this was my,
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.600]   I think I get too reflective here.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.300]   I remember being really surprised about this at Dartmouth,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.280]   where I went to Dartmouth.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.840]   And I had come to Dartmouth sort of haphazardly,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.120]   just out of public school in New Jersey,
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.840]   like the schools in the mountains.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.400]   I don't know, it sounds cool.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.280]   You know, I didn't know a lot about Ivy League schools
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.640]   and whatever.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.720]   And so I just sort of assumed all of these people
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.440]   I know at Dartmouth are gonna like go off
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.720]   and become professors and writers
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.520]   and journalists and start cool companies
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.900]   and just like do really interesting stuff.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.360]   Because like these are all really interesting people
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.200]   it's hard to get in these schools.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.080]   I just remember being so surprised by how many of my friends,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.720]   I really think it was 50%.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.160]   I don't have the exact numbers,
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.680]   but I really think 50% plus of my friends at Dartmouth
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.400]   went to Harvard Law School.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.240]   - Yeah.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.000]   - And what I didn't realize was they came from,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.540]   their parents had professional jobs.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.800]   The point of going to a school like this
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.160]   from their perspective is that it gets you in to the track
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.520]   to have these well-paying professional jobs.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.120]   And it was just like the Manchurian candidate switch.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.080]   At some point I was like, okay,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.560]   we have to start our LSAT studying group.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   I just remember being so surprised by that.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.040]   But the schools don't give you any structure for this.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.840]   You know, at least Georgetown's good about it,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.040]   it has that Jesuit background.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.200]   There's a sense of improving the world.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.580]   Like that, there's a thread of that
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.960]   because it's a Jesuit university,
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.200]   but most schools don't have that.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.600]   And I think in the absence of any sort
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.320]   of systematic structure for thinking through your life,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.820]   your work, your application, your skills,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.560]   if you have a bunch of smart kids,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.480]   they're gonna go to Wall Street consulting or law firms
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.520]   because it's elite, it's hard to do,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.960]   and all things being equal,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.880]   they wanna do things that are competitive
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.040]   because otherwise they feel like.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.620]   (upbeat music)
