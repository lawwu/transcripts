[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hello and welcome back, and thank you for making the podcast a part of your week.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We started this week on Monday looking at flashy
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   pastors who flaunt their wealth. What should we make of them?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   There, Pastor John briefly mentioned a text in 2 Corinthians
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   where Paul says that we are not like so many peddlers
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   of God's Word. That's verse 17. It's a
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   memorable phrase, but that whole section is valuable for anyone
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   called to ministry. It offers up 5 tests to help you discern whether
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   you have been called to be a minister of the Gospel. It's a
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   very high calling. It's high because ministers are,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Paul says, "the aroma of Christ to God
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to one a fragrance from death to death, to
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   the other a fragrance from life to life." That's 2 Corinthians 2
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   verses 15 and 16. Gospel ministry
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   is not about becoming a creator. Gospel ministry
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   is not about making content. Gospel ministry
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   is telling sinners, "Come with me and live
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   or turn away and die." The
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   stakes are that high. Here's Pastor John to paint an especially
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   sobering picture of what the ministry represents.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   If you knew that tomorrow you were going
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   to go to Nicolet Mall and walk down
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   among all those people, and as you walked
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   some would get behind you and walk with you and be saved
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and everybody else would drop dead. Everybody.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Would that feel heavy?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Would you want to go there? Wouldn't you be tempted
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   to say, "I don't think I can do that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Who is sufficient for these things? I'm going to be a divider of the human race
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   in India. Who
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   can bear this?" That's the question that he asks
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   in verse 16 at the end. Who is sufficient
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   for these things? Now in
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   one sense, of course, the answer is nobody.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   But that's not Paul's answer here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   He said in chapter 1 verse 12 that by the grace of God he had this ministry.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He said that also in Romans 1 verse 5. And here
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   in chapter 3 verse 5, just drop down six verses to chapter 3
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   verse 5, and you see our sufficiency,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   this is at the end of verse 5, our sufficiency is from
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   God. So no, nobody is sufficient
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   in themselves. There are no sufficient missionaries, no sufficient pastors,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   no sufficient anybody who's following Jesus. We all lean
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   like cripples on God.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So I think one of the most crucial questions now that you can
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   ask yourself as we come toward the end of this service
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   is whether you can do this.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Can I do this? Can I
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   bear the weight of being the aroma
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   from life to life? Yes, that would be glorious. And death
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to death, that would be almost unbearable.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So can you do it? And the answer, I believe, is
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   given in whether you deal with verse 17 a certain
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   way. Paul gives here
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   five tests to help
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   you know whether you can do this.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I'm going to take these five tests and turn them into
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   questions and close with those
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   five questions. So these are five questions
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   for everyone, and how you
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   answer them, I think, will encourage you that
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   by God's grace you can do this.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Number one, do you treasure Christ
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   enough so that you don't peddle
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   His Word? For we are
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   not, like so many, peddlers
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   of God's Word. We don't sell
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   the Word of God. That means
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   we love Christ more than we love money. We don't
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   love money and use Christ. We love Christ
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and can let money go. That's the first question.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Do you love Christ more than you
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   love money? Question number two.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Now here the next four questions come in four
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   phrases which strictly, grammatically
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   modify the word "speak." So
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   it's literally, "We speak from sincerity.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We speak from God. We speak
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   before God. We speak in Christ." That's the
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   four next questions. So let's take them one at a time, turn them into questions.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   One, or two, will you
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   speak from sincerity?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   That is, will you mean what you say?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Will you renounce all sham,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   all pretense, all need to look like what
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   you're not? Will you be real?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Question number three, will you
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   speak from God? Translated in the ESV,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   "commissioned by God." That's one meaning.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Will you speak from God? That is, will you take His Word and speak it, not
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   your own word? Will you take His authority and speak it, not your own
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   authority? Will you take His wisdom, power, and
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   live in it, not your own wisdom and power? Will you always
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   look away to His Word, power, wisdom?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Lean on Him. Be from Him.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Question number four, will you speak
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   as before God? Which I think
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   means, will you count Him to be your judge
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and no man? That is,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   will you fear no man and know that
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   God alone is the one to whom you give account? Will you play
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   to one audience and not worry
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   about what other people say? Will you not be deterred
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   by the criticism of other people, but only look away
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   to your Father and by His Word discern His approval
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   before God? Finally,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   will you speak in Christ?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That is, will you get your identity from being in Christ?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Will you get your assurance before God from being in Christ? I promise
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you, if you're wired like John Piper, every day you will go to bed
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   uncertain whether you lived your life the way you should. Every day.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Because I have so many options.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   A constant, selective neglect
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   of good things is what my life seems to be made up of.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Have I made good choices? How can I sleep
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   in Christ? Is my only hope for going to bed
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   with any peace at all. How else can you live
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   in Christ for your assurance, in Christ
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   for your hope, in Christ for your confidence, in Christ for your courage,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   everything flowing from the union with Christ?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   There are no perfect missionaries.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   The answer to these questions, I hope, in all of your hearts
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   was something like this. "Yes, in as much
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   as I know my own heart, that's my longing, that's my
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   commitment. There are folds and contours
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   of my heart where hidden things lie. I know. Cleanse me
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   from hidden faults, but in as much as I know my own heart, yes
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   to those questions. Help me to love you more than money.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Help me to be real and sincere. Help me to speak
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   your word. Help me to fear no man. Help me to get
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   all I need from being in Christ." Yes.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I hope this ministry pushes you back onto the sufficiency of Christ.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's a sobering word here. I pulled this clip from a sermon on missions delivered
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   on October 29th, 2006, titled "The Aroma of Christ
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Among the Nations." It's online on the site in both audio
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and video format. If you have a sermon clip to share with me,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   email me and give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the time stamp of where the clip
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   happens in the audio, and make a note of what stands out to you. Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's an email
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Well, as you can imagine, when one spouse gets saved
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and the other spouse does not, it leads to new tensions
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   inside of the home, and one of those tensions will be the topic on the table on Friday.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I am your host, Tony Rehnke, and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   to end the week on Friday. See you then.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   [Silence]
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   [Silence]
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
