[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.680]   the third verse of the Epistle of Jude, the Epistle of Jude in verse 3.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.360]   Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.520]   for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.720]   which was once delivered unto the saints.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.560]   I want to deal particularly with the second portion of this verse, and exhort you that
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:42.600]   ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.320]   Now I call attention to this statement in this verse in order that we may continue a
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.400]   theme that has been occupying our attention here now for several Sunday evenings, and
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.760]   it is a theme which is probably obvious to all of you.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.640]   The business of preaching always is to help people how to live, and the theme we have
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.040]   been considering is this whole problem of life in this modern world, and how we are
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.200]   to live it, and how we are to face the crises, the strains, the trials of which we are all
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400]   so conscious at this present time.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.720]   Now that is the business of Christianity, is to do just that.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.160]   It is the most practical thing in the world, and there is nothing which is such a travesty
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.440]   of the Christian faith as that idea of it, that it is something remote from life, and
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.080]   something which has no immediate practical relevance.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.760]   Indeed, I am concerned to show that there is nothing which is so relevant to life as
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.160]   it is this very night as the message of this book which we call the Bible.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   Now we have been looking at this whole modern situation.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.800]   People react to it in different ways.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.200]   There are some who refuse to consider it at all.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.160]   All they want is the so-called good time, and though the world is as it is tonight,
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.600]   they are not concerned.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   They just contract out of it.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.960]   They just want to have their pleasures, whatever they are.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.560]   They don't think, they think they are very clever, they just go off on their little round
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920]   on their own.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.560]   And we have seen how there have been people like that many times before in this world,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.280]   and how they inevitably suffer a rude awakening, and find themselves utterly bereft, lost,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.160]   and hopeless.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.960]   Then we looked at others who, not being as foolish as that, felt that something should
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.240]   be done about this.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.400]   But the way in which they attempt to deal with the situation is equally futile.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   They trust to their wisdom, their knowledge, their understanding.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.240]   Others trust to their might and their power, others trust to their money, their wealth.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:07.440]   We saw how that again leads to nothing but failure, final despair, and complete loss.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.560]   There is no hope in that direction.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.280]   And then we moved last Sunday night to this position, that the essence of the modern tragedy
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:27.400]   is really this, that mankind in its confusion, in its helplessness, and in its failure, will
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.640]   not consider, will not even look at, speaking generally, the message of this book.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.320]   Here is a book offering men the answer to his questions, the solution to his problems.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.200]   There is no question about that.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.600]   If only everybody in the world tonight were living as the Bible would have us live, most
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   of our problems, if not all, would entirely disappear.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.920]   There would be no wars, there would be no rumours of wars, there would be no preparation
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.200]   for wars, and all our social and moral problems would be dealt with.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.680]   Here is the answer.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.200]   And it is confronting the human race, as it has been throughout the centuries.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.240]   But this is the tragedy, I say, that the world of men will not look at it.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.120]   Now we considered the problem last Sunday night as it's revealed and dealt with in
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   the 36th chapter of the book of the prophet Jeremiah, where we saw that there are some
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.280]   people who just dismiss the book as a whole.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.040]   He cut it with a penknife and burned it.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.800]   There are many who are doing the same thing.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.240]   You do that by ignoring it, dismissing it altogether, having nothing to do with it.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.280]   And we saw some of the reasons which make men do that sort of thing.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.760]   We see that ultimately it's pride, of course, pride of intellect especially.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.860]   And we also saw that it's indicative of this depravity that is in men since he fell
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.860]   from God.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.520]   He doesn't like this book, because this book condemns him, condemns the things he
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.720]   likes and asks him to do things that he doesn't like.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.040]   And he's so depraved that he hates it.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.920]   But we saw how that again leads to nothing but some utter futility.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.280]   You can't get rid of the book.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.440]   It ever finds you out, it comes back to you.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   And there it is, men trying to get rid of it, cannot get rid of it.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.480]   That is, I say, the very essence of the tragedy.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.880]   Now I'm so concerned about this aspect of the matter that I come back to it from a different
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.520]   angle this evening.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.980]   You see, the whole message of Christianity is to say this, that the message enshrined
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.920]   in this book is the only hope for any individual in this world at this moment.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.440]   There is no hope for the whole universe apart from what we are told in this book.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.560]   Why is it, I ask again, that men and women refuse it, refuse to consider it and refuse
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.000]   to put it into practice?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.480]   Why is this message rejected?
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   Well now, I want to take up another reason why so many do that at this present time.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.520]   It is a reason with which I'm sure you're all quite familiar.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.280]   It is because it's such an old book.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.480]   There are many who won't even look at it because they say it's an old book, it's such an old
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.560]   book.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:38.360]   Everything that is in this book had been written before the end of the first century A.D.,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.040]   as long ago as that.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.480]   And therefore they say that they won't even look at it, they won't consider it, they put
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.560]   it out of court without even knowing what it's got to say.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.720]   And their argument is something like this, it's a two-fold argument.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.840]   They say that because of the great changes that have taken place in life, in men and
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.240]   in the world as a whole, that it is quite ridiculous to consider the message of this
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   book.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:17.480]   They say the changes have been so vast, so phenomenal in man himself, in the whole of
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.960]   his living, in the whole of life as we know it and as it has become organized.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.120]   Now they say that because of this tremendous change that has taken place in men and his
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.560]   circumstances and conditions, the two things seem to them to be quite obvious and inevitable.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:43.120]   The first is that man's problems today are entirely new.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   That's the first thesis, the first argument.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.320]   That the problems of men living in this world tonight are entirely different from what they
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.520]   were when this book was written, or the various books in this book were written.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.000]   They say the whole problem is new.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.720]   The world in a sense, they say, has never had to face what we are facing at this present
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.240]   time, the complexity of it all, how involved it's all become.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.680]   They say, can't you see it in the statute book in Westminster?
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.040]   As life becomes more involved, you need a greater number of acts of parliament, you
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.320]   need a greater number of organizations and institutions.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.600]   Just contrast life today with what it was a hundred years ago.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.320]   How simple it seems to be then by contrast with what it is now.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:33.120]   Well, when you go back almost two thousand years, obviously the thing is very much greater.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   So they say we are confronted by an entirely different set of problems and of circumstances.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   And the second deduction they draw is this, that the Bible and its teaching, because of
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   its antiquity and its date, is of necessity hopelessly out of date and behind the times.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.640]   Now, their argument is put like this.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.680]   In every realm and department of life, there is nothing more obvious than progress and
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   development.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.280]   I needn't worry with that, it's perfectly obvious.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.200]   Any student in this congregation, any graduate, knows this.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.720]   That whatever subject you're dealing with, it is of vital importance that you should
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.800]   get the latest edition of the textbook.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.520]   A textbook is almost out of date nowadays, even when it's printed.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.000]   There have been such movements and changes and developments since the man even wrote
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.960]   his script, that it's virtually out of date when it comes before the public.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.560]   Everything is advancing and developing, and you must have the last edition, the very latest,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.120]   in order for it to be of any value to you.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:46.880]   But here they say, you are recommending us to turn back to this old book, which knows
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.280]   nothing about all the advances and all the developments and all the additions.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.360]   They say, isn't it patently obvious that to go back to this is something which is quite
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.600]   ridiculous?
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.440]   It's like putting the clock of time back a number of centuries.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.280]   Isn't it virtually asking us to commit intellectual suicide?
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   They say the Bible may have been all right in its own times, in its own setting, as the
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.400]   textbooks were in their time and setting.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.080]   Newton made certain statements, and they were revolutionary in his time, but of course by
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.880]   now Einstein and others have had to correct him and so on.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.480]   All right, Newton was all right for his generation and for perhaps a couple of hundred years
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.760]   after that, but no longer.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.840]   And so with all, the Bible, they say, like all old books, was all right in its own period.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.360]   But surely it's got nothing to say to us at this present time.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.040]   It's outmoded, it's outdated.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.440]   Obviously, it's no criticism of the book, but it can't be of any help because of all
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.640]   the changes that have taken place.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.360]   Man is a different problem, and he needs the latest and the last bit of knowledge and information
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.760]   in order to enable him to deal with it.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.960]   Now that's the argument.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:09.600]   An argument, I say, which is very common, the commonest of all the arguments perhaps
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.360]   with regard to this book.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.440]   So now then, clearly we've got to deal with this, because I stand here tonight to recommend
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.280]   this message to you.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.680]   That's my commission.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.160]   I'm not here to say what I think about life.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.960]   I'm not here to address you on my opinion as to the political situation, nationally
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.120]   or internationally.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.680]   I'm not here to tell the statesmen what to do.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.240]   No, I'm here to commend this book, the message of this book.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.880]   Well how do I do so in the face of this criticism, this attitude towards the book, which, before
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:48.120]   reading its contents, puts it right out simply because of its age and its antiquity?
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.920]   Well now, my answer is something like this, that that attitude is one which displays a
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:03.520]   complete misunderstanding in every way and in every respect.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.520]   What do I mean?
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.600]   I mean this, that that first statement about the problems of men being different because
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   his world is so different is altogether and completely wrong.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:27.520]   The problems of mankind this evening are exactly and precisely what they've always been.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.800]   That is perhaps of all the fallacies the greatest.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.000]   There is nothing new under the sun.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.480]   Oh I know it appears in a different form and we are fooled by that.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.280]   We are interested in the dress, in the appearance, not in the thing itself.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.560]   But the thing itself is exactly the same.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.920]   Whether you dress up a man as an ancient Briton or as an Elizabethan or as a 17th century
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:02.960]   man or as a typical beau of the 18th century or as a modern man in the mid-20th century.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.880]   The style of clothing of course is very different and we look back at the old style and say
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.680]   how ridiculous, how monstrous it all looks and how different was life then.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.200]   Yes, but you know men wasn't different.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.760]   The problems have not changed at all.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.880]   Ah, but you say they hadn't got to contend with the bombs.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.520]   There were no bombs then, but my dear friend that makes no difference.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   What does a bomb do?
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:35.400]   Oh I know something about the bombs, but the question is what can that bomb do if they
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.560]   send it off?
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.120]   And you know the simple truth about the bomb is this.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:45.680]   All the bomb can do is to kill you.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   That's all.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   It can kill you.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.240]   Yes, but you know the ancients with their pikes could do exactly the same thing.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.980]   That was equally killing.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.460]   We get so excited about the bomb, this terrible thing, but there's no difference between what
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.120]   a bomb does and what a pike does, what a bow and arrow used to do, what a man can do with
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.080]   his fist or if he takes up some instrument and knocks another man on the head.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   It can do no more than that.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.920]   It just kills.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.760]   So the problem of this atomic age is not in any sense different from the problem that
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.080]   men have always confronted.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   Thunderstorms, earthquakes, pestilences, enemy attacking.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   It's always been that.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.480]   Life has always been insecure, but you see we say, ah, because of the scientific discoveries
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.720]   and because of these terrible inventions, as if there was something absolutely new.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.400]   There's nothing new at all.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   Nothing at all.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.520]   It's like a radio under the sun.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.280]   Man is as he's always been.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.880]   He's got to eat and drink.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.280]   He's got the same instincts in him as he's always had.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.560]   And life has always been against him.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.920]   And people have always been difficult.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.200]   And there have always been quarrels.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.040]   There have always been disappointments.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.720]   There have always been wars.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.640]   There is always something that's threatening us.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.440]   It's always been like that.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.120]   There is no difference whatsoever this evening.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.360]   Isn't that remarkable?
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.080]   Because we've thought, we've persuaded ourselves that our problems are absolutely new, and
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.960]   the ancients knew nothing about them.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.580]   You stop and think about it, and you'll find that our problems are as old as man himself
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.040]   ever since he fell away from God.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   But a second comment I would make is this one, that as we have already seen, all men's
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   increase in knowledge and all his development and all his advance in information doesn't
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.840]   help him at all to solve these fundamental problems.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.800]   Now I needn't stay with that because we've already dealt with it a fortnight ago.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.560]   But not the wise man, glory in his wisdom.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   Why?
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.320]   Well, because it doesn't help him to deal with these problems.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.440]   Some of the wisest men in the world tonight are the biggest failures.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.600]   Men of greatest knowledge, I mean, and greatest understanding.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.840]   You may be a great philosopher, that doesn't mean of necessity that you can live happily
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.720]   with your wife.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.840]   Read up the records of these great minds in the divorce courts.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   No, no.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.400]   All we talk about our advances in knowledge and understanding and information, they don't
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   help us.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.360]   Our knowledge, our strength, our wealth, and all our power, it doesn't help us.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.640]   Well, if it did help us, the world wouldn't be in the trouble it's in tonight.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.520]   You see, we talk on the one hand of all our wonderful advances, our superiority over everybody
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.720]   that's ever lived before.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.160]   Well, then I ask a simple question.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.280]   If we are so superior, why do we seem to be in a much greater mess than they've ever been
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   in the past?
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.560]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.480]   You see, all this talk about the advance, it doesn't help us.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.840]   It doesn't make any difference at all.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:20.080]   Indeed, there is a good case for saying that it is all this that is really producing the
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:27.600]   acuteness of our crisis tonight, that our knowledge has advanced at a much greater speed
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.800]   than our common sense and our understanding of how to live.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.520]   So there's a second answer.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.800]   But the third answer is the one I want to deal with most exhaustively this evening,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.900]   and it's this one.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.720]   The really serious thing about this modern attitude to the Bible is that it displays
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   a complete misunderstanding with regard to the true nature of the Bible and its teaching,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.200]   and therefore the relevance of the Bible's teaching to today and the problems of this
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200]   very night.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.680]   Now, this is the serious thing.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.280]   To dismiss the Bible because it's an old book in that way and for those reasons I say is
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.880]   just to say that such people have never understood the character of the Bible.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.920]   And they display an ignorance of the message of the Bible and the whole purpose and object
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.200]   of the Bible, and how the Bible really does help us to meet the problems that are confronting
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.560]   us at this very moment.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.160]   Now then, let me demonstrate this.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.480]   I want to do so in terms of this word here in this third verse of the general epistle
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.480]   of Jude.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.680]   Here it's put before us perfectly.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.280]   Let me summarize its teaching.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.880]   The first point he makes is this.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.720]   The nature of the Bible's message.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.560]   Now here is the first fallacy.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.200]   The nature of the Bible's message.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   What is it?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.160]   He sums it up in this word.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.440]   The faith.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.760]   It was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.440]   for the faith.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.640]   The faith.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.000]   Not faith in general, but the faith.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.480]   What does this mean?
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.500]   Now here I say is the first indication of the failure of the average modern man who
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.520]   dismisses the Bible today to understand the character and the nature of the Bible.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.520]   What's his view of the Bible?
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.560]   Well, most people seem to think the Bible is a strange sort of collection of odd parts
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   and bits and portions.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.920]   Go and ask such a man, "What's your view of the Bible?
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   What have you got in the Bible?"
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:32.080]   "Well," he says, "what you've got in the Bible, of course, is, well, you've got a bit of history.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.640]   There's a good deal of history of various nations, the Jews in particular, but it does
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.960]   tell us a bit about the Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Egyptians, and various other people.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.360]   There's a sort of hodgepodge of history here, and quite a good deal of it.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   And then it particularizes now again, now and again, on the history and the story of
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   particular individuals.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:57.000]   It takes up their story, tells us how they were born, how they fell in love and got married,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.480]   how some of them became kings, and then how they fought their battles and how they died.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.480]   Quite a lot of it.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   There's a great deal of history.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.040]   Both of nations and of individuals.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.160]   Very interesting, they say, but of course, no more relevant to us today than it is to
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.960]   read a novel.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.260]   Quite entertaining if you've got nothing better to do, but of no real significance or relevance
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.960]   to us in our present predicament.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.200]   Then they say, in addition to that, there is, of course, in the Bible, after all, something
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   that is of very great value.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.960]   There's a good deal of moral and of ethical teaching.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.640]   There are some wonderful moral maxims in the Bible.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.600]   Ten commandments, very interesting.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.080]   Book of Proverbs, a wise man sending a kind of letter to his son, as Lord Chesterfield
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:53.640]   did later, and various other people have done throughout the centuries, moral maxims.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.240]   Just telling us how to live, Sermon on the Mount.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.080]   Again a very noble list of ethical moral principles.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.640]   They say that's in the Bible, aren't they?
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.200]   And they are really very interesting.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   And then on top of that, there is this story of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.600]   And a picture and a portrayal of how he lived in this world, the same world as we are in,
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.400]   and there he stands before us as a very wonderful and a very striking example.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.360]   Of course, you get similar examples.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.480]   All the great men of the ages, the great sages, the great philosophers, the great moral teachers,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.080]   they all help us tremendously, and it's therefore a good thing to study their lives, read about
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.400]   the Buddha, read about Confucius, and so on.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.040]   And here is this story here of Jesus of Nazareth, and it gives us a wonderful moral ethical
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.720]   example, something to follow, something to live up to.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   Now they say, that's your Bible.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.680]   It's an art collection and gathering of these various things.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.140]   But you know that isn't what this man Jude tells us about it, this apostle.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.560]   It isn't what the Bible says about itself everywhere.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   That's an entirely false view of the Bible.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   What is the Bible?
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.480]   Well, the Bible is something that contains the faith.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   The faith.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.800]   What does this mean, says someone?
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.040]   Well, it means this.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:22.400]   That running through all the history and all the moral teaching and all that I've mentioned,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:29.800]   there is a truth, there is a doctrine, there is a teaching.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.580]   Running right through this book from beginning to end, there is one great message.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.940]   It starts at the very beginning and it goes on and on and on until you come right to the
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.940]   end.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.180]   A faith, a message, a teaching.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.180]   What is it?
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:52.100]   Well, it's the teaching about God's plan and God's purpose for this world.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.220]   Now, the Bible handles this one theme in an extraordinary manner.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.740]   There are times when you almost feel that it's forgotten it itself.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.420]   And you seem to be meandering off on some sideline and some tangent which doesn't seem
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.540]   to have the remotest connection with the theme.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.980]   But if you read carefully, you'll always find that it has.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.180]   There is only one great message in this book.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.820]   This is the marvel of the book.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.300]   It's 66 different books bound together, but there's only one theme from beginning to end.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.020]   It is God's plan for this world, God's purpose for this universe.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.300]   It starts and goes right through, illustrates itself in these myriad ways, but it's always
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.060]   following its main line.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:42.140]   Always saying the same fundamental thing, the faith.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.420]   Now I want to add to that by saying that this message is a perfectly clear one.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:53.860]   It isn't some vague, nebulous, indefinite, ill-defined statement.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.220]   It's a clear statement.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.620]   It's as clear as this, that it can be taught.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.860]   People can be instructed in it.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.640]   Christianity is not just a feeling which you get.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.880]   It's not just some idea which grips you.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.900]   It's not some vague movement within you.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.340]   No, no, it's a teaching.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.260]   It's a body of teaching and of doctrine.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.420]   It can be presented.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.540]   It can be taught.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.500]   It was taught.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.780]   Our Lord taught it, the disciples taught it, the apostles taught it, others have taught
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.780]   it ever since.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.580]   And in the Bible there are many summaries given us of this message, this teaching, this
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.700]   faith about which it speaks.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.380]   Did you notice that Jude says that it's as clear as this?
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:40.660]   "Exhort you," he says, "that you should earnestly contend for the faith."
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.060]   Well you can't contend for a thing unless you can define it.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.940]   He says, "You know, I was going to write you a letter about the common salvation, but
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.260]   unfortunately it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.820]   earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints."
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.260]   There are people who are attacking this.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.700]   Now he says, "I'm calling upon you to reply to them.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.900]   You've got to defend the faith.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.520]   You've got to contend for the faith.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.460]   You've got to show that they're wrong and that they've gone astray."
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.860]   And then he proceeds to tell us about them.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:15.220]   Well now I say you can only do that if you've got something that can be defined.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.220]   If to be a Christian is just to have a vague, nice feeling that you want to help people
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.180]   and that you want to do good and so on, well you can't say that something else is wrong.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.540]   You can't contend for that.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.180]   No, but this is the faith.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.780]   It is something that can be stated quite clearly in propositions.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.800]   A man can attack it and you can reply to him.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.260]   That is the meaning of all the creeds that have ever been used and are still used in
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.260]   the church.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.260]   These are all statements of this faith.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.580]   They are definitions of this faith.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.700]   It can be criticized.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   It can be defended.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:53.060]   Therefore, I say, it is something which is perfectly clear-cut, well-defined, and can
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.660]   be stated in a number of propositions.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.220]   Now then, that's the Bible's own claim for itself.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.540]   It isn't a hodgepodge of these different things.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.300]   There is one great fundamental message here.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.180]   This is the thing that is confronting mankind this evening.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:20.540]   This message that is in this book concerning the world, its present, its past, its future,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:26.140]   God, and his plan and his purpose with regard to the whole human race and with regard to
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.860]   the whole universe.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.460]   The faith.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.580]   Something distinct and plain and clear.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.940]   Very well, there is the first thing we've got to say.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:44.180]   Anybody who hasn't realized that is entirely ignorant of the nature of the Bible's message.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.820]   You don't know what the Bible's talking about.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.620]   You don't understand its message.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.460]   That is what the Bible says.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.460]   That is its message.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.940]   But come to the second point.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:58.620]   Look for a moment at the source and the origin of the Bible's message.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.220]   And here again people go astray.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.860]   It was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:15.300]   for the faith which was once delivered, delivered unto the saints.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.060]   Now this is the crucial word.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.380]   This word delivered, it means handed down, given to.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.420]   Somebody comes to your door, rings the bell, you go there, he says I'm here to deliver
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.900]   a parcel to you, and all you do is to receive it.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.500]   You do nothing but answer the bell when he rings it, and there he hands you the parcel.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.940]   He's delivering the parcel.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:41.100]   Now the message of this book is something which has been delivered to me, given, handed
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.100]   over.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.620]   Now this is, I say, absolutely crucial.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.540]   Let me put it negatively.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.700]   This book is not a collection of men's thoughts.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:57.860]   This isn't just a collection of men's ideas and men's theories with regard to life.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.900]   Now all other books are that, of course.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.180]   I'm not disparaging these other books.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.060]   There are many great books in the world.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.620]   There are many great books on philosophy and on art and on various subjects, books on ethics.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.620]   What are they?
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.620]   But they're men's thoughts.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.820]   Men have been thinking and reasoning.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.740]   That's what that great succession of Greek philosophers did.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.460]   They were men who just sat down and began to think and to think things right through.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.100]   They were trying to understand life.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.060]   It was put in books, in writing.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.820]   But it was nothing but the thoughts of men.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:31.780]   They were seeking and searching and trying to understand, and that's the result of their
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.420]   effort.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.140]   But that isn't the case here.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.740]   This is the faith that has been once delivered to the saints, given to them, handed over
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.020]   to them.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.380]   They haven't discovered anything.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.300]   They've just received something.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.740]   It's something that's handed on from man to man.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.660]   And it was originally given to those who first wrote it.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.660]   Well what does this mean?
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:59.780]   Well now, here is, to me, the great thing which we have to understand at the beginning.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:07.340]   The contents of this book, far from being the result of human discovery, are the result
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.020]   of the revelation of God.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:16.940]   It is what God has given, what God has revealed, what God has made known.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.180]   Now don't you see why I call you to listen to this book?
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.940]   Here we are in our terrible trouble and perplexity tonight, and men have written this and that,
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.980]   and men are speaking this and that, giving their ideas, and nothing comes of it.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.620]   In the name of God, I ask you, why don't you listen to this?
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.140]   This is what God says.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.500]   Revelation.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.180]   Something shown to men.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.700]   Something stated to men.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.020]   Something given to men.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.020]   Not men trying to arrive at something.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.940]   Now this is the claim of the Bible everywhere.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.020]   You know how the Bible puts it.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.660]   Let me give you a very rapid summary of the contents of this book.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   I can do it very easily because there's just this one thing, you see.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.420]   It's this.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:07.660]   God formed the nation of Israel out of Abraham in order to do this special thing.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:12.660]   Indeed, I could have gone further back.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:18.700]   God chose one of the sons even of Nuh to do this.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.620]   Shem.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.660]   He there begins to separate the people into himself, but he does it most strikingly in
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.660]   Abraham.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.220]   He calls this man out of his country, Ur of the Chaldeans, and he tells him that he's
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.820]   going to turn him into a nation.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.940]   He's going to form a new nation for himself out of this man, Abraham.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.940]   And he did so.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.860]   But why did he do so?
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.060]   And the answer is this.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:49.300]   He formed this nation in order that through it he might speak to the whole world.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:54.300]   That was the chief function of the nation of Israel.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.940]   God revealed himself and truth to them in a way that he did to no other nations.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:05.580]   He used them as the channels and the vehicle of his great revelation.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.020]   That's the claim that is made in this book everywhere.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.140]   Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it in the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.540]   What advantage then, he says, hath the Jew?
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.220]   Or what profit is there of circumcision?
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.860]   Much every way.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:25.820]   Chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.820]   What's an oracle?
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.020]   An oracle is a statement made by God.
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.620]   The oracles of God.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.100]   That's what the Old Testament is.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.180]   He's referring there to the Old Testament.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.540]   What was the chief advantage of the Jews?
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:42.820]   Well, it was that God gave them the scriptures, the oracles, the Old Testament.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.940]   God made his truth known through this nation of Israel.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:52.460]   While the other nations were worshipping a multiplicity of gods, Mars, Jupiter, Mercurius,
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.060]   and all the rest of them, this people were worshipping one God only, this God who revealed
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.660]   himself to them and had given them the truth concerning himself and various other matters.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.300]   That's what the Bible is.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.220]   God giving the revelation, the knowledge, to this one nation.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.900]   Well now then, how did he give it?
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.260]   He gave it in two main ways.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.220]   God gave them a knowledge and an understanding of life partly by the things that he did to
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.860]   them and the things he did with them.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.780]   In various things that he did to them and with them, he showed his own power.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.260]   The way he brought them out of the captivity of Egypt, the way he took them into the land
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.460]   of Canaan, God was giving a wonderful revelation of himself and of his power.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.740]   Here was this comparatively defenseless race of people up against Pharaoh and his hosts
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.260]   and his chariots, but they're taken in safety.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.460]   They come to the land of Canaan.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.300]   They have to cross Jordan.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.220]   God reveals his power.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.820]   This land of Canaan is occupied by mighty people.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.220]   Some of them are giants, the children of Anak and others, mighty giants.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.100]   Who are they to possess the land?
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.140]   God says, "I will be with you," and he displayed his power.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.260]   Yes, but he didn't do it merely to display power.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.660]   God never does that.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.860]   He displayed the power in order to teach them the truth.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:18.180]   He was there telling them something about himself, about his almighty power, his omnipotence,
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.460]   and his omniscience, and his omnipresence, and all these things.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.100]   Now, that's what God was doing.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.860]   He does it partly in action, but he didn't confine himself to action.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.580]   He gave the revelation also by what he taught them.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.460]   He called Moses up to a mountain.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.340]   He taught him.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.900]   Moses spent 40 days listening to God.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.660]   Moses wasn't up on top of the mountain, sitting in quiet meditation and trying to evolve a
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.820]   philosophy.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:51.020]   God spoke to him, and when he came down, he gave proof of the fact that God had been speaking
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.020]   to him.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.020]   His face was shining.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.020]   He didn't know it, but it was.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.140]   He'd been looking into the glory of God, and it was reflecting from his own face.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.500]   But God had spoken to him.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.140]   He'd given him two tables of law.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.500]   He'd given him these commandments.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.640]   Moses didn't invent the Ten Commandments.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.860]   He said he received them, written by the finger of God.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:12.460]   God revealing himself in teaching, in words, in the law that he gave to the children of
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.460]   Israel.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:19.780]   You see, that's a good summary, isn't it, of those early books of your Bible.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.040]   Then you go on to the prophets.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.660]   They started with Samuel.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.260]   They include people like Elijah and Elisha.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.100]   Then these great writing prophets that we've got here.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.940]   Oh, what about these men?
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.660]   Well, they all say the same thing.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.180]   They say these things are not what we've thought.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.620]   These are the things that God has told us to say.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.900]   The message of the Lord, the word of the Lord came unto me.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.100]   The burden of the Lord came upon me.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.660]   That's what they all say.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.360]   God told them what to say.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.920]   God revealed the truth.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.280]   And God said, "Go and tell the people."
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   And they just went.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.840]   Many of them didn't want to go, but they had to go.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.080]   That's the story of every one of them.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.760]   The psalmist, same thing.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.420]   He's inspired, he says.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.000]   The truth is revealed to him.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.480]   All these men claim that the message that they give is not their message.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.200]   They didn't think it out.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.320]   God revealed it to them.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.360]   Some of them went off into a kind of trance under the power of the Spirit.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.200]   And there they were shown the truth.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.080]   And the Spirit guided them in the writing of the truth, revelation and inspiration.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.840]   That's the meaning of your Old Testament.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:33.400]   And it's all about this one message of God and his relationship to this world.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.960]   And then, of course, you come to the greatest thing of all.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.880]   You turn over into your New Testament, the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   Son of God.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   Who is this?
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.080]   Well, this is how the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.120]   God who at sundry times and in diverse manners in time past spake unto the fathers by the
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:00.360]   prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he hath appointed heir
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.160]   of all things, by whom also he made the worlds, who being the brightness of his glory and
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.080]   the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:17.120]   he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   What does it mean?
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.520]   My dear friend, it means this.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.840]   Here stands one as man amongst men.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.240]   But listen to his claims.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.800]   Who is this?
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.440]   Is this the supreme philosopher?
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.720]   Is this the ultimate estate?
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.480]   Is this the perfect moral exemplar?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   Who is this?
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.400]   Well, ask him.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.520]   Listen to him.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.760]   He claims to be one with God.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.640]   He says, "Before Abraham I was."
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.320]   I and the Father, he says, are one.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.440]   He says, "You are from beneath, I am from above."
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:05.400]   He says, "No man hath ascended unto heaven, but the Son of Man," he says, "who is in him."
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.880]   He's come down from heaven.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.160]   That's his claim.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.720]   He says he's not a man.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   He says he's more.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.880]   He says he's God.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.660]   He says he's God and man.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.840]   These are the claims that he makes for himself.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.980]   Listen to his message.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.200]   He says, "The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.240]   sent me, he giveth me the words.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.360]   The works that I do, I do not of myself.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.160]   The Father that sent me, he doeth the works."
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.080]   He says it's all been given to him.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.960]   He says he's in this world because his Father has sent him.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.120]   He's come on a mission.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.760]   He's come to do something.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.920]   He isn't a man rising up amongst men.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.140]   He's come down from heaven, he says.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.480]   And listen to the authority with which he speaks.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.880]   He says, "You have heard that it was said by them of old time, but I say unto you."
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.280]   He looks at a man and he says, "Follow me."
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.200]   Asks him to leave everything.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.920]   Demands a complete allegiance, a totalitarian allegiance, and calls upon men to follow
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.360]   him.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.840]   That is what he says he was doing.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.240]   He makes a unique claim.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.440]   He says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.080]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.880]   My friends, had you considered this?
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.360]   Here is one who's come from God.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.560]   God raised the prophets.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.960]   God raised the psalmists.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.400]   God raised the patriarchs.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   God gave them all the...
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.900]   Ah yes, in sundry pots and diverse portions, just a little bit here and a little bit there,
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.440]   God was giving the revelation and the message right through the Old Testament.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.320]   But here at last comes the Son of God.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.760]   Comes one out of the Blessed Trinity, the second person, the everlasting Son of God.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:46.960]   God in the flesh, and he speaks authoritatively as one who has looked into the face of God
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   and who is with God.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.560]   "Listen to me," he says.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.200]   Indeed, the voice from heaven says the same thing.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.080]   "This is my beloved Son.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.280]   Hear him."
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.680]   Three times over.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.160]   Now that's the character of this message.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.060]   It isn't something men have discovered.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.760]   It has been delivered, and above all, delivered by the Son of God.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.240]   And then you go on and read your New Testament epistles written by these apostles.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   What is it?
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.440]   Where have they got their message from?
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.720]   They all say the same thing.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.920]   I can summarize it in the words of the apostle Paul.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.160]   This is how he tells the people at Corinth writing to them.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:35.480]   He says, "I delivered unto you, first of all, that which I also received."
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.880]   The apostle Paul, let me remind you, was a Jew and he was a Pharisee and he hated Christ
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.320]   and Christianity.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   But here he is.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.520]   He's been preaching it and he's writing letters about it.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.840]   Where has he got it from?
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.120]   Did he think it out?
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   No, no.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   He says, "I delivered unto you, first of all, that which also I received."
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.440]   He says, "It isn't my idea.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.520]   It isn't my message.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.640]   I was given it by God.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.480]   The Son of God on the road to Damascus commissioned me.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.640]   He told me what to say.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.080]   He sent me with the message.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   It isn't mine.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   It's His."
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.280]   And they all say the same thing and they all are repeating the same message.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.600]   Had you realized that about this book, my friend?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.880]   It is the faith, this one message, and it isn't men's.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   It's God's.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.640]   It's given, delivered.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.280]   There's nothing like it in the world.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.440]   There never has been.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.600]   It's a unique message.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.680]   But let me come to my last point.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:36.440]   The unchangeableness and the finality of this message, that you should earnestly contend
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:45.960]   for the faith which was once and forever—that's the meaning of the word—once and forever
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.840]   delivered unto the saints.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:57.640]   The unchangeableness and the finality of this faith, this message, this teaching that has
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.320]   been delivered to the saints.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.680]   It is unchangeable.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   It is final.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.720]   There will be nothing beyond this or adding to it.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.160]   It is the last word.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   How do I prove that?
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:14.480]   Well, of course, everything I've been saying so far proves it.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.840]   If it is a message from God, it's independent of time, isn't it?
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   You see, God isn't in this process of time.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.520]   He's above it, outside it.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.560]   And as the message is one that comes from God in the way that I've been indicating,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.840]   the passage of time makes not the slightest difference.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.360]   It is the omniscient God who's been speaking.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   And all the advances of knowledge and learning make no difference to him because he has always
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.720]   had absolute knowledge.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.920]   He knows everything.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.560]   He knows the end from the beginning.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.040]   There's nothing hidden from him.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.040]   It is God the omniscient who's been speaking the whole time.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.840]   That is enough in and of itself to prove its utter finality and that it is unchangeable.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.320]   But let me give you some further reasons as I close.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.600]   What is the message of this book?
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:08.880]   Well, essentially, it is a message about God himself.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.640]   Have you realized that?
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   The main purpose of this book is to reveal God to us.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.000]   That's the greatest need of the world tonight is to know God.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.040]   The world is as it is because it doesn't know God.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.240]   If only the whole world knew God, we'd all be down on our knees worshipping him.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.740]   We don't know him.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.740]   That's the tragedy of men.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.740]   He doesn't know God.
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.920]   So the great message of the Bible is to reveal God to us.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   God who made the world, the creator, the God who sustains it, the character of God, his
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:44.440]   eternity, his unchangeableness, his absolute qualities and all that is true of him.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.920]   But all I want to argue tonight is this.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:53.880]   That as the message, the main message of the book is about God, obviously there can't
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.360]   be any change because God doesn't change.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.680]   God is from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.280]   He is the father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow cast by turning.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.680]   He never can be different.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   He can't change.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.000]   He's the absolute eternal God and he's revealing himself.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   You can't add to that.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.560]   There can be no change.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.960]   It's always up to date because it's come from him.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:29.720]   But its second message is this, about man in his relationship to God.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.680]   That's the problem.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   This is the most important thing about man.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.040]   Not what man does or doesn't do, not what man thinks, not men's ideas.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.360]   All these are all right and are quite interesting.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.200]   I'm not here to say that there's no value in having had the internal combustion engine
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.760]   and that there's no point in having these wonderful scientific advances that produce
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.440]   these rockets and so on.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:44:00.120]   All right, my friend, but you know that isn't really your problem and mine.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:07.600]   Man's real and ultimate problem is, as I say, his relationship to God.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.640]   And that is what it's always been.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.920]   This has always been the problem of men.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:20.120]   Job propounded at the dawn of history, "Oh, that I knew where I might find him."
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.040]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:28.960]   His conscience was condemning him and accusing him, "That's your problem tonight and mine."
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.800]   All these other things are irrelevant.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:36.400]   Men's main problem is his relationship to God.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.200]   And man's relationship to God tonight is what it's always been.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.360]   He's in the wrong relationship.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.760]   The moment man fell and disobeyed God, he got into the wrong relationship.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.720]   And he's remained there ever since.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.520]   All the men in the Bible were in the wrong relationship until God brought them into the
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.520]   right one.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.640]   And man is still in the wrong relationship.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:00.120]   There is no change there whatsoever, none at all.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.320]   All your knowledge doesn't make any difference.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.360]   It doesn't bring you any nearer to God.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.800]   All your good deeds, all your almsgiving, it doesn't help you.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   You can do everything.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.620]   You can encompass land and sea.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.680]   You can give your body to be burned.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   It won't help you.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:21.120]   Your relationship to God, it's a standing problem and there is no change at all.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.960]   But lastly and most important of all, what God has done about this relationship between
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:37.000]   himself and men is something that has been done once and forever.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   What is it?
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.640]   Oh, it's what is done in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.920]   You see, the message of this book is about what God has done.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.800]   Not what you and I have got to do, but what God has done for us and about us and concerning
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.480]   our salvation.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:57.800]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   under the law.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.800]   History, this is history.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.120]   Yes, but it's only happened once.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   It's a unique event.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.920]   It isn't somebody thrown up by the process of evolution.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.160]   No, no, it is God sending forth his Son.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.820]   It is the Son of God coming down from heaven to earth.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.720]   It is the Word being made flesh.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   It's unique.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.560]   There is no advance possible here.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.080]   It is once and forever.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.160]   It is a unique action.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.000]   It is God sending his Son into this world.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.880]   It's got nothing to do with the processes of time and of change and of development.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:37.440]   And still more important, is it for us to realize that the same truth applies to his
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.160]   death?
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.440]   What's this message?
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:48.400]   It is this, that God's only Son died on a cross on Calvary's Hill in history, nearly
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   two thousand years ago.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.280]   Only once, never to be repeated.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.760]   He'll never die again.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.240]   There's no development possible.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.800]   There's no advance possible.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.200]   He died once, once and forever.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.440]   He'll never die again, never to be repeated.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   That's Christianity.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:14.520]   These series of crucial, once and for all acts, when the Son bore our sins in his own
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.480]   body on the tree, it happened then, it hasn't happened since, it can't.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.960]   It's happened once and for all.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:26.000]   He's died once at the end of the age, and it's sufficient.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.920]   And he rose from the dead.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.400]   But only once, never again to be repeated.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.600]   No development possible.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.960]   No advance possible.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:41.920]   His resurrection, his rising, his conquest of the grave and its band.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:50.520]   And finally, he will come again into the world, not as he came the first time, that's never
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.080]   to be repeated.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.440]   Not as a babe, not to be crucified and buried and rise again.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:03.440]   No, no, riding the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels, to judge, and it's the
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.480]   last judgment.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.000]   Every one of these acts is final, it's unique, can't be added into no room for development.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.440]   God's acts, and each of them is a final act.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:25.840]   That and that alone is God's way of salvation.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:34.640]   It is what God has done in Christ that opens to us the offer of salvation this evening.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:43.080]   There is therefore none another name under heaven given amongst men, whereby we must
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.920]   be saved.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   He is the eternal Son of God, and it is what he did when he was here in this world that
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.040]   saves us, nothing else.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.280]   All that you and I need he has done.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.680]   It is finished, he said, and it was finished.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.040]   You can't add to it.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   He did everything.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.560]   He's borne the sins, he's borne the punishment, nothing has been left out.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.080]   He has drained that cup to the very dregs.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:21.640]   It is finished, final.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:34.600]   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.520]   The Bible out of date.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.760]   The Bible is alone up to date.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:49.400]   Everything else is temporary, temporary shifts, theories that last for a few years and are
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   then disproved.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.680]   No stability, no safety, everything's moving, everything's fluxed.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.040]   There is only one thing that stands.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   What is it?
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.040]   God.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:09.280]   And what God did once and forever, in his only begotten Son on the cross on Calvary's
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:18.640]   hill, and when he raised him again from the dead, and when he will send him again to judge
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.040]   the world in righteousness.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:34.880]   This is an unchangeable message because it is the final message, because it is God's
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.280]   message.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:44.560]   My dear friend, have you realized it?
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.480]   This is the only answer, the only way.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:58.440]   The faith, once and forever delivered to the saints.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:04.040]   God's way of salvation in Jesus Christ.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.640]   Have you received it?
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.120]   Has this been delivered to you?
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.000]   There is no alternative.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:28.880]   It is God's last, God's final, God's complete act in the Son of Islam.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.240]   Reject this, there is nothing left.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:41.440]   Receive this, you have life which is life indeed, life which is life eternal.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:45.640]   Amen.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.560]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
