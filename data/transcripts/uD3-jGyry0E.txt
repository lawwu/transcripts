[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Pastor John, you have a new title at Bethlehem Baptist Church, the church you led for over
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.400]   thirty years, and along with it there's a new document to explain the new position that
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.180]   you have within the church, and it's titled "Pastor Emeritus, a Covenant between Bethlehem
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.920]   Baptist Church, Council of Elders, and John Piper."
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.500]   Explain for us who wrote this document and why, and what purpose does it serve?
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.360]   It might be helpful, Tony, to share a few thoughts about the role of a pastor emeritus.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.400]   This is the title that the elders at Bethlehem have decided to give me as a member of Bethlehem
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.120]   after thirty-three years as lead pastor for preaching and vision.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.800]   So what about the term emeritus?
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   What does it mean?
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.440]   This is a Latin word referring to one who has "earned his discharge by faithful service."
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.640]   It's kind of the opposite of a dishonorable discharge in the military.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.960]   First Timothy 5.17 says, "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   especially those who labor in preaching and teaching."
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.240]   Well, I was honored a hundred ways while I was a pastor of Bethlehem, and when the title
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.420]   emeritus was proposed for me, I felt honored again, doubly honored, more than doubly honored.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.400]   It's a way of honoring this old guy whose ministry you look back on and say, "I thank
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.200]   God for that."
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.960]   So one might ask, "Well, is it even biblical to retire from the eldership?"
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   And I think the answer is, it's not biblical to lay down ministry and play games till you're
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.720]   dead at 65 to 95.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.580]   That's the typical American view of retirement, and it strikes me as unbiblical.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.320]   But it does seem wise and biblically warranted.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.280]   The priests, for example, stepped aside in the Old Testament when they were 50, not when
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.540]   they were worn out, but when they were 50.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.560]   It does seem biblically warranted and wise to shift one's focuses and hand off certain
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.500]   responsibilities.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.620]   So my focus has shifted off of pastoral leadership of the church onto leadership in the Bethlehem
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.040]   College and Seminary and at Desiring God, and in a real sense, these are elder-like
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   responsibilities.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.720]   I regard what we're doing right now in Ask Pastor John as an extension of the teaching
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.680]   role of my elder qualification.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.360]   So a key question then becomes, why produce a document called a covenant between me and
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.720]   the elders of Bethlehem with a list of ministries that I am committed not to do without the
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.500]   explicit permission or the mandate of the new lead pastor?
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.040]   One good friend of mine said to me when he read it, he said, "It didn't sound like
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.660]   it honored you because it had so many limitations on you, like you're a threat or something."
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.120]   So let me put that in perspective and try to help people understand the nature of this
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.420]   animal and this situation.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.460]   Here's the first thing.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.940]   Except for the proposal that I be called emeritus, I wrote the whole document.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.220]   People can read it over at HopingGod.org.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.240]   I just Googled it a little while ago just to see if it worked, so I typed in "Pastor
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.000]   Emeritus John Piper, Hoping God," and boom, it came right up.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.060]   So they can read it.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060]   We went back and forth tweaking the wording, but virtually everything that's there I
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:06.440]   proposed and I wrote except for the paragraph on honoring me with the title "emeritus."
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.540]   And I did it for reasons.
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.700]   They're biblical and experiential wise reasons, and here's several.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.400]   The New Testament has the expectation that duly appointed leaders will lead.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.620]   So Hebrews 13, "Obey your leaders."
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.380]   First Thessalonians 5.12, "Respect those who labor among you and are over you in the
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.380]   Lord."
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.380]   First Timothy 5.17, "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor."
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.640]   Now combine that biblical principle of "leaders should lead" with the well-known fact of experience
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.860]   that new leadership in an organization can be quickly compromised by well-meaning people
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.420]   who default to treating old leadership as true leadership.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.500]   Add to that this fact.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.420]   I led the church for 33 years as the preaching pastor.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.180]   Imagine, except for a tiny little handful of older people, every single one of the 5,000
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.340]   folks who was there when I left the church last year came under my leadership.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.980]   I'm what they knew as the pastor of Bethlehem, and in that setting, how should people view
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.740]   my role now?
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.300]   Because I'd love to be a member of the church and serve these ministries that have grown
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.360]   out of the church.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.260]   And this covenant is a way of saying John wants the new leadership to lead.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.500]   He wants to guard against any possibility that his influence would weaken or compromise
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.940]   the new leadership in any way.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:53.700]   And the best way to make clear what aspects of ministry I will do without explicit invitation
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.620]   and permission or not do is to put it in a covenant.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.780]   So this is not the restraint of a power-hungry older pastor who can't lay down the reins.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.100]   I hope.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.660]   This is a restraint.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.900]   It's an expression of the zeal of that older pastor who is jealous that nobody touched
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.180]   the reins in the hands of the new leadership, not even inadvertently.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.180]   Let leaders lead.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.180]   That's the first reason for a document like this, to protect the new leadership from any
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.180]   compromise.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.700]   Here's the second one.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.540]   It doesn't just protect that leadership.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:42.660]   It protects and honors my new role as a leader in the seminary and at Desiring God.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.820]   I have a new full-time job that people need to understand.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.900]   About three-fourths of my time I serve at Desiring God with Look at the Book and Ask
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.420]   Pastor John and writing blogs, involvement with the staff.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.460]   And a fourth of my time I'm with the college and seminary as chancellor and professor of
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.540]   biblical exegesis.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.700]   And that's a full-time commitment for this 68-year-old guy who has to pace himself a
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.620]   little differently than he did 30 years ago.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:21.280]   And so the second reason the document is valuable to me and an honor to me is to protect people's
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:28.460]   expectations of me in roles that I don't have anymore and new ones that I do have.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.020]   And the last thing I'd say is that one of the legacies—
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.100]   I left at Bethlehem, I hope, and which is preserved, I hope—is the lesson that I learned
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.900]   over the years that clarity and precision and explicitness, especially in writing, is
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:53.460]   a way of leadership that maximizes accountability, minimizes confusion, minimizes misunderstanding,
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.100]   minimizes selective memory.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.980]   And the best way to do that is write things down and make them precise.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:09.260]   I believe over the years that habit among our elders has served our people really well.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.500]   It has served peace, it has served love, it has served accountability, it has served candor
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   and openness.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.300]   And so I'm happy that we produced a document like this.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.740]   So I'm loving being back at Bethlehem.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.660]   I've been there about six weeks now, worshiping and loving every minute of it.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.340]   I feel honored by the title, "Pastor Emeritus," so that this little event here, "Ask Pastor
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.340]   John," is legitimate.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.340]   And you still use the word "pastor."
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.140]   I love worshiping with the people.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.740]   I'm glad there are clear lines of responsibility and that they're drawn up in a document, and
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.340]   I'm so eager to see God bless this church, bless Bethlehem College and Seminary, bless
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.820]   Desiring God in the next decade, and if God gives me life, I expect to be right at the
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.820]   thick of it.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.300]   And again, you can read the document at HopeInGod.org probably most easily by Googling the title
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.020]   of the document, "Pastor Emeritus, A Covenant Between Bethlehem Baptist Church, Council
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.660]   of Elders, and John Piper."
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.100]   Well, is $75 too much to pay for a Bible?
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.020]   Recently, the website Kickstarter was abuzz with a new Bible project that raised over
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.100]   $1.4 million to produce a really sharp, four-volume Bible.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.100]   You may have seen it.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.620]   Tomorrow, we will talk about how much is too much for a Bible and how important is it to
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.180]   read from an aesthetically pleasing Bible.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.580]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.580]   [END]
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.580]   1.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580]   What is the future of the Bible?
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   2.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   What does the Bible teach us?

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.580]   What is the future of the Bible?
