[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   - So at this point, you guys are 13 and 14 years old.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.200]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.520]   - And the, see, I didn't realize you were that young.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.400]   And so, and this is the first time you saw him switch.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.120]   - He's completely switched, yeah.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.080]   Different person.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.560]   Like, the first time I saw in a man's eyes
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.280]   that he wasn't there.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.120]   - Right.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.400]   - Like, it's like, blink.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.800]   So it was like, if you're like, crying
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.400]   and you're like, begging them to not do
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.200]   what they're gonna do, like, they don't hear you.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.920]   Because they're just, I like, dealt with like, guilt
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.640]   because I left girls behind.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.840]   - Yeah.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.120]   - Like, I don't know what happened to them.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.520]   I don't know where they are.
