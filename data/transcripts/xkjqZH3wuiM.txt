[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Today we again highlight an excerpt from a Q&A Pastor John recently led with the
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   students at Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia. Here's a question asked by
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.800]   one of the students. Hey Dr. Piper, I have a two-part question. The first part is
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.160]   what are some of the most difficult challenges you've faced? And I mean the
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.200]   whole gamut, life, ministry, everything. And then part two, what has sustained you
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.280]   through those? I think the biggest challenges you'll face in the ministry
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.000]   will very likely relate to your family, your marriage, and your children, maybe
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.120]   the wider family depending what culture you're from. That certainly has been true
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.240]   for me. I've told my wife Noel that we've been married 45 years. I said, "Look, all I
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:08.400]   need in the ministry from you is for you to be happy." Because if mama ain't happy...
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:19.920]   And we've gone through really hard times. I mean we've spent one season 33
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.840]   months in counseling together trying to figure out why do we hurt each other
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.280]   like this? Why do our mouths do this to each other? Then you get along okay
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.640]   for ten years and you need to work on it again. We've had pretty battled
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:47.120]   relationship. I love her like crazy and she means she's safe. But why? I don't know.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.040]   I'm baffled at age 68 as to why we have some of these issues. But here's
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.480]   the point. When you walk through a church for 33 years and you have
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   seasons where you get zero growth for four years and 230 people walk away and
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.480]   you're accused of everything under the sun, the way you did church discipline
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.040]   and whatnot. If the collapse at home or the stress at home happens at the same
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.920]   time as the stress at church, you're just about a goner. But if home is making it,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.440]   you can handle anything at church. And if church is making it, you might get through
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.960]   a tough time at home. When they come together, then it'll take a miracle.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.280]   It'll take a miracle no matter what. So that's the main thing
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.600]   I'd say. In the ministry, you will have seasons of great
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.000]   difficulty in the church and you will have probably seasons of great
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.560]   difficulty at home. And if you think all's well, you've been married for 20
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.920]   years and you got a 15 year old, he just may not show up. He may be gone and you
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.520]   don't know where he is. You going to be able to preach next Sunday? I've been there. So there
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.840]   just aren't any things harder than to keep pressing on in the ministry when
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.520]   there are broken pieces in the family. So work on that. I mean, prepare your soul to be a
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.200]   good husband, wife, so that you learn from Jesus how to do marriage. And it is the
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.920]   greatest anvil of sanctification in the world. And that is no accident. That is no
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.000]   accident. Nothing has shown me my sin like marriage and nothing has given
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.840]   opportunities for grace like marriage. So while it's been for me one of the
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.640]   hardest things, it's been one of the most glorious things. So I wrote a
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.440]   book on marriage. I was thinking, I've got to write a book on marriage someday
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.640]   because I'm a Christian hedonist and I want to relate it to everything and
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.840]   marriage is a big deal. And I kept saying, but I'm not ready. We got a
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.720]   phone call one time from Christianity Today. They had a book called
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.000]   Partnership. I don't think it exists anymore. I mean a magazine. And they always had a
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.760]   featured of a smiley pastoral couple on the front. And they called me and said,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.080]   "We would like to put you and Noel on the front and do a special article on you."
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:40.640]   And I said, "You would. Look, we're barely talking right now. So I think you better
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.000]   come back later." And they never called back.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.240]   I had not heard that story before. That was Pastor John recently fielding
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.360]   questions from students at Westminster Theological Seminary. And related to
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   this is the Ask Pastor John episode titled, "What Steals Your Joy?" which is
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.600]   episode number 256 in the archive. It's worth checking out. So what would Pastor
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.280]   John say to sermon listeners who are overly critical of their pastors and who
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.480]   tend to dwell on the faults of a sermon? We will talk about that on Monday. Until
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.440]   then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a great and worship-filled weekend.
