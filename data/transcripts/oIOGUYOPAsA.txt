[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   The following is a conversation with Jay Bhattacharya,
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.200]   professor of medicine, health policy,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.180]   and economics at Stanford University.
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.400]   Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400]   and the blinding, destructive effects of arrogance
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.400]   on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.800]   Jay Bhattacharya is the co-author
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.460]   of the now famous Great Barrington Declaration,
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.860]   a one-page document that in October 2020
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.000]   made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   Most of this podcast conversation
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   is about the ideas related to this document.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.220]   And so let me say a few things here about what troubles me.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.460]   Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.320]   often ignore the quiet suffering of millions
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.160]   that it results in, which includes economic pain,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.560]   loss of jobs that give meaning and pride
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.200]   in the face of uncertainty,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.300]   the increase in suicide and suicidal ideation,
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.840]   and in general, the fear and anger that arises
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.180]   from the powerlessness forced onto the populace
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.080]   by the self-proclaimed elites and experts.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.600]   Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   talk down to the masses about which path forward is right
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.600]   and which is wrong.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.040]   What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   among the policy makers for the common man,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.300]   and in general, for people unlike themselves.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.560]   The landscape of suffering is vast
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200]   and must be fully considered
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.220]   in calculating the response to the pandemic
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.280]   with humility and with rigorous,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.300]   open-minded scientific debate.
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.080]   Jay and I talk about the email from Francis Collins
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.440]   to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two co-authors
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.760]   fringe epidemiologists,
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.560]   and also called for a devastating published takedown
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.240]   of their ideas.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.140]   These words from Francis broke my heart.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.600]   I understand them.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.740]   I can even steel man them,
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.940]   but nevertheless, on balance,
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.680]   they show to me a failure of leadership.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.060]   Leadership in a pandemic is hard,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.620]   which is why great leaders are remembered by history.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.380]   They are rare.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.480]   They stand out, and they give me hope.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.580]   Also, this whole mess inspires me
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.660]   at my small individual level to do the right thing
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.220]   in the face of conformity, despite the long odds.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.420]   I talked to Francis Collins.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.180]   I talked to Albert Bourla, Pfizer CEO.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.540]   I also talked and will continue to talk
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.820]   with people like Jay and other dissenting voices
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.020]   that challenge the mainstream narratives
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.780]   and those in the seats of power.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.900]   I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.660]   in their ideas with respect and empathy,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.180]   but also with guts and skill,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.820]   the skill part I hope to improve on over time.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.780]   And I do believe that conversation
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.340]   and an open mind is the way out of this.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.980]   And finally, as I've said in the past,
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.260]   I value love and integrity far, far above money,
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.960]   fame, and power.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.040]   Those latter three are all ephemeral.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.940]   They slip through the fingers of anyone who tries to hold on
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.260]   and leave behind an empty shell of a human being.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.100]   I prefer to die a man who lived by principles
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.700]   that nobody could shake
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.600]   and a man who added a bit of love to the world.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.860]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.820]   To support it,
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.500]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.200]   And now here's my conversation with Jay Barucaria.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.500]   To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID?
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.680]   Do we have a good measure for this very question?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.180]   - So the best evidence for COVID,
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.020]   the deadliness of COVID comes from a whole series
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.060]   of seroprevalence studies.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.580]   Seroprevalence studies are these studies
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.840]   of antibody prevalence in the population at large.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.940]   I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.940]   one in Santa Clara County, one in LA County,
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.260]   and one with Major League Baseball around the US.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.220]   - If I may just pause you for a second,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.720]   if people don't know what serology is in seroprevalence,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.080]   it does sound like you say zero prevalence.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.040]   It's not, it's sero, and serology is antibodies.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.920]   So it's a survey that counts the number of antibodies--
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   - Specific to COVID, yes.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.880]   - People that have antibodies specific to COVID,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   which perhaps shows an indication
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.160]   that they likely have had COVID,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.680]   and therefore this is a way to study
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.160]   how many people in the population
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.440]   have been exposed to or have had COVID.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.840]   - Exactly, yeah, exactly.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   So the idea is that we don't know exactly
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.520]   the number of people with COVID
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   just by counting the people that present themselves
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.760]   with symptoms of COVID.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.960]   COVID has, it turns out,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.720]   a very wide range of symptoms possible,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.120]   ranging from no symptoms at all
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.920]   to this deadly viral pneumonia
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.480]   that's killed so many people.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.000]   And the problem is like,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.440]   if you just count the number of cases,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.320]   the people who have very few symptoms
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.560]   often don't show up for testing.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   We just don't, they're outside of the can of public health.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.920]   And so it's really hard to know the answer to your question
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.200]   without understanding how many people are infected,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.320]   'cause you can probably tell the number of deaths,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.400]   that's even though that there's some controversy over that.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.360]   But that, so the numerator is possible,
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.120]   but the denominator is much harder.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   - How much controversy is there about the death?
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960]   We're gonna go on a million tangents.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   Is that, okay, we're gonna, I have a million questions.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.560]   So one, I love data so much,
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.520]   but I've like almost tuned out
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.440]   paying attention to COVID data,
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.960]   'cause I feel like I'm walking on shaky ground.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.360]   I don't know who to trust.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.460]   Maybe you can comment on different sources of data,
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.000]   different kinds of data.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.180]   The death one, that seems like a really important one.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.280]   Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.040]   or is it just a giant messy thing that mixed up?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.640]   And then there's this kind of stories about hospitals
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.320]   being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.440]   - So there's some truth in some of that.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.080]   Let me just, so let me just talk about the incentives.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.240]   So in the United States, we passed this CARES Act
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.400]   that was aimed at making sure hospital systems
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   didn't go bankrupt in the early days of the pandemic.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.440]   The couple of things they did,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.640]   one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.800]   tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   And the other thing they did is they gave a 20% bump
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.600]   to Medicare payments for elderly patients
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.440]   who are treated with COVID.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.360]   The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   at, I guess, the early days.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.080]   So that did provide an incentive to sort of have a lot
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.560]   of COVID patients in the hospital,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.760]   because your financial success at the hospital,
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.900]   or at least not the lack of financial ruin,
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.600]   depended on having many COVID patients.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.120]   The other thing on the death certificates
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.080]   is that reporting of deaths is a separate issue.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.520]   I don't know that there's a financial incentive there,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.900]   but there is this sort of complicated,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.240]   you know, when you fill out a death certificate
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.920]   for a patient with a lot of conditions,
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.400]   like let's say a patient has diabetes,
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.040]   a patient, well, that diabetes could lead to heart failure.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.080]   You know, you have a heart attack, heart failure,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.440]   your lungs fill up, then you get COVID, and you die.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.200]   So what do you write on the death certificate?
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.520]   Was it COVID that killed you?
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.220]   Was it the lungs filling up?
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.840]   Was it the heart failure?
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.040]   Was it the diabetes?
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.760]   It's really difficult to like disentangle.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.600]   And I think a lot of times what's happened is
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   people have like erred on the side of signing as COVID.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.120]   Now, what's the evidence of this?
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.640]   There's been a couple of audits of death certificates
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.040]   in places like Santa Clara County,
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.260]   where I live in Alameda County, California,
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.560]   where they carefully went through the death certificate,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.940]   said, okay, is this reasonable to say
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.880]   this was actually COVID, or was COVID incidental?
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.780]   And they found that about 25%, 20, 25% of the deaths
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.360]   were more likely incidental than directly due to COVID.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.440]   I personally don't get too excited about this.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.240]   I mean, it's a philosophical question, right?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.000]   Like ultimately, what kills you?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.360]   Which is an odd thing to say if you're not in medicine,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.320]   but like really, it's almost always multifactorial.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.120]   It's not always just the bus hits you.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.160]   The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.680]   Was the brain bleed that killed you,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.640]   would it have burst anyway?
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.440]   I mean, you know, the bus hits you, killed you, right?
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.120]   - The way you die is a philosophical question,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.820]   but it's also a sociological and psychological question,
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.360]   'cause it seems like every single person
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.140]   who's passed away over the past couple of years,
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.980]   kind of the first question that comes to mind--
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.580]   - Was it COVID. - Was it COVID.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.380]   Not just because you're trying to be political,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.380]   but just in your mind.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.700]   - No, I think there's a psychological reason for this,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.540]   right, so, you know, we spent the better part
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.700]   of at least a half century in the United States
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.300]   not worried too much about infectious diseases.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.820]   And the notion was we'd essentially conquered them.
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.100]   It was something that happens in faraway places
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.980]   to other people.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.020]   And that's true for much of the developed world.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.960]   Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.100]   And for the first time in living memory,
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.340]   we have a disease that can kill us.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.300]   I mean, I think we're effectively evolved to fear that,
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.380]   like the panic centers of our brain,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.000]   a lizard part of our brain takes over.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.940]   And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.420]   And so it's not surprising that people,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.940]   when they're filling out death certificates
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.580]   or thinking about what led to the death,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.980]   this most salient thing that's in the front
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.220]   of everyone's brain would jump to the top.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.860]   - And we can't ignore this very deep psychological thing
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.980]   when we consider what people say on the internet,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.300]   what people say to each other,
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.740]   what people write in scientific papers, everything.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.740]   It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:09.340]   everything changed in the way people feel about each other.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.780]   Just the way they communicate with each other.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.820]   I think the level of emotion involved,
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.420]   I think in many people, it brought out the worst in them.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.220]   For sometimes short periods of time,
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.200]   and sometimes it was always therapeutic.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.720]   Like you were waiting to get out the darkest parts of you.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.260]   Just to say, if you're angry at something in this world,
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.740]   I'm going to say it now.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.020]   And I think that's probably talking
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.660]   to some deep primal thing that fear we have
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.820]   for maladies of all different kinds.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.980]   And then when that fear is aroused
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.020]   and all the deepest emotions,
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.860]   it's like a Freudian psychotherapy session,
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.220]   but across the world.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.060]   - It's something that psychologists
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.200]   are gonna have a field day with for a generation,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.460]   trying to understand.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.160]   I mean, I think what you say is right,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.540]   but piled on top of that is also this sort of,
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.960]   this impetus to empathy,
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.640]   to empathize compassion toward others,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.180]   essentially militarized.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:16.320]   So I'm protecting you by some actions,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.280]   and those actions, if I don't do them,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.760]   if you don't do them, well, that must mean
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.400]   you hate me.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   It's created this social tension
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.240]   that I've never seen before.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.960]   And we have started, we looked at each other
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.620]   as if we were just simply sources of germs,
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.840]   rather than people to get to know,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.180]   people to enjoy, people to learn from.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.840]   It colored basically almost every human interaction
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.200]   for every human on the planet.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.600]   - Yeah, the basic common humanity.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.680]   It's like you can wear a mask, you can stand far away,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.720]   but the love you have for each other
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.200]   when you're looking into each other's eyes,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.920]   that was dissipating, and by region, too.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.960]   I've experienced, having traveled quite a bit
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.320]   throughout this time, it was really sad.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.360]   Even people that are really close together,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.560]   just the way they stood, the way they looked at each other.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.280]   And it made me feel for a moment
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.400]   that the fabric that connects all of us
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.000]   is more fragile than I thought.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.280]   - I mean, if you walk down the street,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.200]   or if you did this during COVID,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.400]   I'm sure you had this experience
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.440]   where you walk down the street,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.720]   if you're not wearing a mask, or even if you are,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.240]   people will jump off the sidewalk
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.460]   that you walk past them as if you're poison.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.920]   Even though the data are that COVID spreads
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.400]   indifferently outdoors, or if at all, really, outdoors.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.480]   But it's not simply a biological
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.360]   or infectious disease phenomenon, epidemiological,
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.680]   it is a change in the way humans treat each other.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.840]   I hope temporary.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.820]   - I do wanna say on the flip side of that,
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.240]   so I was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.480]   when the pandemic broke out.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.440]   I think that's where I was, yeah.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.340]   And then I came here to Austin, Texas
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.560]   to visit my now good friend, Joe Rogan,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.000]   and he was the first person, without pause,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.420]   this wasn't a political statement, this was anything,
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.560]   just walked toward me and gave me a big hug
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.360]   and said, "It's great to see you."
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   And I can't tell you how great that felt
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.760]   because I, in that moment, realized the absence
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.240]   of that connection back in Boston
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.880]   over just a couple of months.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.200]   And we'll talk about it more,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   but it's tragic to think about that distancing,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.880]   that dissolution of common humanity at scale,
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.400]   what kind of impact it has on society.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.220]   Just across the board, political division,
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.380]   and just in the quiet of your own mind,
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.560]   in the privacy of your own home, the depression,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.200]   the sadness, the loneliness that leads to suicide,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.800]   and forget suicide, just low-key suffering.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.400]   - Yeah, no, I think that's the suffering,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.940]   that isolation, we're not meant to live alone.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.400]   We're not meant to live apart from one another.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.440]   I mean, that's, of course, the ideology of lockdown
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.920]   is to make people live apart, alone, isolated,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.360]   so that we don't spread diseases to each other, right?
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.280]   But we're not actually designed as a species
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.180]   to live that way.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.620]   And that, what you're describing, I think,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.080]   if everyone's honest with themselves,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.400]   have felt, especially in places where lockdowns
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.960]   have been sort of very militantly enforced,
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.400]   has felt deep into their core.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.060]   - Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths,
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.580]   you said that the data isn't perfect,
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.480]   because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.940]   to understand how many cases there were
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.960]   to determine the rate of deaths.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.100]   And we need to have a strong footing
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.940]   in the number of deaths.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.800]   But if we assume that the number of deaths
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.280]   is approximately correct, what's your sense,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.720]   what kind of statements can we say
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.920]   about the deadliness of COVID across different demographics,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.840]   maybe not in a political way or in the current way,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.380]   but when history looks back at this moment of time,
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.240]   50 years from now, 100 years from now,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.560]   the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.480]   what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.160]   - I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.480]   depends on not just the virus itself, but who it infects.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.360]   So probably the most important thing about it,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.400]   about the deadliness of COVID is this steep age gradient
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.260]   in the mortality rate.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.880]   So according to these seroprevalence studies
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.680]   that have been done, now hundreds of them,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.400]   mostly from before vaccination,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.760]   'cause vaccination also reduces the mortality risk of COVID,
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.460]   the seroprevalence studies suggest that the risk of death,
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.460]   if you're say over the age of 70 is very high,
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:52.280]   5% if you get COVID, if you're under the age of 70,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.360]   it's lower, 0.05, but there's not a single sharp cutoff.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   It's more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.400]   So if you're 50, say, the infection fatality rate
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.520]   from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data,
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.460]   that means 99.8% survival if you're 50.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.600]   And for every seven years of age above that, double it.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.040]   Every seven years of age below that, have it.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.920]   So a 57-year-old would have a 0.4%,
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.680]   mortality, a 64-year-old would have a 0.8% and so on.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.640]   And if you have a severe chronic disease like diabetes
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.520]   or if you're morbidly obese,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.440]   it's like adding seven years to your life.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.080]   - And this is for unvaccinated folks.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.960]   - This is unvaccinated before Delta also.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.160]   - Are there a lot of people
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.580]   that would be listening to this with PhDs
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.960]   at the end of their name that would disagree
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.480]   with the 99.8, would you say?
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.960]   - So I think there's some disagreement over this.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.980]   And the disagreement is about the quality
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.280]   of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.920]   So as I said earlier, I was a senior investigator
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.640]   in three different seroprevalence studies
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   very early in the epidemic.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.080]   I view them as very high-quality studies.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.600]   In Santa Clara County, what we did
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   is we used a test kit that we obtained
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.040]   from someone who works in Major League Baseball, actually.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.320]   He'd ordered these test kits very early, March 2020,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.880]   that very accurately measures antibodies
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.040]   in the bloodstream.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.680]   These test kits were approved by the,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.000]   had a EUA, Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.760]   sort of shortly after we did this.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.240]   And it had a very low false positive rate.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.480]   False positive means if you don't have
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.080]   these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.320]   the kit shows up positive anyways.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.420]   That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.040]   And based on studies, a very large number of studies
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.520]   looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.320]   and 0.5% of the time, 2018,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.600]   there shouldn't be antibodies there to COVID.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.400]   So if it turns positive, it's a false positive.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.780]   It's 0.5% of the time.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.080]   And then, like a false negative rate,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.440]   about 10%, 12%, something like that.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.760]   I don't remember the exact number.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.960]   But the false positive rate's the important thing there.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.400]   So you have a population in March 2020 or April 2020
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.320]   with very low fraction of patients
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.560]   having been exposed to COVID.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.760]   You don't know how much, but low.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.380]   Even a small false positive rate
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.440]   could end up biasing your study quite a bit.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.000]   But there's a formula to adjust for that.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.520]   You can adjust for the false positive rate,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.360]   false negative rate.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.160]   We did that adjustment.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.440]   And those studies found in a community population,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.120]   so leaving aside people in nursing homes
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.080]   who have a higher death rate from COVID,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   that the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.440]   and in LA County.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.080]   - Across all age groups in the community,
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   community meaning just like regular folks.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.180]   - Yeah, so that's actually a real important question too.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.200]   So the Santa Clara study,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.400]   we did this Facebook sampling scheme,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.040]   which is, I mean, not the ideal thing,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.160]   but it was very difficult to get a random sample
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   during lockdown, where we put out an ad on Facebook
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.880]   soliciting people to volunteer for the study,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.240]   randomly selected set of people.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.120]   We were hoping to get a random selection of people
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.320]   from Santa Clara County, but it tended to,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.580]   the people who tended to volunteer
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.960]   were from the richer parts of the county.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.320]   Like I had Stanford professors writing,
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.280]   begging to be in the study
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.200]   'cause they wanted to know their antibody levels.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   So we did some adjustment for that.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.760]   In LA County, we hired a firm that had a preexisting
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.520]   representative sample of LA County.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.000]   But it didn't include nursing homes,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.160]   it didn't include people in jail, things like that,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.720]   didn't include the homeless populations.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.800]   So it's representative of a community dwelling population,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.920]   both of those.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.880]   And there we found that both in LA County
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.320]   and Santa Clara County in April, 2020,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.240]   something like 40 to 50 times more infections
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.760]   than cases in both places.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.200]   So for every case that had been reported
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.920]   to the public health authorities,
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.320]   we found 40 or 50 other infections,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.920]   people with antibodies in their blood
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.240]   that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.560]   - So people were not reporting,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.000]   or severe, at least in those days, under-reporting.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.880]   - Yeah, I mean, there was, you know, there's testing,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.000]   I mean, there weren't so many tests available.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.440]   People didn't know, a lot of them,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.840]   we asked a set of questions about the symptoms they'd faced,
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.320]   and most of them said they faced no symptoms,
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.280]   or at the most, 30, 40% of them said
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.400]   they faced no symptoms.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.200]   - And I mean, even these days,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.240]   how many people report that they get COVID
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.080]   when they get COVID?
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.120]   Okay, have those numbers, that 0.2%,
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.400]   has that approximately held up over time?
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   - That is, so if Professor Johnny Anides,
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.240]   who's a colleague of mine at Stanford,
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.920]   is a world expert in meta-analysis,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.080]   one of the most cited scientists on Earth, I think,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.240]   at least living, he did a meta-analysis
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.480]   of now 100 or more of these seroprevalence studies.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.560]   And what he found was that that 0.2%
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.800]   is roughly the worldwide number.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.360]   I mean, in fact, I think he cites a lower number, 0.15%,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.600]   as the median infection fatality rate worldwide.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.920]   So we did these studies,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.240]   and it generated an enormous amount of blowback
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.680]   by people who thought that the infection
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.480]   fatality rate is much higher.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.440]   And there's some controversy over the quality
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.400]   of some of the other studies that are done.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.720]   And so there are some people who look at this
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.400]   same literature and say, well,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.800]   the lower quality studies tend to have lower IFRs.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.200]   The higher quality studies-- - IFR?
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.520]   - Oh, infection fatality, right?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.360]   I apologize.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.720]   I do this in lectures, too.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.600]   - And I'm going to rudely interrupt you
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.680]   and ask for the basics sometimes, if it's okay.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.560]   - No, of course.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.440]   So these higher quality studies,
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.640]   they say, tend to produce higher IR.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.800]   But the problem is that if you want a global
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.840]   infection fatality rate, you need to get
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.480]   seroprevalence studies from everywhere,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.120]   even in places that don't necessarily have
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.560]   the infrastructure set up to produce
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.640]   very, very high quality studies.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.980]   And in poor places in the world,
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.880]   places like Africa, the infection fatality rate
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.240]   is incredibly low.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.520]   And in some richer places, like New York City,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.820]   the infection fatality rate is much higher.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.760]   There's a range of IFRs, not a single number.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.640]   This sometimes surprises people,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.160]   because they think, well, it's a virus.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.800]   It should have the same properties no matter where it goes.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   But the virus kills or infects or hurts
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.760]   in interaction with the host.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.840]   And the properties of both the host and the virus
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.160]   combine to produce the outcome.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.040]   - But you also mentioned the environment, too?
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.600]   - Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.920]   Like, if I'm gonna think about it,
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.840]   the most simplest way to think about it is age.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.240]   Age is the single most important risk factor.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.000]   So older places are going to have a higher IFR
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.040]   than younger places.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.160]   Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.660]   So in some sense, it's not surprising
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.400]   that they have a low infection fatality rate.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.320]   - So that's one way you would explain the difference
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.000]   between Africa and New York City,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.040]   in terms of the fatality rate, is the age, the average age?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.840]   - Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.760]   in New York City, the older populations
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   living in nursing homes were differentially infected,
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.880]   based on, because of policies that were adopted, right?
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.100]   To send COVID-infected patients back to nursing homes
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.320]   to keep hospitals empty.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.880]   - What do you mean by differentially infected?
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.400]   - The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.480]   - Right, okay.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.320]   - So that's what I mean by differentially.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.800]   - It's the policy, it's the person that matters.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.120]   I mean, it's not like the virus just kind of doesn't care.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.320]   I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.640]   And there's also, I mean, there is some contribution
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.020]   from the environment.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   Different regions have different proximity,
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.280]   maybe, of people interacting,
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.120]   or the dynamics of the way they interact.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.720]   - The heterogeneity, I'm like, if you have situations
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.260]   where there's lots of intergenerational interactions,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.480]   then you have a very different risk profile
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.900]   than if you have societies where generations
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.700]   are more separate from one another.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.620]   Okay, so let me just finish, we're real fast about this.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.620]   So you have, in New York, you have a population
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.180]   that was infected in the early days
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.980]   that was very likely going to die,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.140]   had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.220]   And so New York City had a higher IFR,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:48.220]   especially in the early days, than Africa has had.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.880]   The other thing is treatment, right?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.900]   So the treatments that we adopted
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.000]   in the early days of the epidemic,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.200]   I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.080]   - Which treatments?
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.140]   - Using ventilators, like the over-reliance on ventilators
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.540]   is what I'm primarily thinking of,
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.480]   but I can think of other things.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.560]   But that, also, we've learned over time
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.680]   how better to manage patients with the disease.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   So you have all those things combined.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.080]   So that's where the controversy over this number is.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   - I mean, New York City also is a central hub
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.640]   for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.720]   and narratives in article form.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.680]   And I remember there was quite dramatic stories
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.360]   about doctors in the hospitals and these kinds of things.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.480]   I mean, there's very serious, very dramatic,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.840]   very tragic deaths going on, always, in hospitals.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.840]   Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a deathbed,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.200]   that's always tragic, and you can always write
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.320]   a hell of a good story about that, and you should,
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.200]   about the loss of loved ones.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.820]   But they were doing it pretty well, I would say,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.040]   over this kind of dramatic deaths.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   And so, in response to that, it's very unpleasant to hear,
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.080]   even to consider the possibility that the death rate
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.520]   is not as high as you might feel.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.600]   - Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.840]   both by regular people and also the scientific community
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.660]   in response to those studies,
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.220]   those early studies in April of 2020.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.600]   To me, they were studies.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.480]   I mean, they're the kinds of, not exactly the kinds
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.600]   of work I've worked on all my life,
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.720]   but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.840]   and you get responses from your fellow scientists,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.160]   and you change the paper to improve it,
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.240]   and you hopefully learn something from it.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.480]   - Well, but to push back, it's just a study.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.240]   But there's some studies, and this is kind of interesting,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.200]   'cause I've received similar pushback on other topics.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:04.360]   There's some studies that, if wrong,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   might have wide-ranging detrimental effects on society.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.000]   So that's the way they would perceive the studies.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.920]   If you say the death rate is lower,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   and you end up, as you often do in science,
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.920]   realizing that, nope, that was a flaw
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.120]   in the way the study was conducted,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.880]   or we're just not representative of a broader population,
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.020]   and then you realize the death rate is much higher,
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.600]   that might be very damaging in people's view.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.520]   So that's probably where the scientific community
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.640]   sort of, to steel man the kind of response,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.040]   is that's where they felt like, you know,
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.440]   there's some findings where you better be damn sure
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.880]   before you kind of report them.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.400]   - Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right,
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.520]   and it turns out we were right.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.520]   So like, when we, so we released the Santa Clara study
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.800]   via this open science process,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.240]   and this server called MedArchive.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.220]   It's designed for releasing studies
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.880]   that have not yet been peer reviewed
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.520]   in order to garner comment from the scientists
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.580]   before peer review.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.320]   The LA County study, we went through
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.400]   this traditional peer review process,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.640]   and got it published in the Journal
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.600]   of American Medical Association sometime in like July,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.040]   I think, I forget the date, of 2020.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.000]   The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.080]   in this sort of working paper archive.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.180]   The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.960]   we had a result that we thought was quite important,
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.040]   and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it,
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.720]   and also tell the world about it.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.120]   And we wanted to get feedback.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.840]   I mean, that's part of the purpose
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.280]   of sending it to these kinds of places.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.480]   I think a lot of the problem is that
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.860]   when people think about published science,
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.360]   they think of it as automatically true.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.320]   And if it goes through peer review, it's automatically true.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.300]   If it hasn't gone through peer review,
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.920]   it's not automatically true.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.520]   And especially in medicine,
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.880]   when we're not used to having this access
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.400]   to pre-peer reviewed work,
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.880]   I mean, in economics, actually, that's quite normal.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.960]   You, it takes years to get something published,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.640]   so there's a very active debate over,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.480]   or discussion about papers before they're peer reviewed
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.280]   in this sort of working paper way.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.440]   Much less normal, or much newer in medicine.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.520]   And so I think part of that,
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.920]   the perception about what those,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.080]   what process happens in open science
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.380]   when you release a study, that got people confused.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.480]   And you're right, it was a very important result.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.760]   'Cause we had just locked the world down
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.720]   in middle of March, with, I think, catastrophic results.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.960]   And if that study was right, if our study was right,
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.040]   that meant we'd made a mistake.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.840]   And not because the death rate was low.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.800]   That's actually not the key thing there.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.600]   The key thing is that we had adopted these policies,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.240]   these test and trace policies, these policies,
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.000]   these lockdown policies aimed at suppressing
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.060]   the virus level to close to zero.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.900]   That was essentially the idea.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.820]   If we can just get the virus to go away,
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.420]   we won't have to ever worry about it again.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.380]   The main problem with our result,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.740]   as far as that strategy was concerned,
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.300]   wasn't the death rate, it was the 40 to 50 times
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.820]   more infections than cases.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:19.580]   It was the 2 1/2% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.060]   that we identified of the antibodies in the population.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.820]   If that number is right, it's too late.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.120]   The virus is not going to go to zero.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.280]   And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate,
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.880]   we're not going to get the viral level down to zero.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   - So we're gonna have to let the virus go through
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.120]   the entire population in some way or--
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.160]   - No, we can talk about that in a bit.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.440]   That's the Great Barrington Declaration.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.240]   You don't have to let the virus go through the population.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.860]   You can shield preferentially.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.080]   The policy we chose was to shield preferentially
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.480]   the laptop class, the set of people who could work
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.440]   from home without losing their job.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.280]   - Yeah. - And we did a very good job
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.420]   at protecting them.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.080]   - Well, let me take a small tangent.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.620]   We're gonna jump around in time,
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.260]   which I think will be the best way to tell the story.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.580]   So that was the beginning.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.620]   - Yeah, okay, actually, can I go back one more thing
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.800]   for that, 'cause that's really important,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.600]   and I should have started with this.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.000]   What led me to do those studies was a paper
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.640]   that I had remembered seeing from the H1N1 flu epidemic
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.480]   in 2009.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.340]   This is where I had been much less active
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.180]   in writing about that.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.880]   I had written a paper or two about that in 2009.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.800]   There was actually this same debate over the mortality rate,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.680]   except it unfolded over the course of three years,
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.240]   two or three years.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.000]   The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.240]   counted the number of cases in the denominator,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.680]   kind of the number of deaths in the numerator,
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.640]   cases meaning people identified as having H1N1,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.460]   showing up to doctor, you know, tested to have it.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.040]   And the early estimates of the H1N1 mortality
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.980]   were like 4%, 3%, really, really high.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.280]   Over the course of a couple of more years,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.920]   a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies,
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.820]   seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out,
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.620]   and it turned out that there were 100 or more times
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.200]   people infected per case.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.540]   And so the mortality rate was actually something like .02%
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.080]   for H1N1, not the three, like 100-fold difference.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.380]   - So this made you think, okay, it took us a couple of,
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.260]   two or three years to discover the truth
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.800]   behind the actual infections for H1N1,
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.940]   and then what's the truth here,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.060]   and can we get there faster?
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.620]   - Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.180]   as the H1N1 flu did.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.640]   I mean, it spreads via aerosolization,
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.600]   via, you know, so person-to-person breathing,
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.480]   kind of contact up.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.160]   It may be some by fomites,
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.220]   but it seems like that's less likely now.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.740]   In any case, it seemed really important to me
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.540]   to speed up the process
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.900]   of having those seroprevalence studies
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.060]   so that we can better understand who was at risk
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.260]   and what the right strategy ought to be.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.260]   - This might be a good place to kind of,
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.620]   compare influenza, the flu, and COVID
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.740]   in the context of the discussion we just had,
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.380]   which is how deadly is COVID?
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.620]   So you mentioned COVID is a very particular
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.620]   kind of steepness, where the X-axis is age.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.260]   So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.500]   and COVID, because a lot of people
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.700]   outside of the folks who suggested the lizards
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.580]   who run the world have completely fabricated,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.420]   invented COVID.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.860]   Outside of those folks, kind of the natural process
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.620]   by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is say,
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.860]   well, it's just like the flu.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.740]   The flu is a very serious thing, actually.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:03.620]   So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.940]   - Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.960]   It kills, you know, 50, 60,000 people a year,
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.540]   something like that, or depending on the particular strain
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.760]   that goes around, that's in the United States.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.060]   The primary difference to me,
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.900]   there's lots of differences,
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.340]   but one of the most salient differences
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.120]   is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:26.420]   So the flu is more deadly for two children than COVID is.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.300]   There's no controversy about that.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   Children, thank God, have much less severe reactions
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:39.980]   to COVID infection than they do to flu infections.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.820]   - And rate of fatalities and stuff like that.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.860]   - And fatality, all of that.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.020]   - I think you mentioned, I mean,
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.940]   it's interesting to maybe also comment on,
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.800]   I think in another conversation you mentioned
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   there's a U shape to the flu curve.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.940]   So meaning like there's actually quite a large number
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.220]   of kids that die from flu.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.460]   - Yeah, I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu,
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.460]   the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.380]   And that is not the case with COVID.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.820]   More than, I'm gonna get the number wrong,
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.280]   but something like 70, 80% of the deaths
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.440]   are people over the age of 60.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.940]   - Well, we've talking about the fear the whole time, really.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.960]   But my interaction with folks,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.260]   now I wanna have a family, I wanna have kids,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.820]   but I don't have that real firsthand experience.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.860]   But my interaction with folks is at the core of fear
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.900]   that folks had is for their children.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.900]   Like that somehow, I don't wanna get infected
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.900]   because of the kids.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.780]   'Cause God forbid something happens to the kids.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.540]   And I think that obviously that makes a lot of sense,
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.480]   this kind of the kids come first, no matter what,
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.660]   that's the number one priority.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.000]   But for this particular virus,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.420]   that reasoning was not grounded in data.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.980]   It seems like, or that emotion and feeling
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.460]   was not grounded in data. - It wasn't.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.540]   But at the same time, this is way more deadly
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.540]   than the flu just overall, and especially to older people.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.500]   - Yes.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.860]   - Right, so-- - The numbers,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.260]   when the story's all said and done,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.060]   COVID would take many more lives.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.380]   - Yeah, so I mean, 0.2 sounds like a small number,
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.600]   but it's not a small number worldwide.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.580]   - What do you think that number will be by the,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.420]   that's not like, but would we cross,
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.260]   I think it's in the United States,
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.700]   it's the way the deaths are currently reported,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.700]   it's like 800,000, something like that.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.440]   Do you think we'll cross a million?
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.660]   - Seems likely, yeah.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.060]   - Do you think it's something that might continue
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.340]   with different variants?
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.880]   What-- - Well, I think,
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.460]   so we can talk about the end state of COVID.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.020]   The end state of COVID is it's here forever.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.260]   I think that there is good evidence
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.800]   of immunity after infection,
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.340]   such that you're protected both against reinfection
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.340]   and also against severe disease upon reinfection.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.900]   So the second time you get it,
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.700]   it's not true for everyone, but for many people,
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.380]   the second time you get it will be milder,
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.620]   much milder than the first time you get it.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.740]   - Would the long tail, like that lasts for a long time?
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.300]   - Yeah, so just there are studies
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.340]   that follow a course of people who are infected for a year,
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.420]   and the reinfection rate is something like
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.860]   somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.300]   And like a pretty fantastic study out of Italy
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.820]   found that, there's one in Sweden, I think.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.820]   There's a few studies that found similar things.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.820]   And the reinfections tend to produce much milder disease,
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.440]   much less likely to end up in the hospital,
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.100]   much less likely to die.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.540]   So what the end state of COVID is,
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.580]   it's circulating in the population forever,
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.500]   and you get it multiple times.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.980]   - Yeah, and then there's, I think, studies and discussions,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.300]   like the best protection would be to get it,
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.220]   and then also to get vaccinated.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.780]   And then a lot of people push back against that
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.720]   for the obvious reasons from both sides,
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.060]   because somehow this discourse has become
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.820]   less scientific and more political.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.560]   - Well, I think you wanna,
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.100]   the first time you meet it
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.300]   is gonna be the most deadly for you.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.580]   And so the first time you meet it,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.780]   it's just wise to be vaccinated.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.420]   The vaccine reduces severe disease.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.700]   - Yeah, we'll talk about the vaccine,
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.100]   'cause I wanna make sure I address it carefully
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.720]   and properly and in full context.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:38.020]   But yes, sort of to add to the context,
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.360]   a lot of the fascinating discussions we're having
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.060]   is in the early days of COVID,
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.460]   and now for people who are unvaccinated.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.060]   That's where the interesting story is,
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.720]   the policy story, the sociological story, and so on.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.920]   But let me go to something really fascinating,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   just because of the people involved,
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.240]   the human beings involved,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.000]   and because of how deeply I care about science
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.720]   and also kindness, respect, and love, and human things.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.360]   Francis Collins wrote a letter in October, 2020
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.960]   to Anthony Fauci, I think somebody else.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.800]   I have the letter, oh, it's not a letter, email,
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.620]   I apologize.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   Hi, Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.940]   This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.940]   that you're a co-author on.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.640]   This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.120]   who met with the secretary
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.200]   seemed to be getting a lot of attention,
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.920]   and even a co-signature from Nobel Prize winner,
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.680]   Mike Levitt at Stanford.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.160]   There needs to be a quick and devastating
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.760]   published takedown of its premises.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.960]   I don't see anything like that online yet.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.000]   Is it underway?
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.440]   Question mark, Francis.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.280]   Francis Collins, director of the NIH,
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.120]   somebody I talked to on this podcast recently.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.640]   Okay, a million questions I wanna ask,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.600]   but first, how did that make you feel
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.040]   when you first saw this email come to light?
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.920]   When did it come to light?
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.880]   - This week, actually, I think, or last week.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.600]   - Okay, so this is because of freedom of information.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.440]   - Yeah.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.560]   - Which, by the way, sort of,
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.440]   maybe 'cause I do wanna add positive stuff
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.100]   on the side of Francis here.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.840]   Boy, when I see stuff like that,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.600]   I wonder if all my emails leaked.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.440]   (laughing)
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.000]   How much embarrassing stuff.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.120]   Like, I think I'm a good person,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.320]   but I don't, I haven't read my old emails.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.280]   Maybe, I'm pretty sure sometimes I can be an asshole.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.000]   - Well, I mean, look, he's a Christian,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.040]   and I'm a Christian, I'm supposed to forgive, right?
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.080]   I mean, I think he was looking at this
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.780]   Great Barrington Declaration as a political problem
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.520]   to be solved, as opposed to a serious alternative approach
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.000]   to the epidemic.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.280]   - So, maybe we'll talk about it in more detail,
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.000]   but just in case people are not familiar,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.840]   Great Barrington Declaration was a document
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.280]   that you co-authored that basically argues
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.200]   against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID,
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.400]   and you proposed another solution that we'll talk about.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   But the point is, it's not that dramatic of a document.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.920]   It is just a document that criticizes
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   one policy solution that was proposed.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.240]   - But it was the policy solution
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.080]   that had been put forward by Dr. Collins
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.120]   and by Tony Fauci and a few other scientists.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.920]   I mean, I think a relatively small number
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.760]   of scientists and epidemiologists
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   in charge of the advice given to governments worldwide.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.040]   And it was a challenge to that policy
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.960]   that said that, look, there's an alternate path,
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.080]   that the path we've chosen, this path of lockdown
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.000]   with an aim to suppress the virus to zero effectively,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.400]   I mean, that was unstated, cannot work
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.640]   and is causing catastrophic harm
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.860]   to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:23.520]   We put this out in October 4th, I think, of 2020,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.720]   and it went viral.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.160]   I mean, I've never actually been involved
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.960]   with anything like this,
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.600]   where I just put the document on the web
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.280]   and tens of thousands of doctors signed on,
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.220]   hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.200]   It really struck a chord of people,
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.920]   'cause I think even by October of 2020,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.600]   people had this sense that there was something
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.080]   really wrong with the COVID policy that we'd been following.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.120]   And they were looking for reasonable people
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:52.960]   to give an alternative.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.120]   I mean, we're not arguing that COVID isn't a serious thing.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.600]   I mean, it is a very serious thing.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.160]   This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.920]   We were, but we were saying that the policy
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.960]   we're following is not the right one.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.040]   So how does a democratic government
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.560]   deal with that challenge?
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.920]   So to me, that, you asked me how I felt.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.680]   I was actually, frankly, just,
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.900]   I suspected there'd been some email exchanges like that,
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.960]   not necessarily from Francis Collins,
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.000]   around the government around this time.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.360]   almost immediately after we published it,
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.480]   where newspapers mischaracterized it
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.980]   in the same way over and over and over again,
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.040]   and sought to characterize me as sort of
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.880]   a marginal fringe figure or whatnot.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.640]   Sunetra gooped Martin Kulldorff
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.360]   or the tens of thousands of other people that signed it.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.560]   I felt the brunt of that all year long.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.240]   So to see this in black and white,
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.680]   in the handwriting, essentially,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.040]   I mean, the metaphorical handwriting of Francis Collins
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.320]   was actually, frankly, a disappointment,
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   'cause I've looked up to him for years.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.380]   - Yeah, I've looked up to him as well.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.160]   I mean, I look for the best in people,
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.320]   and I still look up to him.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.300]   What troubles me is several things.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:23.180]   The reason I said about the asshole emails
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.740]   I send late at night is,
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.580]   I can understand this email.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:34.120]   It's fear, it's panic, not being sure.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.440]   The fringe, three fringe epidemiologists.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.760]   - Unless Mike Leavitt, who won a Nobel Prize.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.600]   I mean.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.400]   - But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts,
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.880]   I have said things like that about others,
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.320]   like a little bit too unkind,
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.280]   like you don't really mean it.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.860]   Now, add to that, he recently, this week or whatever,
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.240]   doubled down on the fringe.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.960]   This is really troubling to me.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.920]   I can excuse this email,
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.840]   but the arrogance there,
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.720]   Francis honestly broke my heart a little bit there.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.100]   This was an opportunity to, especially at this stage,
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.860]   to say, just like I told him,
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:23.720]   to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.320]   I was wrong to not be open to ideas.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.600]   I still believe that this is not,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   like actually argue with the policy,
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.280]   with the proposed solution.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.120]   Also, the devastating published,
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.880]   devastating takedown, devastating takedown.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   As you say, somebody who's sitting on billions of dollars
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.640]   that they're giving to scientists,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.080]   some of whom are often not their best human beings
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.640]   because they're fighting with each other over money.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.180]   Not being cognizant of the fact that you're,
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.580]   challenging the integrity.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.780]   You're corrupting the integrity of scientists
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   by allocating them money.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.460]   You're now playing with that
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.940]   by saying devastating takedown.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.580]   Where do you think the published takedown will come from?
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.560]   It will come from those scientists
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.300]   to whom you're giving money.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.420]   What kind of example would they give
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.760]   to the academic community that thrives on freedom?
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:33.060]   Like this is, I believe Francis Collins.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.580]   He's a great man.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.700]   One of the things I was troubled by
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.920]   is the negative response to him
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.820]   from people that don't understand the positive impact
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.060]   that NIH has had on society.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.860]   How many people it's helped.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.060]   But this is exactly the,
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.020]   so he's not just a scientist.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.460]   He's not just a bureaucrat who distributes money.
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.700]   He's also scientific leader
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.780]   that in difficult times we live in
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.380]   is supposed to inspire us with trust,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.860]   with love, with the freedom of thought.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.660]   He's supposed to, you know those fringe epidemiologists?
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.860]   Those are the heroes of science.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.380]   When you look at the long arc of history,
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.540]   we love those people.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.420]   We love ideas even when they get proven wrong.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.240]   - That's what always attracted me to science.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.780]   Like somebody, the lone voice saying,
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.980]   oh no, the moon of Jupiter does move.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.740]   I mean, but the funny thing is,
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.780]   Galileo was saying something truly revolutionary.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.940]   We were saying that what we proposed
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:35.860]   in the Great Barrier Reef Declaration
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.900]   was actually just the old pandemic plan.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.160]   It wasn't anything really fundamentally novel.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.340]   In fact, there were plans like this
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.700]   that lockdown scientists had written
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.740]   in late February, early March of 2020.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.420]   So we were not saying anything radical.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.180]   We were just calling for a debate effectively
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.800]   over the existing lockdown policy.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.680]   And this is a disappointment,
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.760]   a really, truly a big disappointment
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.400]   because by doing this, you were absolutely right, Lex.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.280]   He sent a signal to so many other scientists
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.180]   to just stay silent even if you had reservations.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.360]   - Yeah, devastating takedown that people,
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.280]   you know how many people wrote to me privately?
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   Like Stanford, MIT, how amazing the conversation
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.100]   with Francis Collins was.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.840]   There's a kind of admiration because,
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.440]   okay, how do I put it?
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.480]   A lot of people get into science
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   'cause they wanna help the world.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.320]   They get excited by the ideas
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.240]   and they really are working hard to help
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.000]   in whatever the discipline is.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.720]   And then there is sources of funding
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.360]   which help you do help at a larger scale.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.840]   So you admire the people that are distributing
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.780]   the money because they're often,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.800]   at least on the surface, are really also good people.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.780]   Oftentimes they're great scientists.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.820]   So it's amazing.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.460]   That's why I'm sort of,
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:12.920]   like sometimes people from outside think academia
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.520]   is broken some kind of way.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.320]   No, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.960]   It really is a beautiful thing.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.840]   And that's why it's so deeply heartbreaking
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.840]   where this person is, I don't think this is malevolence.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.160]   I think he's just incompetence at communication twice.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.640]   - I think there's also arrogance at the bottom of it too.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.800]   - Yes, but all of us have arrogance at the bottom.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.000]   - Yeah, but there's a particular kind of arrogance.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.800]   So here it's of the same kind of arrogance
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.280]   that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.560]   and says that if you criticize me,
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.440]   you're not simply criticizing a man,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.080]   you're criticizing science itself.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.000]   That is at the heart also of this email.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.480]   The certainty that the policies that they were recommending,
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.080]   Collins and Fauci were recommending
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.480]   to the President of the United States were right.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   Not just right, but right so far right
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.500]   that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.680]   And I think that is really the heart of that email.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.680]   It's this idea that my position is unchallengeable.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.380]   Now to be as charitable as I can be to this,
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.720]   I believe they thought that.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.760]   I believe some of them still think that,
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.840]   that there was only one true policy possible
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.680]   in response to COVID.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.140]   Every other policy was immoral.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.840]   And if you come from that position,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.180]   then you write an email like that.
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.200]   You go on TV, you say effectively,
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.580]   Right, I mean, that is what happens
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.720]   when you have this sort of unchallengeable arrogance
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.040]   that the policy you're following is correct.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.240]   I mean, when we wrote the Great Bank Declaration,
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.720]   what I was hoping for was a discussion
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.720]   about how to protect the vulnerable.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.000]   I mean, that was the key idea to me in the whole thing
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.960]   was better protection of the older population
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.900]   who were really at really serious risk
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.280]   if infected with COVID.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.640]   And we had been doing a very poor job, I thought,
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.240]   to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:16.560]   And what I wanted was a discussion by local public health
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.800]   about better methods, better policies
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.100]   to protect the vulnerable.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:26.120]   So when we were met with instead a series
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.400]   of essentially propagandist lies about it.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.560]   So for instance, I kept hearing from reporters
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.460]   in those days, why do you want to let the virus rip?
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.520]   Let it rip, let it rip.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.960]   The words let it rip does not appear
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.320]   in the Great Bank Declaration.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.720]   The goal isn't to let the virus rip.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.080]   The goal is to protect the vulnerable,
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.400]   to let society go as open schools and do other things
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.200]   that it functions best it can
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.880]   in the midst of a terrible pandemic, yes,
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.920]   but not let the virus rip
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.560]   where the most vulnerable aren't protected.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.240]   The goal was to protect the vulnerable.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.480]   So why let it rip?
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.600]   Because it was a propaganda term
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   to hit the fear centers of people's brains.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.060]   Oh, these people are immoral.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.720]   They just want to let the virus go through society
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.980]   and hurt everybody.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.040]   That was the idea.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.360]   It was a way to preclude a discussion
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.960]   and preclude a debate about the existing policy.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.740]   So I have this app called Clubhouse.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:29.440]   I've gone back on it recently to practice Russian,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.080]   unrelated for a few big Russian conversations coming up.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.440]   Anyway, it's a great way to talk
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.980]   to regular people in Russian.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.400]   But I also, there was a, I was nervous.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.760]   I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.520]   and there was a vaccine room.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.580]   And so I joined it.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:49.000]   And it was a pro-science room.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.080]   These are like scientists
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.720]   that were calling each other pro-science.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.400]   The whole thing was like theater to me.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.200]   I mean, I haven't thoroughly researched,
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.240]   but looking at the resume,
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.240]   they were like pretty solid researchers and doctors.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:09.080]   And they were mocking everybody who was at all,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.840]   I mean, it doesn't matter what they stood for,
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.240]   but they were just mocking people.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.880]   And the arrogance was overwhelming.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.760]   I had to shut off
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.040]   'cause I couldn't handle that human beings
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.440]   can be like this to each other.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.480]   And then I went back just to double check,
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   is this really happening?
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.920]   How many people are here?
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.440]   Is this theater?
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.520]   And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.680]   to make a couple of comments.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.600]   And then as I opened my mouth and say,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.680]   "Thank you so much.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.960]   "This is a great room."
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.920]   Sort of the usual civil politeness,
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.720]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   And I said, "I'm worried that the kind of arrogance
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.440]   "with which things are being discussed here
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.400]   "will further divide us, not unite us."
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   And before I said even the unite us, further divide us,
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.280]   I was thrown off stage.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.320]   Now, this isn't why I mentioned platform,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.400]   but I am like Lex Friedman, MIT,
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.720]   which is something those people
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.440]   seem to sometimes care about,
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.320]   followers and stuff like that.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.160]   Did you just do that?
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.000]   And then they said, "Enough of that nonsense.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.720]   "Enough of that nonsense."
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.400]   They said to me, "Enough of that nonsense."
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.520]   Somebody who is obviously interviewed, Francis Collins,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.040]   is the Pfizer CEO.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.760]   - You're bringing on French epidemiologists also.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.720]   But this broke my heart, the arrogance.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.120]   And this is, echoes of that arrogance
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.560]   is something you see in this email.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.160]   And I really would love to,
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.440]   we have a million things to talk about
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.400]   to try to figure out how can we find a path forward.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.240]   - I think a lot of the problems we've seen
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.040]   in the discussion over COVID,
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.560]   especially in the scientific community,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.360]   there's two ways to look at science, I think,
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.200]   that have been competing with each other for a while now.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.800]   One way, and this is the way that I view science
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.920]   and why I've always found it so attractive,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.200]   is an invitation to a structured discussion
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.080]   where the discussion is tempered by evidence,
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.040]   by data, by reasoning and logic.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.240]   So it's a dialectical process where if I believe A
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.560]   and you believe B, well, we talk about it,
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.760]   we come up with an experiment
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.640]   that distinguishes between the two.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.920]   And while B turns out to be right,
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.080]   I'm all frustrated, but I buy you dinner.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.480]   And I say, "No, no, no, C."
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.440]   And then we go on from there.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.320]   That's what science is at its best.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.400]   It's this process of using data in discussion.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.720]   It's a human activity, right?
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   To learn, to have the truth unfold itself before us.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.400]   On the other hand, there's another way
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.800]   that people have used science or thought about science
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.400]   as truth in and of itself, right?
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.880]   This like, if it's science,
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.720]   therefore it's true automatically.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.280]   What does the science say to do?
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.240]   Well, the science never says to do anything.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.720]   The science says, "Here's what's true."
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.720]   And then we have to apply our human values to say,
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.920]   "Okay, well, if we do this,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.840]   "well, then this is likely to happen."
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.000]   That's what the science says.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.960]   "If we do that, then that is likely to happen.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.480]   "Well, we'd rather have this than that, right?"
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.360]   But science doesn't tell us
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.200]   that we'd rather have this than that.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.640]   It's our human values that tell us
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.520]   that we'd rather have this than that.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.080]   Science plays a role, but it's not the only thing.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.880]   It's not the only role.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.080]   It's like, it helps us understand the constraints we face,
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.560]   but it doesn't tell us what to do
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.240]   in face of those constraints.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.600]   - But underneath it, at the individual level,
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.800]   at the institutional level,
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   it seems like arrogance is really destructive.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.760]   So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   So sort of always not being sure that you're right.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:04.240]   This is actually kind of,
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.680]   Stuart Russell talks about this for AI research.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.360]   "How do you make sure that AI, super intelligent AI,
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.360]   "doesn't destroy us?"
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.400]   You built in a sort of module within it
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.560]   that it always doubts its actions.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.160]   Like it's not sure.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.200]   Like I know it says I'm supposed to destroy all humans,
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.800]   but maybe I'm wrong,
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.860]   and that maybe I'm wrong is essential for progress,
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.880]   for actually doing in the long arc of history,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.760]   not the perfect thing,
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.480]   but better and better and better and better.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.680]   I mean, the question I have here for you is,
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.160]   this email so clearly captures some,
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.240]   maybe echo, but maybe a core to the problem.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.040]   Do you put responsibility of this email,
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.920]   of the shortcomings and failures
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.080]   on individuals or institutions?
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.680]   Is this Francis Collins-Antonis?
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.320]   - No, this is an institutional failure, right?
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.200]   So the NIH, so I've had two decades of NIH funding.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   I've sat on NIH review panels.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.800]   The purpose of the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:08.080]   The purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.600]   To some extent, it's also to help scientists,
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.760]   to direct scientists to work on things
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.520]   that are very important for public health,
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.120]   or for the health of the public.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.720]   So, and the way you do that is you say,
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.840]   okay, we're gonna put $50 million on the research
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.480]   in Alzheimer's disease this year,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.240]   or $70 million on HIV, or whatever it is, right?
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.020]   And that pot of money,
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.340]   then scientists compete with each other
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:36.140]   for the best ideas to use it to address that problem.
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:38.380]   So it's essentially an endeavor
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.320]   to support the work of scientists.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.060]   It is not in and of itself a policy organ.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.220]   It doesn't say what public health policy should be.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.580]   For that, you have the CDC.
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:55.280]   And what happened during the pandemic
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   is that people in the NIH were called upon
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.740]   to contribute to public health policymaking.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.900]   And that created the conflict of interest
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.060]   you see in that email, right?
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.900]   So now you have the head of the NIH
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.060]   in effect saying to all scientists,
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:19.120]   you must agree with me in the policy that I've recommended,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.160]   or else you're a fringe.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.340]   That is a deep conflict of interest.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.460]   It's deep because first, he's conflicted.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:31.620]   He has this dual role as the head of the NIH,
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.100]   supporter of scientific funding,
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.940]   and then also inappropriately called
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.460]   to set or help set pandemic policy.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.900]   That should never have happened.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:44.360]   There should be a bright line between those two roles.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.180]   - Let me ask you about just Francis Collins.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.020]   I don't know if you,
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.820]   I had a chance to talk to him on a podcast.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.140]   I don't know if you maybe by chance
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.900]   gotten a chance to hear a few words.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.420]   - I heard some of it, yeah.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.740]   - Well, I have a kind of a question to that
[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:01.380]   because a lot of people wrote to me quite negative things
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.580]   about Francis Collins.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.780]   And like I said, I still believe he's a great man,
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.940]   a great scientist.
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:13.420]   One of the things when I talked to him off mic
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.780]   about the vaccine,
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:21.240]   the excitement he had about when we were recollecting
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.540]   when they first gotten an inkling
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:26.900]   that it's actually going to be possible to get a vaccine.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.900]   Just he wasn't messaging,
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.260]   just in the private or of our own conversation,
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.760]   he was really excited.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.180]   And why was he excited?
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.500]   Because he gets to help a lot of people.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.560]   This is a man that really wants to help people.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.660]   And there could be some institutional self-delusion,
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.680]   the arrogance, all those kinds of things
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.200]   that lead to this kind of email.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.340]   But ultimately the goal is this,
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.780]   I don't think people quite realize this.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.060]   The reason he would call you a fringe epidemiologist,
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.660]   the reason there needs to be a devastating
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.860]   published takedown, he, I believe, really believes
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.380]   that this could be very dangerous.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:09.360]   And it's a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.140]   because like you said, in his role
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.440]   where he defines some of the public policy,
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:19.020]   like depending on how he thinks about the world,
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.660]   millions of people could die because of one decision
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.820]   he make.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.700]   And that's a lot of burden to walk with.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.940]   - Yeah, no, I think that's right.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.420]   I don't think that he has bad intentions.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.820]   I think that he was basically put,
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.380]   he was put or maybe put himself in a position
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.060]   where this kind of conflict of interest
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.700]   was going to create this kind of reaction.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.540]   The kind of humility that you're calling for
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.100]   is almost impossible when you have that dual role
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.360]   that you shouldn't have as funder of science
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.460]   and also setter of scientific policy.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.500]   - I agree with everything you just said
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.700]   except the last part.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.100]   The humility is almost impossible.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.660]   Humility is always difficult.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.780]   I think there's a huge incentive
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.700]   for humility in that position.
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.520]   Now look at history.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.520]   Great leaders that have humility are popular as hell.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.760]   So if you like being popular,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.660]   if you like having impact, legacy,
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.240]   these descendants of apes seem to care about legacy,
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.980]   especially as they get older in these high positions.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.380]   I think the incentive for humility is pretty high.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.360]   - Well, the thing is there's a lot
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.040]   that he has to be proud of in his career.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.040]   The Human Genome Project wouldn't have happened without him.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.480]   And he is a great man and a great scientist.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.680]   So it is tragic to me that his career
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.320]   has ended in this particular way.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.080]   - Can I ask you a question
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.700]   about my podcast conversation with him?
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.240]   By way of advice or maybe criticism,
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.260]   there's a lot of people that wrote to me
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.220]   kind words of support
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.740]   and a lot of people that wrote to me
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.340]   respectful, constructive criticism.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.180]   How would you suggest to have conversations
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.840]   with folks like that?
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.020]   And maybe, I mean,
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.900]   'cause I have other conversations like this,
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.900]   including I was debating whether to talk
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.220]   to Anthony Fauci, he wanted to talk.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.820]   And so what kind of conversation do you have?
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.620]   And sorry to take us on a tangent,
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.300]   but almost from an interview perspective
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:31.780]   of how to inspire humility and inspire trust in science
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.460]   or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we're doing
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.700]   and we're gonna figure this out.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.500]   - I mean, I think I've been now interviewed by many people.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.460]   I think the style you have really works well, Lex.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.540]   You have to, 'cause I don't think you're gonna be ever
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.540]   an attack dog trying to go after somebody
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.940]   and force them to like,
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.460]   you know, submit that they were wrong
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.820]   or whatever about them.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.740]   I mean, I also actually find that form of journalism
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.500]   and podcasting really off-putting.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.940]   It's hard to watch.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.100]   - Also, it's a whole other tangent.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.380]   Is that actually effective?
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.220]   - I don't think so.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.140]   - Do you wanna ask Hitler,
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.060]   and I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.580]   I've been studying a lot about the rise and fall
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.140]   of the Third Reich.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.660]   I think about interviewing Stalin.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.520]   Like I put myself in that mindset,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.700]   like how do you have conversations with people
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.300]   to understand who they are,
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.220]   so that not so you can sit there and yell at them,
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.340]   but to understand who they are
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.420]   so that you can inspire a very large number of people
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.380]   to be the best version of themselves
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.220]   and to avoid the mistakes of the past.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.700]   - I believe that everyone that's involved in this debate
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.180]   has good intentions.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.920]   They're coming at it from their points of view.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.180]   They have their weaknesses,
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.820]   and if you can paint a picture in your questioning,
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.820]   by sympathetic questioning,
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.180]   of those strengths and weaknesses
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.340]   and their point of view, you've done a service.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.180]   That's really all I personally like to see
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.100]   in those kinds of interviews.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.340]   I don't think a gotcha moment is really the key thing there.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:09.340]   The key thing is understanding where they're coming from,
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.660]   understanding their thinking,
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.340]   understanding the constraints they faced
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.140]   and how did they manage them.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.720]   That's gonna provide a much,
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.100]   I mean, to me, that's what I look for
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.860]   when I listen to podcasts like yours,
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.640]   is an understanding of that person and the moment
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.260]   and how they dealt with it.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:29.220]   - I mean, I guess the hope is to discover
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:33.820]   in a sympathetic way a flaw in a person's thinking together.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.140]   Like as opposed to discovering the positive thing together,
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.500]   you discover the thing,
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.860]   where I didn't really think about that.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.940]   - Yeah, I mean, that's how science is, right?
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.220]   That's why we find it so attractive,
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.780]   is this, I like it when a student shows me
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.780]   I'm thinking incorrectly, right?
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.960]   I'm really grateful to that student
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.300]   because now I have an opportunity to change my mind about it
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.980]   and then start thinking even more correctly.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.540]   I mean, and there are moments when,
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.020]   I mean, like this is probably a good time to say
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.900]   like what I think I got wrong during the pandemic, right?
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.060]   So like, for instance, you said Francis Collins
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:14.780]   had a moment when he learned that there was quite possible
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.660]   to get a vaccine going.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.100]   He must've learned that quite early.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.540]   And I didn't learn that early.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:25.060]   I mean, I didn't know in March of 2020,
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.140]   in my experience with vaccine development,
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.380]   it would have take, I thought it would take a decade
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.720]   or more to get a vaccine.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.220]   That was wrong, right?
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.020]   I didn't, and I was so happy
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.420]   when I started to see the preliminary numbers
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.940]   in the Pfizer trial that strongly suggested
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.980]   it was going to work.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.180]   - Yeah.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.420]   - And I was, I can't, I mean, like very few times
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.960]   in my life I've been so happy to be wrong.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.340]   - And it changes kind of,
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.420]   I think I've heard you mention that a lockdown
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.980]   is still a bad idea unless the vaccine comes out
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.800]   in like tomorrow.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:05.300]   There's still like suffering and economic pain,
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.100]   all kinds of pain can still happen
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:12.100]   in even just a scale of weeks versus months.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.100]   - Yeah.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.320]   - Well, let's talk about the vaccine.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.940]   What are your thoughts on the safety and efficacy
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.900]   of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:26.260]   - So for the vaccine safety data,
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:30.140]   it's actually challenging to convey to the public
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.500]   how this is normally done.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.420]   Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.020]   You'd have a long trial with large numbers,
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.700]   relatively large numbers of people.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.100]   You'd follow them over a long time
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.380]   and the trial will give you some indication
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.740]   of the safety of the vaccine.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.140]   And it did.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:49.620]   I mean, but the trial, the way it was constructed,
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.780]   when it was came out that it was protective against COVID,
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.140]   it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.940]   And so that placebo arm was vaccinated,
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.140]   what large part of it.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.300]   And so that meant that from the trial,
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.220]   you are not going to be able to get data
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.720]   on the long-term safety profiles of the vaccine.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.220]   And also the other thing about trials,
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.020]   there's tens of thousands of people enrolled.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.500]   That's still not enough to get,
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.980]   when you deploy a vaccine at population scale,
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.260]   you're gonna see things that weren't in the trial,
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.100]   guaranteed.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.820]   Populations of people that weren't represented well
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.900]   in the trial are gonna be given the vaccine
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.020]   and then they're gonna have things that happen to them
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.300]   that you didn't anticipate.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.300]   So I wasn't surprised when people were a little bit skeptical
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.620]   when the trial was done about the safety profile,
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.740]   just the way the nature of the thing was gonna make it
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.700]   so that it was gonna be hard to get a complete picture
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.140]   from the trials itself.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.560]   And the trial showed they were pretty safe
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.300]   and quite effective at preventing both you
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.580]   from getting COVID.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.900]   I think the main end point of the trial itself
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.280]   was a symptomatic COVID.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:02.580]   Right, so that was, I mean, it was really,
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.620]   to me, like it was about as amazing achievement as anything,
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.740]   organizing a trial of that scale and running it so quickly.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.420]   - And the final results being so surprisingly high.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.540]   - So good, right?
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:22.820]   But the problem then was normally it would take a long time.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.460]   The FDA would tell Pfizer to go back
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.140]   and try it in this subgroup.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.660]   They'd work more on dosing.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.980]   They do all these kinds of things that kind of didn't,
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.340]   we really didn't have time for
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.800]   in the middle of the pandemic, right?
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   So you have a basis for approval that it's less full
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.120]   than normally you would have for a population scale vaccine.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.380]   But the results were good.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.540]   The results looked really good.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.980]   And actually I should say for the most part,
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.980]   that's been borne out when we've given the vaccine at scale
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.960]   in terms of protection against severe disease.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.800]   - Yeah.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.300]   - So people who have got the vaccine for a very long time
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.660]   after they've had the full vaccination
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.740]   have had great protection against going,
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.460]   being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.440]   - Let's separate, 'cause this seems to be,
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.020]   there's critics of both categories, but different.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.940]   Kids and kids, not older people,
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.300]   like let's say five years old and above or something like,
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.060]   or 13 years old and above.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:31.060]   So for those, it seems like the reduction
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:35.920]   of the rate of fatalities and serious illness
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.280]   seems to be something like 10X.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.320]   - I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.020]   It transforms the problem of focus protection
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.220]   from something that's quite challenging,
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.820]   possible, I believe, but quite challenging
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.160]   to something that's much, much more manageable.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.960]   Because the vaccine in and of itself,
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.240]   when deployed in older populations,
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.800]   is a form of focus protection.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.320]   - Yes, by the way, we'll talk about the focus protection
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.720]   in one segment, 'cause it's such a brilliant idea
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.480]   for this pandemic of future pandemics.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.760]   I thought the sociological, psychological discussion
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.020]   about the letter from Francis Collins is,
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.380]   because it was so recent, it's been so troubling to me,
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.200]   so I'm glad we talked about that first.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.920]   But so there seems to be, the vaccines work
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.320]   to reduce deaths, and that has especially
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.280]   the most transformative effects for the older folks.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.080]   - I've told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.520]   Let me tell you the second thing I got wrong,
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.240]   for sure, in the pandemic.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:43.040]   In January of this year, 2021,
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.640]   I thought that the vaccines would stop infection.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.920]   - Yes.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.640]   - It would make it so that you were much less likely
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.280]   to be infected at all, because the antibodies
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.800]   that were produced by the vaccines looked like
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.880]   they were neutralizing antibodies that would
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.320]   essentially block you from being infected at all.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.280]   That turned out to be wrong.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.260]   I think, and it became clear as data came out from Israel,
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.280]   which vaccinated very early, that they were seeing
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.860]   surges of infection, even in a very highly
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:19.980]   vaccinated population, that the vaccine
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.780]   does not stop infection.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.220]   - So you're a used car salesman,
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.180]   and you were selling the vaccine,
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.460]   and the features you thought a vaccine would have,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.100]   I mean, I have a similar kind of sense
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.660]   when the vaccine came out.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.660]   Vaccine would reduce, if you somehow were able to get it,
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.340]   it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things,
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.260]   but it would also reduce the chance of you getting it,
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:47.100]   and if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.880]   to somebody else.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.180]   And it turns out that those latter two things
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:55.820]   are not as definitive, or in fact,
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.860]   I mean, I don't know to what degree they're not there at all.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:59.260]   - I think it's a little complicated,
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.560]   'cause I think the first two or three months
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.300]   after you're fully vaccinated, after the second dose,
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:09.300]   you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.700]   So, which is pretty good, right?
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.740]   But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.140]   Some places, some studies, like there's a study
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.500]   out of Sweden that suggested it might even drop to zero.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.380]   - But, and then you're also infectious
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.700]   for some period of time, if you do get it,
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.980]   even though you're vaccinated.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.820]   - Correct.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.820]   - Although there seems to be loosely dated
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.860]   that the period of time you're infectious is shorter.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:36.500]   - Is shorter, but the infectivity per day is about as high.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.340]   So you're still, the point is that the vaccine
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.820]   might reduce some risk of infecting others,
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:44.820]   but it's not a categorical difference.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.660]   So, it's not safe to be in the presence
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.220]   of just vaccinated people.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.660]   You can still get infected.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.180]   - Right, so, I mean, there's a million things
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.700]   I wanna ask here, but is there in some sense,
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:04.700]   because the vaccine really helps on the worst part
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.300]   of this pandemic, which is killing people.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.140]   - Yes.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.340]   - Doesn't that mean, where does the vaccine hesitancy
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:17.660]   come from in terms of, it seems like,
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:20.580]   obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.580]   to let us open this thing up?
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.580]   - Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.540]   with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year,
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:30.260]   a very, with a very naive title, which says,
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.260]   "We can end the lockdowns in a month."
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.900]   And the idea is very simple.
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.920]   Vaccinate all vulnerable people,
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.700]   and then open up.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.540]   - Open up.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.180]   - Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms,
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.100]   this is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.420]   The Great Barrington Declaration said,
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.100]   "The lockdown harms are devastating
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.160]   "to the population at large.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.880]   "There's this considerable segment of people
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.340]   "that are vulnerable, protect them."
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.300]   Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.740]   to protect the vulnerable, which is, I still believe,
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.300]   I mean, it's true, right?
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.180]   You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population,
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.380]   and as you said, it's a tenfold decrease
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.180]   in the mortality risk from getting infected,
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.980]   which is, I mean, amazing.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.220]   So that was the strategy we outlined.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.460]   What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed.
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.860]   So first, so you're asking about vaccine hesitancy.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.000]   I think there's, first, there's the inherent limitations
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.440]   of how to measure vaccine safety, right?
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.620]   So we talked a little bit about it in the trial,
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:35.140]   but also after the trial, there's a mechanism,
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.940]   and this is the work I've been involved with before COVID,
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:42.440]   on tracking and identifying and checking
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.980]   whether the vaccines actually are safe,
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.380]   and the central challenge is one of causality.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.380]   So you no longer have the randomized trial,
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.780]   but you wanna know, is the vaccine,
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.840]   when it's deployed at scale, causing adverse events?
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.100]   Well, you can't just look at people who are vaccinated
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.100]   and see what adverse events happen,
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.020]   'cause you don't know what would have happened
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.080]   if the person had not been vaccinated.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.820]   So you have to have some control group.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.100]   Now, what happened is there's several systems
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.700]   to check this that the CDC uses.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.220]   One very, very commonly known one now is called VAERS,
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.580]   the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.700]   There, anyone who has an adverse event,
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.740]   either a regular person or a doctor, can just go report,
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.300]   "Look, I had the vaccine, and two days later,
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.700]   "I had a headache," or whatever it is.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.260]   The person died a day after they had the vaccine, right?
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.640]   Now, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first,
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:42.140]   and older people die sometimes, with or without the vaccine.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.700]   So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated,
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.660]   and a few days later, they die.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.500]   Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it?
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.300]   It's really difficult to tell.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.460]   In order to tell, you need a control group.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:58.500]   For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have.
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:02.340]   Like, there's one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Data Link.
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:04.100]   There's another system called BEST.
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.860]   I forget what the acronym is.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:11.460]   To essentially to track cohorts of people,
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.900]   vaccinated versus unvaccinated,
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.660]   with as careful of a matching as you can do.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:20.660]   It's not randomized, and see if you have safety signals
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.660]   that pop up in the vaccinated
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.820]   relative to the control group unvaccinated.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:31.020]   And so that's, for instance, how the myocarditis risk
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:34.220]   was picked up in young, especially young men.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.980]   It's also how the higher risk of blood clots
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.020]   in middle-aged and older women,
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.820]   with the J&J vaccine was picked up.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.980]   There, what you have are situations where
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.420]   the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:54.060]   that if you see them in the vaccinated arm at all,
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.460]   then it's not hard to understand
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.380]   that the vaccine did this, right?
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.500]   Young men should not be having myocarditis.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.260]   Middle-aged women should not be having
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.380]   huge blood clots in the brain, right?
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.860]   So when you see that, you can say it's linked.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.340]   Now, the rates are low.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.500]   So young men, maybe one in 5,000,
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.220]   one in 10,000 of the vaccine-related myocarditis,
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.100]   pericarditis.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:18.420]   Young women, middle-aged women, I don't know.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.660]   I'm not sure what the right number might be,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.660]   but I'd say it's like one in hundreds of thousands,
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.660]   something like that.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.900]   So these are rare outcomes,
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:30.980]   but they are vaccine-linked outcomes.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.780]   How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.380]   I think you just tell people.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.820]   You tell people here are the risks.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.940]   You transparently tell them.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.180]   So they're not getting into something that they don't know.
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:45.500]   - Yeah, and don't treat people like they're children
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.700]   and need to be told lies because they won't understand
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.980]   the full complexity of the truth.
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.220]   People, I think, are pretty good at,
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.260]   or actually, people with time
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.660]   are good at understanding data,
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.500]   but better than anything,
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:08.420]   they're extremely good at detecting arrogance and bullshit.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.780]   And you give them either one of those.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.700]   - I mean, I'll give you one
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.100]   that's where I think it's greatly undermined vaccine has,
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.620]   greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:20.460]   is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID,
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:24.100]   you have extremely good immunity,
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:27.100]   both against infection and access to the vaccine.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.860]   And that denial leads to people distrusting the message
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.900]   given by the CDC director, for instance,
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.780]   in favor of the vaccine.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:39.740]   Why would you deny a thing that's such an obvious fact?
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.180]   You can look at the data,
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.700]   and it just pops out at you
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.860]   that people that are COVID recovered
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.760]   are not getting infected again at very high rates,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.340]   much lower rates.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.220]   - After these kinds of conversations,
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.580]   I'm sure after this very conversation,
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.460]   I often get a number of messages from Joe, Joe Rogan,
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:03.620]   and from Sam Harris, who to me are people I admire.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.580]   I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.440]   They also have a platform.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.140]   And I believe, at least in my mind,
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.140]   about this COVID set of topics,
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.260]   they represent a group of people.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:24.420]   Each group has smart, thoughtful,
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.940]   well-intentioned human beings.
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.340]   And I don't know who is right,
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:35.340]   but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit,
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:37.220]   those groups.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:41.080]   And so the question I wanna ask is like,
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.060]   what do you think about these two groups
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.900]   and this kind of tension over the vaccine
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.040]   that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.360]   on which to focus on,
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.840]   like whether kids should get vaccinated or not,
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.400]   whether there should be vaccine mandates or not,
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.440]   which seem to be often very kind of specific policy
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.160]   kinds of questions that miss the bigger picture.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.320]   - I think it's a symptom of the distrust
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.460]   that people have in public health.
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.880]   I think this kind of schism over the vaccine
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.600]   does not happen in places where the public health authorities
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.880]   have been much more trustworthy.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.080]   So you don't see this vaccine,
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.880]   hasn't seen Sweden, for instance.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.620]   What's happened in the United States
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.340]   is the vaccine has become,
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.560]   first because of politics,
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.020]   but then also because of the scientific arrogance,
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.100]   this sort of touchstone issue,
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.200]   and people line up on both sides of it.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.560]   And the different language you're hearing
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.820]   is structured around that.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.680]   So before the election, for instance,
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.560]   I did a testimony in the house
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.760]   on measurement of vaccine safety.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.520]   And I was invited by the Republicans.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.440]   There were, I think, four other experts
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.280]   invited by the Democrats,
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.600]   or three other experts invited by Democrats,
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.220]   each of whom had a lot of experience
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.600]   in measuring vaccine safety.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.720]   I was really surprised to hear them each doubt
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.840]   whether the FDA would do a reasonable job
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.760]   in assessing vaccine safety,
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.140]   including by people who have long records
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.760]   of working with the FDA.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.680]   I mean, these are professionals,
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:19.400]   great scientists, whose main goal in life
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.480]   is to make sure that unsafe vaccines
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.080]   don't get released into the world.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.400]   And if they are, they get pulled.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.520]   And they were casting doubt on the vaccine,
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.120]   the ability to track vaccine safety before the election.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.140]   And then after the election,
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:39.440]   the rhetoric switched on a dime, right?
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.640]   All of a sudden, it's Republicans that are cast
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.760]   as if they're vaccine-hesitant.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.800]   That kind of political shift, the public notices.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.420]   If all it takes is an election to change
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.400]   how people talk about the safety of the vaccine,
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.280]   well, we're not talking science anymore,
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.720]   many people think, right?
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.120]   I think that created its hesitancy.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.520]   The other thing I think,
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:05.920]   the hesitancy, some politicians viewed it
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.840]   as a political, as sort of like a political opportunity
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.200]   to sort of demonize people who are hesitant.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.840]   And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.640]   Like if you're telling me I'm a rube
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.920]   that just doesn't want the vaccine
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.880]   'cause I want everyone to die,
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.520]   well, I'm gonna react really negatively.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.560]   And if you're talking down to me
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.560]   about my legitimate sort of concerns
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.280]   about whether this vaccine's safe to take,
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.560]   I mean, I've heard from women
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.760]   who are thinking about getting pregnant,
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.320]   should I take the vaccine, I don't know.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.240]   I mean, there are all kinds of questions,
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.240]   legitimate questions that I think
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.900]   should have good data to answer
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.960]   that we don't necessarily have good data to answer.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.160]   So what do you do in the face of that?
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.960]   Well, one reaction is to pretend
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.480]   like we know for a fact that it's safe
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.680]   when we don't have the data to know for a fact
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.560]   in that particular group
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.880]   with that particular set of clinical circumstances you know.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.800]   And that I think breeds hesitancy.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.580]   People can detect that bullshit.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:09.320]   Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.680]   - Yeah, leave with humility.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.360]   - Yeah, you'll end up with a better result.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.920]   - Let me ask you about,
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.160]   I've recently had a conversation with a Pfizer CEO.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   This is part therapy session, part advice.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:29.520]   'Cause again, I really want us to get through this together
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.640]   and it feels like the division is a thing
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.280]   that prevents us from getting through this together.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.640]   And once again, just like with Francis Collins,
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.640]   a lot of people wrote to me words of support
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.200]   and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:53.120]   I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.520]   So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.960]   and those kinds of things.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.000]   That I have a better understanding of.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.540]   But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly,
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:16.560]   I'm trying to understand,
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.500]   am I so naive that I just don't see it?
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:26.400]   Because yes, there's corrupt people and they're greedy,
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.960]   they're flawed in all walks of life.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.800]   But companies do quite an incredible job
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.800]   of taking a good idea at the scale
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.600]   and making some money with that idea.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.880]   But they are the ones that achieve scale on a good idea.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.360]   It's not obvious to me,
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.800]   I don't see where the manipulation is.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.340]   So the fear that people have,
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:55.000]   and I talked to Joe about this quite a bit,
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.520]   I think this is a legitimate fear
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.320]   and a fear you should often have,
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.240]   that money has influence, disproportional influence,
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.920]   especially in politics.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.920]   So the fear is that the policy of the vaccine
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.760]   was connected to the fact that lots of money could be made
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.520]   by manufacturing the vaccine.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.320]   And I understand that.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.040]   And it's actually quite a heck of a difficult task
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.560]   to alleviate that concern.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.880]   Like you really have to be a great man or woman or leader
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.480]   to convince people that you're not full of shit,
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.720]   that you're not just playing a game on them.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.280]   I don't know, it's a difficult task.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280]   But at the same time,
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   I really don't like the natural distrust every billionaire,
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.160]   distrust everybody who's trying to make money.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.240]   Because it feels like, under a capitalistic system at least,
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.400]   the way to do a lot of good,
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.240]   like to do good at scale in the world
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.960]   is by being at least in part motivated by profit.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.360]   - I mean, I share your ambivalence, right?
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.920]   So on the one hand, you have a fantastic achievement,
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.720]   the discovery of the vaccine
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.880]   and then the manufacturing at scale,
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.680]   so that billions of people can take the vaccine
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.080]   in a relatively short time.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.240]   That is a remarkable achievement that could not have happened
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.960]   without companies like Pfizer.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.560]   And on the other hand,
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.780]   there is this sort of corrupting influence of that money.
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.400]   Just to give you one example,
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.280]   there's an enormous controversy over whether
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.800]   relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.720]   can be used to treat the disease.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:41.880]   No company like Pfizer has any interest whatsoever
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.040]   in evaluating it.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.520]   Even Merck, I think, what was Merck,
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:50.440]   that had the patent on ivermectin now expired,
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.480]   has no interest at all in checking to see if it works.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.680]   - Not only do they not have interest,
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.560]   they have a way of talking about people
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.560]   who might have a little bit of interest.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.680]   That's again-- - Fringe.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.360]   - Full of arrogance. - Yeah.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.620]   - And that is what troubles me.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.000]   It's back to the play of science.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.680]   They're not a bit of curiosity.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.760]   One, okay, one, the natural curiosity of a human being,
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.320]   they should always be there and an open-mindedness.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.680]   And second, in the case of ivermectin
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.240]   and other things like that,
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.380]   you have to acknowledge that there's a very large number
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:33.600]   of people who care about this topic
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.520]   and this is a way to inspire them
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.840]   to also play in the space of science,
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.840]   to inspire them with science.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.660]   You can't just dismiss everybody.
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:45.880]   You can't just dismiss people, period.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:48.360]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I think, here, take ivermectin.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.680]   There's actually a study funded by the NIH,
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.660]   by Tony Fauci's NIAID and the NIH,
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:00.660]   called ACTIV-6, that's a randomized trial of ivermectin.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:05.500]   It's due to be completed in March 2023.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:10.940]   So normally, when you have private actors
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.720]   like these big drug companies that have no interest
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.640]   in conducting some kind of scientific experiment
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.760]   that would have some public benefit,
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.880]   it's the job of the government,
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.520]   and in this case, the NIH, to fund that kind of work.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.680]   The NIH has been incredibly slow
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.920]   in its evaluations of these repurposed drugs
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.800]   and it's been left to lots of other private activities
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.120]   of uneven quality and hence,
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.240]   that's why you have these big fights.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.240]   Because the data are not solid,
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.960]   you're gonna have these big fights.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.120]   - Yeah, but also, okay, forget the process of science here,
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.600]   the studies, not enough effort being put into the studies,
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.220]   just the way it's being communicated.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.540]   - Yeah, no, like, horse-paced, I mean, come on.
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:01.820]   The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like,
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:03.460]   they're taking ivermectin because they've heard
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.740]   good things about it and they're sick
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.580]   and they're desperate, and to call it horse-paced
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.740]   was just, that was terrible.
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:11.220]   - That was deeply irresponsible.
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:14.560]   My hope is grounded in the fact that young people
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.780]   see the bullshit of this, young PhD students,
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.200]   graduate students, young students in college,
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:25.200]   they see the less-than-stellar way
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.660]   that our scientific leaders
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.380]   and our political leaders are behaving
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.340]   and then the new generation will not repeat the mistakes
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.140]   of the past, that is my hope.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:37.460]   'Cause that's the cool thing I see about young people
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:40.260]   is they're good at detecting bullshit
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.380]   and they don't wanna be part of that.
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:46.780]   That's my hope in the space of science.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.460]   Let me return to this idea
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.600]   of the Great Barrington Declaration,
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.680]   return to the beginning.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.760]   So what are the basics?
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.280]   Can you describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is?
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.640]   What are some of the ideas in it?
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.880]   You mentioned focused protection.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:04.440]   What are your concerns about lockdowns?
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.360]   Just paint the picture of this early proposal.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.240]   - Sure, so the Great Barrington Declaration,
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.320]   first, why is it called Great Barrington Declaration?
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.300]   - It's such a great name.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.820]   I mean, it's such an epic name,
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.880]   but the reason why it's called that is way less than epic.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.920]   - It was because the conference,
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.560]   which is organized by Martin Kulldorff,
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.800]   who was a professor at Harvard University,
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   biostatistician, he actually designed the safety system,
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.340]   the statistical system that the FDA uses
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.960]   for tracking vaccine safety.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:43.120]   He and I had met previously just the summer before,
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.460]   that summer, and he invited me to come
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.760]   to this small conference where he was inviting me
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.600]   and Sunetra Gupta, who is a professor
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.400]   of theoretical epidemiology at Harvard,
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.900]   sorry, at Oxford University.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.920]   And I mean, I jumped at the chance
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:01.040]   because I knew that Martin and Sunetra
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.280]   were both smarter than me, and it would be fun
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.280]   to talk about what the right strategy would be.
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.600]   On the drive in, I didn't know what the name
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.080]   of the town was, and I asked.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.600]   They said it was Great Barrington.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.040]   I had it in the back of my head.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.640]   Martin and I arrived a little early,
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.220]   and we were writing an op-ed about some of the ideas,
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.380]   I hope we'll get to talk about very soon,
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:25.460]   about focus protection and the right strategy.
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.200]   And when Sunetra arrived, we realized
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.180]   we'd actually come basically to the same place
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:33.000]   about the right way to deal with the epidemic.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.980]   And I thought, well, why don't we write something
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:39.300]   like the Port Huron Statement,
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.500]   is what I had in the back of my head.
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.620]   And I'm like, well, what's the name of this town again?
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.740]   It was Great Barrington.
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.980]   - Yeah, so it's not Barrington, it's Great Barrington.
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.080]   - Which is fantastic, right?
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.820]   - It's so over the top that it's perfect.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.780]   It's literally like the Big Bang.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.500]   There's something about these over-the-top,
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:01.140]   fun titles that just really deliver the power.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.500]   - That's my main contribution,
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.820]   was the title, the name Great Barrington.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:07.380]   But yeah, so it was kind of a,
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:12.080]   so the idea is actually, well, the title is great,
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.700]   and I think that it was written in a very stylish way.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.980]   Like it's less than a page,
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.740]   you can go look online and read it.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:21.820]   It's written for, not for scientists,
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.180]   but for the general public,
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.740]   so that people can understand the ideas really simply.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:29.500]   But it is not actually a radical set of ideas.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.820]   It actually represents the old pandemic plans
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:35.180]   that we've used for a century,
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.260]   dealing with other similar pandemics.
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:40.460]   And it's twofold.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:43.420]   First, let me talk about the science it rests on,
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:45.100]   and then I'll talk about the plan.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:45.940]   The science, actually,
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.700]   some of it we already talked about.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.640]   There's this massive age gradient
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.000]   in the risk of COVID infection.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.740]   Older people face much higher risk than younger people.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.420]   The second bit of science is all,
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.820]   that's not controversial, right?
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:02.020]   Even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2,
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.180]   no matter what, everyone agrees on this age gradient.
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:09.300]   The second bit of science is also not controversial.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.380]   The lockdown-focused policies that we followed
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.380]   have absolutely devastating consequences
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.600]   on the health of the population.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.980]   Let me just give you some examples.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.700]   And this was known in October of 2020 when we wrote it.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.060]   So the UN was sounding alarms
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.940]   that there would be tens of millions of people
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.120]   who would starve as a consequence
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.420]   of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.740]   And that's come to pass.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.820]   Hundreds of thousands of children
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.420]   in places like South Asia dead from starvation
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.840]   as a consequence of lockdowns.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:53.860]   The priorities like the treatment of patients
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:57.900]   with tuberculosis in poor countries
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.640]   stopped because of lockdowns.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.700]   Childhood vaccination of measles, mumps, rubella,
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:09.380]   DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus,
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:13.300]   all those standard vaccination campaigns stopped.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.820]   Tens of millions of children skipping these doses
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:19.420]   for diseases that are actually deadly for them.
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:23.540]   - Is there, just on a small tangent,
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.700]   is it well understood to you,
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:28.100]   what are the mechanisms that stop all those things
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.260]   because of lockdowns?
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:31.300]   Is it some aspect of supply chains?
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:35.140]   Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed?
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:38.620]   Is it because there's a disincentive to go outside
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.100]   by people even when they deeply need help?
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.660]   - It's all of the above.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.340]   But a lot of those efforts,
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:45.860]   like especially those vaccination efforts,
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.900]   are funded and run by Western efforts.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.420]   Like Gavi is a, I think it's a Gates-funded thing actually,
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.180]   that provides vaccines for millions of kids worldwide.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:01.220]   And those efforts were scaled back.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:02.900]   Malaria prevention efforts.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.780]   So in the developing world,
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:08.220]   it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.300]   There was also direct effects.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:13.420]   Like in India, the lockdowns, when they first instituted,
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:17.340]   there was an order that 10 million migrant workers
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.180]   who live in big cities, and they live hand to mouth,
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.140]   they buy coconuts, they sell the coconuts.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.980]   With the money, they buy food for themselves
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:26.980]   and coconuts for the next day to sell,
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:32.620]   walk back to their villages or go back to their villages
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.580]   overnight.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.900]   So 10 million people walking back to their villages
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.900]   or taking a train back.
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.100]   A thousand died en route.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.620]   Overcrowded trains, dying essentially on the side
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:42.460]   of the road.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.700]   I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:48.820]   And the lockdowns there,
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:52.420]   it's actually, it's kind of like what's happened
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:55.380]   in the West as well, but it was so severe.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.540]   There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.180]   by a friend of mine at the University of Chicago.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.500]   What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai,
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:08.500]   there were 70% seroprevalence in July or August of 2020,
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.340]   whereas in the rest of Mumbai, it was 20%.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.300]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.740]   So it was incredibly unequal.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:17.660]   The lockdowns protected the relatively well off
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.700]   and spread the disease among the poor.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.500]   So that's in the developing world.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.900]   In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.100]   were also quite bad, right?
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.160]   So we've talked already about isolation and depression.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.660]   There was a study done in July of 2020
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.180]   that found that one in four young adults
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.440]   seriously considered suicide.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.940]   Now, suicide rates haven't spiked up so much,
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.420]   but the depths of despair that would lead somebody
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.420]   to seriously consider suicide itself
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:57.820]   should be a source of great concern in public health.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.100]   - Yeah, this is one of the troubling things
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.780]   about measuring wellbeing is we're okay
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.220]   at measuring death and suicide.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:09.020]   We're not so good at measuring suffering.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:14.020]   It's like people talk about maybe even Holodomor
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:19.460]   in under Stalin or the concentration camps with Hitler.
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:23.940]   We talk about deaths, but we don't talk about the suffering
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.740]   over periods of years by people living in fear,
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.980]   by people starving, psychological trauma
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:33.900]   that lasts a lifetime, all of those things.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.460]   - I mean, and just to get back to that point,
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.540]   we closed schools, especially in blue states,
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:40.120]   we closed schools.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.300]   Now, richer parents could send their kids
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.100]   to private schools, many of which stayed open
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:45.080]   even in the blue states.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.060]   They could get pods, they could get tutors,
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:50.580]   but that's not true for poor and middle-class parents.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:54.540]   And as a result, what we did is we took away
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.060]   life opportunities for kids.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:59.420]   We tried to teach five-year-olds to read via Zoom
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:01.740]   in kindergarten, right?
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.240]   And the consequence actually, you think, okay,
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.260]   we can just make it up, but it's really difficult
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.020]   to make that up.
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.840]   There's a literature in health economics
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.740]   that shows that even relatively small disruptions
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.260]   in schooling can have lifelong consequences,
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.500]   negative consequences for kids, right?
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.380]   So they end up growing up poorer,
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.860]   they lead shorter lives and less healthy lives
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.620]   as a consequence, and that's what the literature now shows
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.940]   is likely to happen with the interruptions of schooling
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.700]   that we had in the United States.
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.160]   Many European countries actually managed to avoid this.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.860]   There were, in the early days of the epidemic,
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.260]   great indications that children, first,
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:46.660]   were not very severely at risk from COVID itself,
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.120]   nor are they super spreaders.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.620]   Schools were not the source of community spread,
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.860]   community spread spread the disease to schools,
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.100]   not the other way around.
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:59.300]   And if we can talk about the scientific base of that
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.720]   if you'd like, but that was pretty well known
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.780]   even in October.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:06.660]   We closed hospitals in order to keep them
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:10.980]   available to COVID patients, but as a result,
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:14.140]   women skipped breast cancer screening.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:16.980]   As a result, they are showing up with late-stage
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:19.680]   breast cancer that should have been picked up last year.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.900]   Men and women skipped colon cancer screening,
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:24.200]   again, with later-stage disease that should have been
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.200]   picked up last year with earlier stage.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.840]   For patients with diabetes, it's very important
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.200]   to have regular screening for blood sugar levels
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:36.760]   and sort of counseling for lifestyle improvement,
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.160]   and we skipped that.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.720]   People stayed home with heart attacks
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.540]   and died at home with heart attacks.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:47.400]   So you had this sort of wide range of medical
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.920]   and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.000]   as a result of the lockdowns.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.900]   - Plus there's the economic pain.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.440]   So like you said, whatever is a good term
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:05.040]   for the non-laptop class, people would lose their jobs.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.200]   Yes, there might be in the Western world
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:11.440]   support for them financially, but the big loss there
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.360]   that is perhaps correlated with the depression
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   and suicide is loss of meaning, loss of hope for the future,
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.000]   loss of kind of a sense of stability,
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   all the pride you have in being able to make money
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.800]   that allows you to pave your own way in the world,
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.600]   and yes, just having less money than you're used to,
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.520]   so your family, your kids are suffering,
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.120]   all those kinds of things.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.320]   - There's again an economics literature on this,
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.600]   on deaths of despair it was called.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.920]   2009, there was the Great Recession,
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:50.840]   it led to an enormous uptick in overdose from drugs,
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.080]   suicidality, depression, as a result of the job losses
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.560]   that happened during the Great Recession.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.160]   Well, that's happening again,
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.700]   like an enormous increase in drug overdoses.
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:07.920]   That's not an accident, that's a lockdown harm, right?
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.480]   Same thing with the job losses.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.920]   The job losses, by the way, it's so interesting
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.640]   because the states that stayed open
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.440]   have had much, much lower unemployment
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.740]   than the states that stayed closed.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.520]   The labor force participation rates declined by 3%,
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.440]   it's women that separated
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.540]   because they stayed home with their kids.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:31.440]   We've reversed a generation of women,
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:37.120]   improving women's participation in the labor force.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.140]   - Do you think it has to do with institutions
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:44.480]   that we mentioned that there was so much priority given
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:48.240]   or so much power given to maybe NIH
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.680]   versus other civilian leaders,
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.420]   or do people just not care about the economic pain?
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:59.380]   The leaders, I mean, 'cause to me it was obvious.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:03.520]   I mean, probably it's just studying history.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:06.560]   Whenever I listen to people on Twitter,
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.820]   on mainstream news, or just anything,
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:14.380]   I realize that's the very kind of top.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.240]   The people that have a voice
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.640]   represent a tiny selection of people,
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.760]   and so whenever there's hard times,
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.760]   I always kind of think about the quiet, the voiceless,
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.000]   the quiet suffering of the tens of millions,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.400]   of the hundreds of millions.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.400]   Do political leaders not just give a damn?
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.560]   - I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.280]   at the beginning of the pandemic,
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.320]   where if you brought up economic harms at all,
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.980]   you were seen as callous.
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:50.080]   Right, so I had a reporter call me up
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.600]   almost at the very beginning of the epidemic
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.600]   asking me about a very particular phenomenon.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:00.680]   So he was anticipating a rise in child abuse
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.320]   because children were gonna be staying at home,
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:05.000]   child abuse is generally picked up at school.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.080]   And that actually happened.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.520]   So the report of child abuse dropped,
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.420]   but actual child abuse increased.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:14.120]   'Cause normally you pick up the child abuse at school
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.120]   and then you have the intervention, right?
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.880]   So yeah, so I was talking about,
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.120]   well, there's gonna be some economic harms
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.200]   and they're gonna have health consequences,
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.760]   but the economic harms matter.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   But he counseled me, and I think he had my best interest
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.520]   at heart, like if we were to put that in the story,
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.760]   I would be, I'd essentially be canceled.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.360]   'Cause what the narrative that arose in March of 2020
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.740]   is if you care about money at all,
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:43.760]   you're evil and crass, you must only care about lives.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.360]   The problem with that narrative is that that money,
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.280]   which we're talking about, is actually lives of poor people.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.680]   Right, when you throw 100 million people around the world
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.100]   into poverty, you're going to see enormous harm
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.300]   to their health, enormous increases in mortality.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:05.000]   It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.320]   in the context of this pandemic response.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.040]   Our mind focused so much on COVID that it forgot
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.160]   that there are so many other public health priorities
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.500]   as well that need our attention desperately.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:21.240]   - And this is the thing I sensed about San Francisco
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.600]   when I visited, I was thinking of moving there for a startup.
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.580]   This is the thing I'm really afraid of,
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:30.400]   especially if I have any effect on the world
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.300]   through a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.980]   That you mentioned the laptop class,
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:40.280]   living in this world where you're only concerned
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.400]   about this particular class of people.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:48.920]   And also, perhaps early on in the pandemic,
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.480]   amongst the laptop class, there was a legitimate concern
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.960]   for health, like you're not sure how deadly this virus is.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.260]   You're not sure who to listen to,
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.900]   so there's a real concern.
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:02.060]   And then at a certain point when the data starts coming in,
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:05.120]   you start becoming more and more detached from the data.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.280]   You start caring less and less,
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.740]   and you start just swimming in the space of narratives,
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:12.420]   like existing in the space of narratives.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:15.420]   And you have this narrative in San Francisco
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:19.660]   in the laptop class that you just are very proud
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:22.360]   that you know the truth, you're the sole possessors
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.140]   of the truth, you congratulate yourself on it,
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:28.040]   and you don't care what actually gigantic,
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.820]   detrimental effect it has on society,
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.100]   'cause you're mostly fine.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:36.860]   I'm so terrified of that.
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.740]   - Well, I think the antidote to that is just to remember.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.580]   - You remember.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:41.900]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.020]   - I don't think, you know, remember where you came from,
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.380]   and remember who you're doing this for.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.980]   At the back of your head should always be,
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:49.520]   what's the purpose?
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.780]   Like, why am I here?
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.740]   What's the purpose of this?
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.540]   If the purpose is simply self-aggrandizement,
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:57.660]   then you should rethink,
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.960]   'cause it'll just end up being a hollow life.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.220]   - All of us will be forgotten in the end.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:08.580]   Focus protection, the idea, the policy,
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:09.980]   what is focus protection?
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:13.140]   - Right, so I was saying that there's two scientific bases.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.180]   So one is this steep age gradient,
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.100]   and the second is the existence of locked arms.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.260]   Again, I think there's very little disagreement,
