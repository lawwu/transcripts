[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.480]   What happens when you don't pay your taxes?
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.280]   I mean, you can go to jail,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.440]   but like if you don't pay them for like,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400]   if you don't pay enough taxes,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.320]   you get a penalty, like a fine.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.400]   They also kind of can charge interest, right?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.480]   So I'm actually not a tax professional.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.800]   I'm actually like not that good at taxes,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.880]   but I am good at seeing a great investment opportunity
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.240]   and here is one I've got for you.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.520]   What if I told you,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   you could not pay taxes on some of your money
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.080]   and literally not pay those taxes for decades
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.400]   and not only will you not pay a penalty,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.440]   you will also not be charged interest.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.640]   It's like an interest-free loan from the federal government.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.720]   When's it due?
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   I don't know.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.120]   Sometime in your distant, distant future.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   Sounds like a really sexy, sexy idea, right?
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.880]   Exciting.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560]   Do y'all wanna hear what this is?
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.880]   I'm gonna give it to you.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.080]   A 401k.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.600]   What?
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.560]   Yes, it's called a 401k.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.400]   That's what's happening.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.500]   You put a dollar in there,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.520]   you don't pay taxes on that dollar
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.560]   and then you pay back your taxes decades later.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.120]   No penalty.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.600]   So you're using the government's money.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.720]   That money would have come out of your pocket.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.440]   So it's in your pocket now.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.720]   You get to invest that in stocks and bonds
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480]   and then you pay it back later.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.440]   Whoa.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.860]   So we have this thing,
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.800]   this deferred taxation bucket
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.500]   and the guy that created this bucket
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.440]   literally names it after a line in the tax code
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.620]   and we wonder why these things are not more popular.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.860]   So what we're gonna do today
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.320]   is we're gonna get super excited about these buckets
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.980]   because here's what's going on.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.520]   I told you already,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.680]   we gotta figure out how much to save for our future, right?
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   We've got to.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.320]   This is kind of a non-negotiable.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.340]   We've got to get our savings rate right
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.140]   but where people get hung up
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.120]   is they don't know where to put that money.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.700]   So that's what we're gonna do here
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.060]   is we are going to do the tax-efficient waterfall
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.700]   and figure out exactly,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.300]   once you have that pile of money figured out,
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.880]   allocate it to the different buckets
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   that are gonna give you the most bang for your bucket.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.500]   Okay, here it is.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   So we're gonna go one by one through each of these.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.220]   So if you remember the previous example
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.220]   where we, I think, had to put aside $22,500,
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.060]   I think was our amount.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.780]   You've done your calculation.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.440]   You take your gross pay, you multiply it,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.300]   in your case, by 5%.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.260]   Maybe yours is 10%, maybe yours is 20%.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.940]   So just take your calculator out
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.320]   and then do the math and there's your dollar amount
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.500]   that you need to allocate to your different buckets.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.480]   And here's what I've done for you.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.700]   I've just prioritized your buckets, okay?
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.860]   So for the most part, they are prioritized
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.060]   by how much tax efficiency
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.900]   that I just described to you, the phenomenon,
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.820]   why tax efficiency is such a big deal.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.980]   But there's also a few other elements that are at play.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.060]   So Kyle here asked me a great question at the break.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.780]   Raise your hand, Kyle.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.020]   And he said something I kind of overlooked.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.260]   He said, what if I have a retirement plan
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.820]   and they match into my retirement plan?
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.820]   Does the company's dollars factor into my savings rate?
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.860]   So let's say you have 100% match up to 5%.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.380]   You put in 5%, the company puts in 5%.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.980]   Does that mean you're saving 10?
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.620]   And the answer is actually not in my equation.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.300]   In my equation, it is only factoring in
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.660]   how much you are putting in.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.460]   Because there's two important things
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.300]   happening when you save.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.220]   First of all, you're actually putting physical dollars
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.700]   for your future.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.500]   But actually more importantly,
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.820]   you're lowering your lifestyle by that amount.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.340]   Your ability to stop working on your own terms one day
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.980]   is can you keep your lifestyle going, right?
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.460]   And so if you're bringing down your lifestyle,
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.740]   then the chances are higher that the amount of money
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.540]   you have is going to last longer
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.040]   funding the lifestyle that you have.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.540]   So that's why I do not include a company match
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.320]   in that percentage.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.640]   Now there are exceptions.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.100]   I mean, there are some pretty crazy matches out there,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.100]   in which case you can maybe put some of that
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.620]   into your savings rate.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.580]   But for the most part, I say just make that gravy.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.520]   Make it gravy.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.700]   Also, do y'all know what vesting is?
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.820]   I mean, a lot of people leave their jobs after two years.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.540]   And many of these employer plans,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.700]   you're not even vested for six years.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.240]   So whatever the company is putting in,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.060]   you don't even take it anyway.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.620]   So company employer matches are really tricky.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.300]   And so I say go for them,
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.220]   but don't include them
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.660]   in your core savings rate calculation.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.780]   Okay, so what we're gonna do
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.660]   is we're gonna go through these buckets.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.260]   Do y'all understand what I'm saying here?
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.260]   When we are allocating your pile of money
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.580]   into a hierarchy of where you're gonna get
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.580]   the most advantages to that money,
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.360]   not talking about investments themselves,
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.140]   but the actual structure of the bucket.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.340]   Are we all on the same page here?
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.100]   Okay, let's go through the buckets.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.020]   This is a resource slide so you can know
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.540]   if you're making these calculations,
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.740]   if you wanna work on it over the course of this weekend.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.100]   I'll be around if you wanna have me look at 'em.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.220]   This can kinda help you figure out
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.400]   how much can go into your buckets.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.420]   Okay, so we wanna start with our first bucket,
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.820]   which is get your free money.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.540]   Always go get your free money.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.720]   So if the company is matching 100% up to 5%,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.820]   get your free money, right?
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.500]   So at least put 5% of your money into that bucket.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   We've seen some organizations that match 100% up to 10%.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.820]   Some people put all of their money in this first bucket.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.180]   How convenient, right?
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.020]   That's really setting people up for success,
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.700]   being able to do that.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.540]   So always prioritize the buckets
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.080]   where you can get free money.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.340]   That's usually gonna be in a 401(k), a 403(b),
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.020]   or if you work for a governmental entity, a 457 plan.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.180]   They all work essentially the same way.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.780]   Okay, now let's pay off that student loan debt.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.540]   If you work in public service and you have student loans,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.920]   you should be writing a check for whatever amount
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.360]   the government tells you to write.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.300]   We have had doctors who just kinda forget about this
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.980]   and they're like, oh, it's a low-interest student loan debt
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.820]   and then I go and see that they've got $300,000
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.180]   in student loan debt.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.300]   They've been working for a hospital for 15 years
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.460]   and we go get $300,000 forgiven.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.860]   They would have just kept on paying,
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.220]   kept on paying, kept on paying.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.740]   So if you work in public service,
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.620]   so if you work for a governmental entity
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.260]   or you work for a non-profit hospital or non-profit,
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.220]   whatever your payment is, your next priority
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.220]   is to make that payment so that your loans get forgiven.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.540]   If you are not working for a non-profit entity
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.440]   and you have high-interest debt, credit card debt,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.020]   again, a lot of student loan debt,
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.740]   I mean, there's some parent plus loans out there
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.840]   that are 9% plus, right?
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.340]   Let's just pay those things off.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.340]   If I said to you, I have an investment
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.100]   and it's gonna have a 9% guaranteed rate of return
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.340]   after tax, would you believe me?
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.340]   No, but this is literally like
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.380]   a government-guaranteed rate of return
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.460]   if you pay off that debt.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.540]   So let's pay that debt off, right?
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.180]   It's amazing to me the number of people
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.620]   who both carry credit card debt
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.340]   that'll have 25% interest
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.620]   and aggressively save into a retirement plan, right?
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.420]   So let's pay off this debt.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.960]   Now, you might think the next bucket
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.980]   would be to go back to finish out
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.180]   what's left in your retirement plan
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.380]   'cause you can put up to $23,000 into a retirement plan,
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.520]   more if you're over 50, but no,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.980]   the next best retirement plan
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.460]   might be your health savings account.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.820]   So if you have a high-deductible healthcare plan
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.500]   and it comes with an HSA,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.060]   not to be confused with an FSA,
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.100]   a flexible spending account,
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.580]   if you have an HSA-eligible high-deductible healthcare plan
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.260]   and that was the best healthcare plan for you to choose
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.700]   that made the most sense to you,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.900]   then I urge you to consider
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.580]   that this is one of your best retirement accounts
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.880]   that you will ever have.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.940]   So about 10 or 12 years ago,
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.400]   I saw these things come down
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.860]   because my husband and I couldn't afford health insurance.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.340]   We both had small businesses.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.140]   And so we heard about this thing called an HSA.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.900]   And I was looking at that going,
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.940]   wait a minute, I can open this thing
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.360]   and I can invest it in stocks and bonds
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.940]   and I never have to spend it?
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.280]   What's the catch here?
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.900]   So we started doing that
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.140]   and we have a sizable amount in this account
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.600]   because you can simply save into the maximum,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.180]   invest it in stocks and bonds,
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.180]   and as long as you use it for health expenses,
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.540]   you will owe no taxes.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.220]   Now, if you know the way an HSA works,
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.060]   it's very similar to an FSA.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.980]   You put money in and you get an immediate tax deduction.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.480]   So think about what's happening here.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.660]   You don't pay taxes on the way in.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.240]   As long as you spend your money on health expenses,
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.460]   you don't pay taxes on the back end.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.900]   If you grow the money in stocks and bonds,
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.020]   you don't pay any taxes.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.980]   You don't pay capital gains taxes.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.700]   You don't pay taxes on the dividends or the interest.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.540]   It's literally the only money
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.340]   that you will never pay taxes on
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.380]   aside from like your babysitting money in high school.
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.140]   This is an incredible opportunity.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.900]   And some people say,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.240]   "Well, what if I don't have health expenses in retirement?"
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.180]   Hmm, I wonder if you won't have
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.820]   any health expenses in retirement.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.620]   Sounds like a great problem to have.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.500]   You can use it, we call it like a little stealth IRA.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.060]   So you can essentially take the money out
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.820]   if you're not using it for health expenses
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.900]   after the age of 60,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.980]   and you pay taxes on it just the way you would
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.940]   like a 401(k) or a 403(b).
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.220]   So you just, whatever you take out,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.740]   you pay income taxes on that amount.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.460]   It is an incredible opportunity to save for retirement.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.940]   So then the next bucket, going down the ladder,
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.940]   is you max out into your retirement plans.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.060]   And there are some people that have the opportunity
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.580]   to invest in two retirement plans.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.740]   Like some people who work for hospitals, for instance,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.300]   might have access to both a 403(b) and a 457,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.960]   which essentially doubles the federal maximum
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.220]   for how much you can save.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.940]   It is a great opportunity to save.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.940]   What I love about, especially these retirement plans,
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.220]   is that they are so easy to use
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.160]   that people are more likely to save.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.820]   So I am always, I believe simple beats complex
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.220]   every single time.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.140]   And you literally have a human
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.740]   that's standing in front of you saying,
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.380]   "How much would you like to put into this account?
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.140]   "How much would you like to put in this account?"
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.220]   And then it's done.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.160]   And usually, even if you don't choose the investments,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.580]   you are defaulted into, typically now,
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.100]   especially larger plans, a target date retirement fund.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.180]   And just like Rick was talking about,
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.000]   I mean, I run retirement plans,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.420]   and I think one of the more common retirement plan lineups
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.860]   is now Vanguard, right?
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.540]   The Vanguard or Fidelity,
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.100]   passive target retirement date funds.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.960]   So if you choose nothing,
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   you will be put into a pretty appropriate investment.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.620]   In like five minutes, you could have this done.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.860]   It's pretty easy, right?
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:45.020]   Next, you can max out IRA, Roth IRA,
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:50.020]   if you're over the income limit,
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.300]   you could do a backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.780]   These are accounts you can just set up on your own.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.380]   It has never been easier to open up your own IRA,
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.900]   Roth IRA, go to the federal maximum.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.920]   And literally, you can automate these contributions
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.980]   into these buckets.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.580]   And then, typically, as long as you're using mutual funds,
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.860]   you can set it to auto-purchase.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.460]   It is a really incredible, it's like setting up your own,
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.500]   you know, it's like simulating what's happening at work.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.160]   You're just, you know, signing up for this thing.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.820]   You're automating the contributions,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.060]   you're automating the investments.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.280]   It becomes just as easy as your work retirement plans.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.740]   And then, what's interesting is a lot of people,
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.140]   this is the last bucket.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.980]   So, and especially for higher earners,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.300]   this is the point at which you end up
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.260]   with the taxable brokerage account.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.340]   Now, a lot of folks are really scared, for some reason,
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.700]   about setting up a taxable brokerage account.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.900]   But again, it has never been easier
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.800]   to open a Vanguard Fidelity Schwab account,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.260]   just a regular old account.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.660]   And you can set your, you know,
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.140]   if you get paid on the eighth of every month,
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.080]   you can have $500, $1,000 just auto-transferred
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.900]   into this bucket, into this account.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.980]   Purchase your three-fund portfolio
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.620]   that we've been discussing today.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.060]   And it is that easy.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.220]   Rebalance maybe once a year.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.060]   Don't be afraid to go to this bucket.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.000]   This is a great bucket, y'all.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So, a lot of times what I see is people will tell me,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.040]   like I was speaking to a doctor actually just yesterday.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.560]   He was like, "Oh, I max everything out.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.800]   "I max everything out."
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.880]   Okay, so he maxes his 403(b) and his 457.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.920]   I can tell you, I don't know his personal details,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.160]   I don't know his income,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.720]   but I can tell you he's under-saving.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.000]   So, it sounds great, right?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.020]   I'm maxing out, I'm maxing out.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.520]   But if those are the only two accounts he has,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.280]   I can do some pretty quick math to know
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.400]   we're not ready for retirement.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.640]   And so, that's why we can't be afraid
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.080]   of this taxable brokerage account,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.480]   especially if you're a high earner.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.380]   You've gotta get here.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.020]   And I'm just telling you,
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.800]   it is not nearly as scary as you think.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.440]   Now, a lot of people ask, where does crypto fit in, right?
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.000]   I like really have to scratch that itch, okay?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.920]   And I say don't, but then if you're gonna do it,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.920]   do it this way.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   If you have gotten your savings rate
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.320]   into those prior buckets,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.480]   and you just really hate spending money
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.640]   on yourself in the present,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.800]   like my husband hates it, like it physically pains him.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.360]   So then, if that's the case,
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.660]   you know, you've got some extra money,
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.940]   this is where it can go.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.320]   Venture capital, angel investing.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   A friend just invested in a sister's brother-in-law's
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.760]   barbecue joint, I don't know.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.040]   Cattle ranch, we love cattle ranches, right?
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.360]   Like, we think we're Yellowstone Cowboys.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.540]   Go buy one with your extra money.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.980]   Don't come, oh, don't, okay, don't go to Montana.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.360]   Do, are a lot of people trying to move to Montana
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.660]   after that show?
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:25.640]   And I know how they do justice over there.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.360]   Okay, hey, come to Arkansas, everyone.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.400]   Come to Arkansas.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.740]   We've got five direct flights, folks.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:42.840]   Okay, and then, if you've got, you know,
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.200]   one of those low-interest mortgages,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.520]   pay off your house, that's fine.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.360]   Just pay it off, that's okay.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.040]   But don't make your house the first thing you pay off.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.800]   This is where I'm gonna talk to the women a second.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.600]   We're just gonna sidebar over here.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.120]   We really, really, really feel like we need
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   to have perfect information.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.960]   I get that.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.320]   We have to be sure of things.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.840]   And all those other buckets feel very uncertain.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.480]   So a lot of us say, well, I'll just pay off my house.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.560]   Oh, there's a high-yield savings account.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.780]   I'll put it all there.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.080]   Ladies, we have to take risk.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.560]   We have to.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.220]   This is where we have to trust in the bucket system.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.760]   I want you to put that money in the bucket system.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.320]   You can default yourself into one of those
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   target date funds, and you can look at it once a year,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.720]   but I want you to do it.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.000]   I want you to do it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   Pay off the house after all of this is done.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.580]   Okay, so, I have a question.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.160]   What is our first bucket?
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.480]   Match, very good.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.880]   Kyle, good job.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.180]   Kyle, you're gonna get a copy of my book, well done.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.020]   Well done.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.420]   I did like the pay yourself first.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.380]   That is my favorite thing to say.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.580]   So I think we're actually a little ahead of time.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.800]   That's okay?
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.140]   No, we're done.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.060]   (faintly speaking)
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.120]   you
