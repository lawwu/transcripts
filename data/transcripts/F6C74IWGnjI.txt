[00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.600]   All right, I'm going to go ahead and jump right in.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.480]   There's a couple of things, and we gave--
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.720]   just a couple of things I want to say by way of opening.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.320]   Some of you got a pamphlet called the Master's Fellowship.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.920]   And there is a booth out in front of the sanctuary
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.120]   where we have Brett Zamross and Todd Fletcher.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.540]   Brett and Todd, are you somewhere
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.000]   in the neighborhood like right here?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.240]   These guys are teammates in the Fellowship Administrator
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.120]   and Regional Leader Director.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.680]   The fellowship is for guys like us, guys in ministry,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.440]   guys who are serving in leadership
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.000]   function in a local church, guys that
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600]   would come to Shepherds Conference and leave going,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.000]   man, that was one of the best weeks of my life.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.160]   Guys who have common convictions about the things that
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.720]   matter, the Word of God, the Son of God, the way you do church,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.240]   the way you preach the Word of God.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.300]   Guys like us need guys like us.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.320]   And so not just once a year in a fellowship setting like this,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.800]   but the Master's Fellowship is men
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   who share convictions that are common and affections that
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.240]   are common-- love for God, love for His Word,
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.980]   love for His people.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.920]   And the fellowship is designed for you
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.480]   to have relationships with guys like you.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.020]   So the fellowship is populated by men
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.240]   who say by application, the mastersfellowship.org--
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.200]   it's on the brochure.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.960]   You can just find it, Google it.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.560]   You apply, and you apply because you're
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   going to answer some questions and important questions
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520]   about what you believe and about your convictions about how
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.360]   to do ministry and your convictions about the person
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   and work of Jesus Christ, the Word of God, its authority,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.680]   inspiration, et cetera, things you would expect.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.040]   Because what we're after is guys like us having benefit
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.560]   from other guys like us.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.920]   Because here's the bottom line.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.240]   Brothers need brothers.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.720]   Pastors need pastors.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.880]   Leaders need other leaders to the end
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.560]   that we maximize our potential for the glory of God.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.280]   Guys like us don't always fulfill our potential
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640]   because we're isolated and alone.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.440]   And we're going to need each other.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.240]   You may not need someone today, but you're
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.840]   going to need each other.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.160]   And as the culture continues to spiral and erode,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.000]   you're going to need spaces and places
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   where you can be encouraged.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.280]   We meet online once a month.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.440]   We'll lead a Zoom call.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.920]   Dr. MacArthur's with us once a month, typically.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   And then we have a monthly Zoom call, not his, but another one
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   that we will do around some subject--
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.600]   pastoral, theological, practical--
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.760]   so that it's meant to help you, give you a chance to Q&A.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.440]   And we have some questions.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.440]   And I wanted to make you aware of it because, as a pastor,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   I'm convinced that we need each other
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440]   and we'll be better together.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.600]   And as the culture journeys forward,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   you're going to need relationships.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.840]   The Master's Fellowship-- and I would call it its genius
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.160]   and not meant to elevate anything.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.120]   But the genius of it is its regional leadership,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.640]   its regional gatherings.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   It's fine to Zoom.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   It's great to come to Shepherd's Conference.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.200]   But this is not accessible to you all year long.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.160]   You need spaces and places and brothers
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.120]   that you can access--
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.940]   regular fellowship.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.360]   And that's what the fellowship is.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.280]   So when you see the Master's Fellowship,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   you're really seeing guys like us
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.000]   who want to gather with guys like us
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.320]   to become what God wants us to be individually
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.280]   and collectively.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   So I want you to know about that.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.560]   You don't have to have a brochure to find us.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.480]   Just the mastersfellowship.org.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.160]   Or we're at the booth out in front of the sanctuary.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.800]   As you go in, we're to the right,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.200]   right next to Grace Advance.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.440]   That's not a commercial.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's really meant as information.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.500]   So if you want to be a part of that,
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.720]   you're more than welcome.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.040]   All right, 1 Peter chapter 3--
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.560]   where you expected me to go today.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.800]   This is an assigned subject.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.640]   It is a very important subject.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.240]   Obviously, you're standing here.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   It's important.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.600]   Some of you are sitting here.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.920]   You understand the high priority of your relationship
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.600]   with your wife and how, according to the Bible,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.400]   it affects your relationship with God.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.920]   I teach a seminary class across the hall weekly.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.600]   And I say to the men who are part
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   of the practice of pastoral ministry,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.620]   this is how I start each semester.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.800]   You fail at home, you fail.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.400]   I don't care how many books you write,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.160]   how many blog posts you have, how many conventions
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.880]   or conferences you speak at, how many people know your name.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.640]   Your first ministry, job one, is at home.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's why 1 Timothy 3 looks like it does
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.800]   and Titus 1 looks like it does because of the credentials
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.900]   that qualify you for credible biblical ministry, which
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.040]   is the model of a true Christian.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.600]   It's the qualification of elders.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.560]   But elders are not super saints.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.240]   They're just model followers of Christ.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.960]   This is what you should look like and aim at for every man.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.480]   So job one, and that's what I've kind of subtitled this,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.320]   or maybe titled it and put under it,
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.280]   so that your prayers may not be hindered.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.520]   And I didn't pick that title.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.760]   That was picked for me.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.440]   Put in your program.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.480]   And obviously, your wife saw it, and here you are.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.280]   So if they'd have seen job one, you wouldn't be here.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.320]   But this is that.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.400]   This is the high priority of relating well and biblically
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.520]   with your wife.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.960]   And here's the obvious connected thought.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.520]   Because you need God in everything you do,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.000]   when God says that your relationship with her
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.400]   will help or hinder your connection with him,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   you could say, you fail at home.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.280]   You really will fail.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.400]   Because without me, you can do nothing, Jesus said.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.200]   Everything of eternal importance happens because of prayer.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.960]   Not your hard work, but by the work of God,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.880]   because you are desperately dependent upon him.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.440]   And so I feel like I'm convincing you of something
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.560]   you're already convinced of.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.480]   The passage that we're going to look at, one verse,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.120]   and then I'm going to try to unpack it for your benefit
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.440]   in terms of its implications.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.560]   And it is thick with principle and practice.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:42.360]   Verse 7, 1 Peter 3, "You husbands, likewise,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   live with your wives in an understanding way,
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.840]   as with a weaker vessel, since she is a woman.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.640]   And grant her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.800]   so that your prayers may not be hindered."
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.560]   Now, the word hindered means totally cut off.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.720]   There's a big wreck on I-5.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.080]   The black and whites are in the roadway.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.400]   The lights are on, and nobody's passing.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   There's a wreck.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.760]   There's an obstacle.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.200]   That's this word.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.880]   It's not hindered like it's hard.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.160]   It's not hindered like somebody's holding you back.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   It's hindered like you're blocked off.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.200]   Paul said, I wanted to go, and I couldn't go.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.720]   I was prevented.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   It is an absolute block between you and God.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.960]   That's sobering.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.480]   And that is the consequence, the result clause in this verse
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.680]   is, so that doesn't happen to you,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.360]   so that you are not cut off from the blessing and benefit
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.840]   and access of the living God that
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.800]   has impact in your life, your family, and your ministry.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.720]   That's why this is so important, let alone its impact
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.120]   on the wife you made promises to.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.360]   This is impactful to everything in your life that
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.800]   matters, because prayer affects everything in your life.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.320]   Notice the word, verse 7, likewise.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.600]   Likewise introduces us to the fact
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.280]   that this is a connection to what he's already said.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.960]   Just like who?
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.040]   Well, verse 1 of chapter 3 says, in the same way you wives.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.920]   So you have wives, 1 through 6.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.720]   Aren't you glad she has six verses and you only have one?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.240]   What he just said to her, likewise,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.600]   as it relates to the main verbal idea, you are to apply.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.760]   And because it says, in the same way,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.040]   this is informed by the context which precedes that.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.360]   So I want to start with this big thought for you.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.820]   And the idea that I'd like to offer to you
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:24.000]   is that if you want to be God-honoring, gospel-validating,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.120]   and someone who enjoys God's blessing,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.680]   you need to be this kind of husband.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:37.560]   God-honoring, gospel-validating, and enjoying God's blessing,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.040]   you need to be this kind of husband.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.980]   Why would I say that?
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.880]   Because likewise connects to the whole context.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.280]   And I'm going to track you back to that here in a minute.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.880]   But the benefit of what you're about to hear
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.640]   is in recognition that this is connected.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.000]   1 Peter is written to encourage you to stand firm.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.480]   It is also written to tell you to stand out.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   He's writing to encourage persecuted Christians
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.320]   to triumph in trouble and difficulty
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.160]   and stand firm in their faith.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.840]   That's how the book begins, anchored
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   in the recognition of what God has done
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.120]   and what God guarantees to do.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.640]   Listen, life's hard.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.760]   It's not going to get better for a Christian.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.240]   The more it heats up, you're going
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.800]   to need to be anchored down.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.720]   You need to be strong and convinced.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.480]   And this is designed to help you stand out in your faith
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   and stand firm in your faith.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.120]   The other big idea that Peter is promoting
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.680]   is that in a culture that's dark,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.640]   you're to be a standout light.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.720]   You're to be an influencer for the gospel.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.560]   And I'm going quickly because we don't have a lot of time.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   So if you know this book, you're already connected.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.640]   But if not, I want to highlight some key ideas.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.440]   And one of those ideas is found in who we are,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.560]   verse 9, chapter 2.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.960]   "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood."
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.480]   Talking about those who are redeemed by the precious blood
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.080]   of Christ.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.040]   "If you're a Christian, you're a living stone,
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.960]   and you're a royal priest.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.520]   A holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.760]   Watch this, that you may proclaim the excellencies
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.400]   of him who has called you out of darkness
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.960]   into his marvelous light."
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.040]   If you're a Christian, you're a priest.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.680]   You're part of a priesthood.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.480]   Priests were God connectors.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.520]   Pontifex is the Latin words for bridge builder.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.640]   Priests were God connectors, connecting people
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.160]   to God and God to people.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.040]   You're a go-between.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.480]   The ultimate mediator is Jesus Christ, the great high priest.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.880]   And as his representative, you connect people to God.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.400]   That's the big idea I want you to hear,
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.240]   because it's all going to go back for you to verse 7,
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.160]   chapter 3.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.480]   "You are a God connector.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.720]   Wherever you walk, wherever you live, whatever you do,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.080]   your neighborhood, your vocation, your schooling,
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.560]   your activities, your hobbies, you're
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.680]   the guy that God has appointed as a part of his divine family
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.280]   to connect people to him.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   And you do that according to verse 9,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.240]   in part by proclaiming the excellencies
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   of him who has called you out of darkness
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.040]   into his marvelous light."
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.640]   You're a God proclaimer.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.400]   You're a God talker.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.080]   It's by what you say about him and by what he has done for you.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.360]   I needed mercy.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.040]   I hadn't experienced mercy.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.960]   I have a personal testimony.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   And if I'm a priest, I'm to declare that.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.680]   That's validating in words the gospel of God that changed you.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.960]   He says in verse 10, "You were once not a people,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.840]   but now you are the people of God.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.760]   You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.200]   Verse 11, "Act like it inwardly.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.440]   I urge you as aliens and strangers
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.800]   to abstain from fleshly lusts which
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.080]   wage war against your soul."
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.840]   Priests have to not only say it, but inwardly, you
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.320]   need to reflect it.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.760]   That will apply to what we're going to talk about at home.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.960]   What you are as a Christian is to validate and honor
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:43.720]   the greatness of God by what you say, by what you are inside,
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.360]   and what you display outside.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.460]   Verse 12, "Keep your behavior excellent."
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.960]   Excellent God, excellent proclamations,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.720]   internal moral excellence, because it'll kill your soul.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.520]   And verse 12, outward excellence, your behavior.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.360]   Keep it excellent among the Gentiles.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.520]   So in the thing in which they slander you as an evildoer,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.320]   because they don't give credibility to your claims,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.240]   but because they are watching your life in addition
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.520]   to your words, someday on account of your good deeds,
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.080]   verse 12, as they observe them, consequence,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.440]   they will glorify God in the day of visitation.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.800]   Now, I'm going to argue this is not the visitation where
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.920]   every knee will bow and every tongue will confess.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.700]   This is the return of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.440]   the rapture of Jesus Christ, where
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.760]   all of those converted to Christ as part of the family of God
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.160]   will bear witness to the glory that belongs to God.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.640]   Because everybody's going to give some witness
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.840]   to who Jesus Christ is, saved or unsaved.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.880]   Every knee will bow, every tongue will confess.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.920]   This is not that.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.880]   This is the confession of a former mocker
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.160]   who is now a God glorifier.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.320]   And why is he a God glorifier?
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.280]   Because of what you say, the priest of God,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.800]   in the community with which they have to do what they say,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.240]   what they are, and what they display.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.080]   All of that I put in the category of honoring God.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.200]   This is what this context, chapter 3, verse 7,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.280]   is connected to, because it's God-honoring behavior that
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.160]   validates the gospel you proclaim,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.280]   that mercy and grace.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:45.080]   It validates it, because it displays the effect of it.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.640]   So what I am in words, I need to be in practice.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.900]   This is the conduct that honors God.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.720]   And this is the conduct that validates the gospel of God,
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.560]   gives it credibility, so that a mocker becomes a professor
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.520]   and a God glorifier, a worshiper.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:12.400]   Here's why I'm sharing the context with you.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.120]   Because God-honoring, gospel-validating husbands
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.280]   who enjoy blessing from God and answered prayers from God
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:30.940]   are governed by a compelling conviction that this matters.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.020]   My conduct with my wife, which is
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.360]   a subset of the work that validates the gospel
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.180]   and honors God, it matters.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.100]   It matters to God, and it matters to anybody
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.460]   watching my life who's measuring the veracity
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.500]   of the gospel of God.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.420]   Which is why it says in verse 15,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.780]   "For such is the will of God that by doing right,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.180]   you may silence the ignorance of foolish men."
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.820]   You take away their claim that this is not believable,
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.340]   credible.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.300]   The mocking is unjustified, because your life
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.140]   undermines the mocking.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.060]   It puts them to silence.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   And their talk is stopping, not because they don't
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.940]   have a tongue and a mouth, but because of the quality
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.380]   and the caliber and the credibility of your life,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:35.340]   what you say and what you display, they're muted.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.940]   They can't argue with that.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.300]   The context of chapter 3, verse 7
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:48.780]   is the display of the conduct that mutes the mocker.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:55.540]   It honors God, and it validates the gospel of God.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.020]   In the same way, verse 1, connected to verse 7,
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.900]   "You husbands likewise," is connected
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.900]   to the main verbal idea of that conduct
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.320]   that Peter is unpacking.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.960]   And that is the main verb, verse 13, chapter 2,
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.140]   "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake."
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   Submit is the governing verbal behavior,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.340]   the prescriptive requirement, the commandment,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.540]   the imperative, not optional.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.260]   This is what good behavior looks like that validates
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.180]   the gospel of God and honors God.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.740]   It involves submission, submission
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.620]   to rightful authority.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.140]   Submit, verse 13.
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.620]   Then he says, in the larger conduct,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.380]   citizens, verses 13 through 17, citizen conduct is submission.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.940]   Slave or employee conduct submission, 2, 18 through 20.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.900]   Wife submission, in the same way,
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.700]   she should submit, chapter 3, 1 through 6.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.500]   And I'm going to argue 3, 7, "You husbands likewise,"
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.660]   likewise what?
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.020]   Submit like she submits.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.340]   Who are you submitting to?
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.300]   God's authority over you.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.540]   In the same way, "be subject," and let
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.100]   me just give you a little bit of verbal definition.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.300]   "Be subject," tasso, "is to arrange," hupo, "under."
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.820]   You voluntarily arrange yourself under the leadership
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.460]   of another.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.740]   I choose to follow.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.160]   It's willing and respectfully following.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.180]   Whether it's a governor, whether it's an employer,
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.860]   whether it's a husband or a husband,
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.520]   his divine authority in the home is Christ himself.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.980]   And really, the centerpiece of this whole passage
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.980]   is chapter 2, 21 through 25, and that's
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.500]   the submission of the son to the father's will.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.380]   Like Christ did, like a Christian citizen
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.780]   does, like an employee should or a wife or a husband
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.820]   should, in order to be a God presenter, a God connector,
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.860]   you need to connect or you need to conduct yourself
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.780]   excellently and honorably.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.620]   How?
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.060]   By submitting to your authority.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.740]   Gentlemen, this starts with the compelling conviction
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.140]   that not only does this matter to God, His honor,
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.180]   not only does it matter to the hearers of the gospel
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.300]   the credibility of it, but it matters
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:43.380]   because you are saying, I am submitting to Christ.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:49.180]   This is about honoring Him and surrendering and obeying Him.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.100]   Conducting yourself excellently and honorably
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.140]   by submitting to your authority, even in the face--
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.060]   and this is another theme in this section--
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.180]   even in the face of unjust, unfair, and difficult
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.420]   circumstances.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.620]   You have the employee, verse 19, that finds favor.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.460]   Well, verse 18, you're to do this.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.260]   It's good even to those who are unreasonable.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.500]   Verse 18, verse 19, for this finds favor,
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.940]   submitting to your authority.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.140]   If for the sake of conscience towards God,
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.500]   a man bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly,
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.740]   for what credit is there when you sin and are harshly treated,
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.940]   you endure it with patience.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.340]   But if and when you do what is right by submitting
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.300]   with the right attitude and right behavior,
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.940]   you suffer for it-- in other words,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.100]   it's not going well-- and patiently endure it,
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.700]   this finds favor with God.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.500]   And then chapter 3, 1 through 6 says to the wife,
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.860]   even if your husband is AWOL, he's not following God,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.700]   you in the same way submit, even if it's not just,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.460]   even if it's not fair.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.660]   Likewise, you husbands, if you're
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:06.980]   living with someone who's not a God follower or God honoring,
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.220]   even if it's hard and it's unjust and it's difficult,
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.500]   you in the same way follow Christ
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:21.180]   by following his prescription in this verse, in the same way.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.860]   So here's the characteristic of a God honoring, gospel
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.020]   validating, and gospel blessing husband.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.740]   And I say gospel blessing because it's
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.660]   a God who listens to the prayers of such a man
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.700]   and brings blessing and benefit to that man
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.740]   because he qualifies.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.700]   Remember James 5.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.180]   I'm teaching it on Sundays here at our church.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.860]   The effectual, the effective, fervent prayer
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.660]   of a righteous man can accomplish much.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.540]   You know what 1 Peter 3.7 does?
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.820]   It qualifies rightness at home.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.500]   And if there's no righteousness at home,
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   there's no effectual praying that accomplishes much.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.540]   How much?
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.380]   Well, it can stop it from raining for 3 and 1/2 years.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.420]   It can start it raining again.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.220]   That's a lot.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.620]   Would you agree with that?
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.620]   But you have to be qualified to pray
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.380]   a prayer that does a lot.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.060]   And in 1 Peter 3.7, qualified praying
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.500]   is honoring and submitting to the prescriptive authority
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.340]   of the Son of God to husbands who
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.500]   are living with a wife for the glory of God
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.900]   and for the validating of the gospel of God.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.500]   That's the big idea.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.140]   So the first thought is, if you want to be that kind of man,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.300]   you have to have and possess a compelling conviction
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:42.940]   that this matters.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:49.020]   How a wife treats her husband and how a husband treats
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.860]   a wife matters to God and affects the impact
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.380]   of the gospel of God.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.020]   Listen, you need to recognize that your marriage is not
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.940]   first and just about your satisfaction.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.940]   It is about God's reputation.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.980]   It's about your neighbor's conversion.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.460]   This perspective and heart conviction
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.860]   is foundational and non-negotiable
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.020]   for the God-honoring, gospel-validating,
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.060]   and I expect to be blessed by God, husband.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.420]   It starts there.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.900]   And frankly, everything else that we
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.980]   will unpack from this passage is undermined
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.140]   if there's not a bedrock conviction.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.580]   And you know what a conviction is.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.620]   It's a compelling belief.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.100]   It's not just something you give mental assent to.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.180]   It's something that motivates you
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.980]   and your actions and your behaviors and your attitudes.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.820]   You don't have a conviction unless it's
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.020]   a compelling belief.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.220]   This is about a compelling conviction which
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.540]   says, man, this matters.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.620]   Now you're standing here today, however you got here,
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.380]   whether you're here because she made you come
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.900]   or whether you're here because you know what, I need this.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.060]   I need to understand what I don't understand.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.100]   Second characteristic of a God-honoring, gospel-validating,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.220]   and God-blessing husband is they express
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.420]   faith-filled submission.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.740]   I've already touched on this.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.020]   This involves submission.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:31.100]   And I'm saying it's faith-filled because what is being done
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.620]   is something that requires faith.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.660]   They express faith-filled submission
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.900]   to their authority in the home and in all things Christ.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.300]   They actively and voluntarily submit
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.820]   to the sovereignty and the authority of God.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.620]   If you're a keeper of verse 7, it's
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.180]   because you're submitting to his authority and his sovereignty,
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.460]   his right to rule, recognizing-- listen to this--
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.300]   that God created your marriage.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:05.020]   What God joins, that God defines the nature of your marriage.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.780]   It's a covenant, not a contract.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.820]   You do.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.220]   If you do, I will.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.020]   That's not what this is.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.900]   This is I will even if you don't.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:18.020]   This is for better or for worse.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:26.060]   And that God rules over the circumstances of your marriage.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.660]   This is-- what I have is what he wants.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.380]   It may not be what I expected, but he rules in it,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.580]   he governs it, and he expects me to act like it.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.300]   They express faith-filled submission
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.500]   to the plan of God, recognizing he designed and defined
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.820]   the purpose of marriage.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.900]   You know what purpose marriage is first and most about?
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.260]   A picture of the greatest love relationship in the universe,
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.100]   that of Christ and his bride, Ephesians 5.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.860]   The greatest love and the duration of your marriage,
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.740]   you submit to this until death do us part.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.700]   Submission is cardinal to success
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.660]   in honoring God, validating the gospel of God,
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.420]   and having your prayers not hindered
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.020]   as you pray them to God.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.340]   Thirdly, they express faith-filled submission
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.060]   to the capacity of God, recognizing his ability
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.620]   to change and use your marriage.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.540]   To save through it, because you're going to hear me argue,
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.820]   it could be that the fellow heir of the grace of life
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.220]   is talking about an unbeliever, not a believer.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.140]   Because chapter 3, verse 1, is talking about an AWOL husband
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.420]   who is probably not a believer.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.820]   He may be.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.140]   And what a husband does by his behavior with someone
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.300]   who shares life, but not spiritual life,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.060]   is he influences them by living as a husband should
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.260]   under the authority of God.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.260]   He's a God follower submitted to God's lordship and leadership.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.620]   Let me summarize it this way.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.300]   In the same way as the aforementioned citizens,
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.580]   employees, and Christ did, the husband
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.780]   is to subject himself to God's expectation
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.700]   in the home and the culture by conducting themselves honorably,
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.340]   even in the face of unjust, unrighteous, and difficult
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.540]   circumstances.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.500]   Verse 23, Jesus accepted a lot of reviling,
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.820]   didn't revile in return.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.260]   Verse 23, chapter 2, he did not revile in return.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.900]   While suffering, he uttered no threats,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.020]   but he kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.180]   I'm not only submitted to him, I'm
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:51.820]   trusting him so that you can be a God-glorifying,
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.220]   standout witness for Jesus Christ.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:03.420]   Number three, God-honoring, gospel-validating.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.780]   And husbands who enjoy God's blessing through prayer
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.540]   are characterized by committed--
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.220]   I'm going to give you several words that
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.980]   are housed in this verse--
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:20.380]   committed, engaging, and considerate.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:26.820]   Committed, engaging, and considerate cohabitation
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.060]   and collaboration.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.460]   I know that's a big sentence, but I couldn't help myself.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.780]   That's what's in this verse.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.620]   They are characterized by committed, engaging,
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.260]   and considerate cohabitation and collaboration.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.500]   The characteristics of a God-honoring,
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.900]   gospel-validating, God-blessing husband
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.060]   is they are willing, they're engaging,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:56.580]   they are a gracious and honoring leader.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.140]   You display committed and considerate cohabitation.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.820]   That's personal engagement.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.260]   I wrote this.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.180]   He commits to considerate collaboration, not just
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.220]   "I have to" cohabitation.
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.700]   By living with your wife in an understanding way.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.780]   Let's look at verse 7 specifically.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.940]   "You husbands likewise."
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.140]   "Likewise" introduces the main verb.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.620]   You submit, like she does in the same way,
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.820]   like Christ did to His Father, like citizens do to governors.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.740]   That's the main verb.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.820]   "You husbands likewise submit."
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.060]   Now, this is a participle.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.300]   It modifies the main verb.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.100]   That's important because it explains how you're
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.140]   to live out the submission.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.740]   It's an instrumental participle, "by."
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.860]   It's a present tense verb participle,
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.900]   which means this is a progressive, active,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.740]   habitual behavior.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.860]   If you're a submitter, you're going
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:06.740]   to display that submission by ongoing, regular, daily living.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.660]   Living with her.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.940]   It picks up its imperatival sense
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.380]   from the main verb, which is not optional.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.420]   So "you husbands," I'm just unpacking it
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.980]   so that you own the authority of the scripture behind it.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.380]   "You husbands submit."
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.140]   Just like she submits to you, you're
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:33.500]   to submit to Christ by living with her.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.420]   Let's talk living for a minute.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.380]   The word means dwelling with, residing with.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.140]   It has the idea of personal engagement,
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.460]   not just you're in the same house.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.540]   By living and dwelling with, let's just
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.620]   start with the basics.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.140]   You live and dwell with them, not divorcing them,
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.500]   not separating from them, not running away from them,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.100]   not escaping from them.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.780]   You're living with them, not just rooming with them.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   This is not separate lives or separate beds.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.180]   The word "living" has to do with engaging.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.180]   It's personal interaction.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:17.220]   Living with is not just eating, showering, and sleeping
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.580]   in the same house.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:24.860]   The word involves proximity and engaging relational activity.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:31.340]   It's doing a life with them, not just living life in the house.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.900]   Now, I think that's important because part
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.980]   of what you do when you honor God
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.340]   is proactively pursue relationship.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.260]   You're not too tired when you come home
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.420]   from work or from ministry.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.820]   You have some spoons or money in the relational bank.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.220]   You haven't used up all your words or all your interest.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:54.340]   You are coming home, and you're engaging with her.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.060]   You're the proactive pursuer.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:04.620]   Living with her is submitting to Christ at home
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.300]   by proactively engaging her.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.900]   And how does he live with her?
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.860]   Considerately.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.900]   Live with your wives in an understanding way,
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:24.060]   literally according to knowledge,
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.140]   the knowledge of what she is.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.900]   She's a woman, which is what the passage says.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.580]   The knowledge of what she is, this
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.300]   is general knowledge you need to have.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.900]   She's a woman.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.780]   You say, thanks a lot.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.860]   I already know that.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:42.100]   No, you need to understand what a woman is by virtue
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:48.460]   of these two big categories, her constitution, a weaker vessel,
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:54.660]   and her social status or station, lesser, not respected.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.060]   She's a woman, and her physical constitution
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.100]   and her social position are normatively weaker.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.300]   You live with her as--
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.740]   that's a comparative word--
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.700]   as with a weaker vessel.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.660]   The presumption is she's physically weaker.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.020]   I mean, if you have a jar that can't be opened at home,
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.220]   do the kids bring it to you or her?
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.980]   Don't answer that if they bring it to her.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:26.380]   There's a reason that the world powerlifting champion for women
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.780]   is a trans guy.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.940]   That's a true statement.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:39.780]   Look, if you arm wrestle and she wins, we need to talk after.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.900]   Weaker, it means without strength, lesser strength
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:52.100]   by comparison, not strong compared to you.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.540]   You need to recognize that in her physical constitution,
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.780]   she's in need of support and protection.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.740]   That's the idea.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.900]   He tells Peter here that husbands,
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.980]   God-honoring, gospel-validating, and God-blessing husbands
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.580]   are to live with their wife according
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.020]   to the common knowledge that as a woman,
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.900]   she's generally weaker physically
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.820]   than her husband is, who's a man.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.140]   The key idea would imply personal and physical
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.380]   protection, the assumption being she's vulnerable
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.180]   without that protection.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.540]   She's vulnerable to injury and harm.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.860]   Ellicott, the commentator, says all of chivalry
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.380]   is in these words.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.180]   "Weakness itself," he writes, "by being weakness
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.140]   has a claim upon the stronger man's deference
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.660]   and self-submission."
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.900]   This is about considering her and living with her
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.300]   in a way that recognizes she needs your protection.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:02.020]   I write it this way.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:08.300]   Practically, he, you, walk on the vehicle side of the street.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.620]   You remove the snakes and you kill the spiders.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.940]   You check out the noise in the night.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:21.860]   Honey, go check that out.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.380]   What is that?
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:28.620]   You're the one who provides protection
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.940]   from predators and bad actors.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.060]   This kind of husband keeps his wife out of situations
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.420]   that endanger her.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.900]   Listen, I live in a very safe neighborhood
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.900]   if there is such a thing in Southern California.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.100]   It's the country and the city.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.900]   But Karen's not going for a walk around our college campus
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.460]   without our German shepherd walking with her.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:57.580]   I tell her, I said, honey, I don't know of a guy
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.980]   that you're going to win over.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.420]   Overpower is what I mean by that.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.020]   You're not walking alone at night.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.300]   And you're not driving alone at night into that part of town.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.180]   No way, no how.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.060]   Otherwise, I'm going.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:21.980]   Because a husband who lives with his wife according to knowledge
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.980]   understands that.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.100]   And he treats her like that, chivalrously.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:35.100]   And by the way, weaker is not a reference to tougher.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.500]   You ever see a woman birth a baby?
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.340]   She's tough.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.780]   This is not about smarter.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.460]   She's not intellectually weaker.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.540]   Do you know how many women are compellingly bright?
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.740]   This is not about smarts.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.980]   And it's not about she's lesser because she's weaker.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.260]   It's not like we're better because we're stronger.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:04.300]   This is simply a reference to the fact that she's vulnerable
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.180]   and you're to protect her.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.940]   My wife would expect me to protect her
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:16.060]   by what comes across the television screen at our house,
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.620]   what she gets exposed to.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.140]   She's actually under the conviction
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.420]   that it's her husband's responsibility
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.020]   to watch out for her, not just physically, but emotionally.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.660]   That's what these words--
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.540]   and let me add this.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.860]   And women in that day--
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.260]   listen to this-- not regarded in society at all,
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.540]   treated like a Gentile or a dog.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.380]   In other words, she had no status in that culture
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.740]   when Peter's writing this.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.080]   Oh yeah, they could have babies.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.700]   They could own property.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.660]   They were considered citizens.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.020]   But that's it.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.180]   No societal influence, no social influence.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.340]   Part of what a husband does is recognizing
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.740]   her physical station as weaker and her social status
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.260]   is lesser.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.620]   So I'm going to argue, gentlemen,
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.180]   you live with her in a right way.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.540]   You're going to treat her with honor and respect in ways
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.620]   a culture never could.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.300]   It's not about her demanding anything.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.240]   It's about you honoring her because you
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.500]   are the stronger, both socially and physically.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.660]   Let me add this too.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.340]   Cohabitation, considerate cohabitation
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.060]   is more than general knowledge.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.900]   Gentlemen, you need to have specific working knowledge.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.500]   Notice what the passage says.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.700]   Live with your wife in an understanding way.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.920]   You know what that introduces?
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.420]   My wife is not your wife.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.860]   Your wife is not my wife or somebody else's.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.220]   Well, you need to know your girl.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:59.500]   You need to be a master at knowing her.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.880]   My wife, horses, not motorcycles.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.860]   Chocolate chip, not oatmeal raisin.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.780]   Country, not city.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.180]   Boots, not heels.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.180]   Jeans, not dresses.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:18.220]   Chocolates, not jewelry.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.060]   Russell Stover's or C's.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.460]   Craftsman, not modern.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.700]   I'm talking about architectural and interior design.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:31.940]   My wife needs time to decide.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.820]   She's a time to process decider, not a turn
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.620]   on a dime decision maker.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.500]   I'm the one who can turn on a dime.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.300]   But learning to live with her is recognition she needs time.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.900]   And Karen, my wife, it's time with her and for her,
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.460]   not we in a group.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.700]   Now, I'm a pastor.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.540]   Guess what I do?
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.040]   Groups.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:00.260]   But my wife needs time not in a group.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.660]   Your wife is not my wife.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.820]   You need to know your wife.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.860]   You need to be a specialist.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.540]   You live with her according to knowledge.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.060]   You're a student of her.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.980]   This is what submitting to Christ looks like
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.420]   if you're going to honor God.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.660]   Your wife doesn't have to clamor for attention.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.460]   She does not have to demand your interest.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.860]   You're showing up ready to engage,
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.540]   informed by the reality of who she is as a woman generally
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.660]   and who she is as your wife.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.860]   Listen, Deuteronomy 24.5, and it ought to get our attention,
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.940]   says this, "When a man takes a new wife,
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.540]   he shall not go out with the army
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.460]   nor be charged with any duty.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.540]   He shall be free at home one year
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.900]   and shall give happiness to his wife whom he has taken."
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.740]   Now, you can interpret that a lot of ways.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.740]   But I don't think I'm staying at home for a year
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.260]   so she can learn how to make me happy.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.580]   This is I'm learning how to make her happy.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:11.420]   I'm learning how to minister to her specifically and uniquely.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:17.780]   There's a second thing about considerate cohabitation,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:22.300]   and it does involve considerate collaboration.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.820]   I'm going to just mention this for the sake of time today,
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.980]   but your marriage is about a divine partnership
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.500]   and friendship.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.380]   This is Genesis 128.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:41.380]   God made them male and female.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.780]   He dispensed and deposited His glory into two
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.700]   who in a complementary marriage relationship
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.060]   represent the glories of God together.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.340]   "It is not good," this is God in a perfect world,
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.260]   six days of creation not complete.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.500]   He looks at the world He's made and He said,
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.860]   "It is not good for Adam to be alone, man to be alone."
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.780]   Remember this?
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.020]   Not good to be alone.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.820]   What do you mean He's alone?
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.260]   God's there.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.580]   Got a whole wealth of the animal kingdom,
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.420]   spot and all of His other breeds are there.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.580]   Some people think spot's all you need.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.660]   God didn't think that's all you needed.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.460]   He looked at a perfect world that He had created
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.980]   and He said, "Adam, it's not good for you to be alone."
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.340]   So I'm going to make a helper.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.700]   Do you know what that word means?
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.060]   Someone who makes up what that which is lacking.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.220]   Lacking for what?
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.780]   The purpose for which I made you.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.980]   I made you, and gentlemen, God made every one of you.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.540]   This is the, you know that, but for a purpose.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.940]   Acts 13, 36, when David finished his purpose
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.820]   in his generation, he fell asleep.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.140]   Now, does anyone even want to argue
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.340]   that David's the only guy that had a purpose from God?
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:08.340]   Every designed child of God, every man of God,
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.500]   every human being is purposed by God
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.060]   for a purpose in your generation.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.820]   You are missional by design,
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.460]   and your mission is your mission.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.140]   I'm doing my mission, and critical to my mission
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.580]   is somebody who makes up what I lack.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.300]   Because I can't get this done without the partner
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.700]   that God said I needed to do what He created me to do.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.980]   So if you're going to cohabit with her,
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.660]   you need to collaborate with her,
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.260]   because she's your partner.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.660]   I would put it this way.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.580]   You lack a practical partner, a teammate,
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.140]   so that you can fulfill the destiny and purpose
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.260]   and mission for which God made you.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:57.620]   And if you're living with her according to knowledge,
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.620]   you get that, which made you include her.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.460]   It's not like you leave it all at the office
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.620]   or all at the church.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.820]   You actually have a partner to walk with you.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.260]   Now listen, there's certain spaces
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.420]   and things you can't talk about at home with your wife.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.900]   I have a thing with my elders.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.500]   We have a confidential environment
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.340]   unless we release you from confidence
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.020]   because you can't go home and tell her
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.700]   because she wasn't in the meeting.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.820]   So I'm not advocating that she becomes,
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.460]   it's Pastor Harry and Pastor Karen.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.820]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.260]   I'm saying she's your partner essentially.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.620]   That's a collaborating relationship,
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.380]   and it's a necessary one.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.180]   Your wife needs to own your journey.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:47.020]   The greatest advocate, cheerleader in your life,
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.540]   committed to your calling should be your girl.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.220]   And she's not gonna be unless you include her
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.740]   because this is living with her in an understanding way.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:05.980]   The second thing it says she is, she is a helper suitable.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.060]   It's a Hebrew word which means she fits,
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.540]   like a puzzle piece used to broken pottery.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:15.380]   Translated in the book of Proverbs as intimate companion.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.020]   Do you know what your wife is?
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.060]   You're living with her in an understanding way,
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.580]   a necessary intimate friend.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.220]   Your best buddies ought not be ministry buddies
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:33.140]   because they're not suitable for that.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.220]   She's God-crafted for that.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:40.940]   So this is about collaborating with her
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.540]   as a partner in your mission
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.100]   and as a companion for your life.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.500]   And if there's not time for that,
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.300]   you're not submitted to the requirement of living with her
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.300]   in a way that's according to knowledge.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:02.340]   The fourth characteristic of a God-honoring gospel
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.420]   validating a God-blessing husband
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:14.540]   is he's committed to displaying a respectful disposition
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.860]   and honoring his wife's high position.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.420]   Now I know if you read Ephesians,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.180]   there's a book title that says love and respect.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:30.020]   Let me tell you what you are commanded to do as a husband.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:30.860]   Love your wife.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.140]   Present active imperative, Colossians chapter three,
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:41.500]   verse 19 says, "Husbands, always love your wife."
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.540]   It's non-negotiable, it's a requirement.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.980]   By the way, only two verbs for husbands in Colossians.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:51.140]   A lot written in Ephesians, 11 verses,
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.220]   one verse to husbands.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.020]   You only have to memorize one verse
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.620]   because her verse isn't for you.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.340]   Her verse says, "Wives, submit yourself to your husbands."
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.180]   Notice what doesn't start,
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.420]   "Husbands, make your wife submit," doesn't say that.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.780]   She's got one verse, you have one verse, you have two verbs.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.140]   Husbands, love your wife.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.520]   And then he goes on to say,
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.420]   "And don't ever be harsh with her."
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.900]   You know what's housed in harsh?
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.980]   Don't be embittered.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.340]   The word embittered means you've been injured by her
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.660]   and you injure back.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.980]   Typically, she's gonna injure you with words.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.580]   Rarely is she gonna beat you up.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.480]   Going back to the weaker vessel thing.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.140]   So when she injures you with words,
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.860]   what do you not do ever?
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.340]   Injure her back with words.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.660]   This is what you always do, you love her.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.340]   You consider her needs greater than your own.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.320]   We know, loved by this, that he laid down his life for us.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.460]   It's sacrificial.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.840]   For us, it's beneficial.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   When did he do that?
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.380]   Why we were his enemies, unconditional.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.500]   We know, loved by this, that he himself,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.180]   that's personal.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.380]   He didn't hire somebody as a surrogate.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.740]   Laid down his life for us.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.620]   That's what love is.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.060]   That's what love does.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.940]   That's what we're commanded to do.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.340]   And the thing we're never to do
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:19.020]   is to treat her with disrespect, harshly, and harm her.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:24.020]   Listen, your woman, your wife, comes soft.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.480]   You want her to stay soft.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:33.040]   You can callous by harshness
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.680]   what you need most from her, which is intimacy.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.160]   Vulnerability in every kind of way.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:45.520]   This is the divine design when God said,
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.000]   I'm going to make a helper, a practical partner,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.800]   intimate companion for you.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.640]   Remember what Adam did?
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.720]   He looked at every other option.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.040]   Started naming the animals,
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.520]   and at the end of that exercise,
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   which showed his missional calling
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.640]   as regent over the created world,
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.040]   what did it say?
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   And there was not found anyone or anything suitable to him.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.240]   So then he gets put to sleep.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.360]   God takes from his core, out of his core,
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.720]   the rib which he fashions, that is an art word,
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.740]   custom makes, a woman from his rib.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.440]   So from his core, for his core need,
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.440]   God supernaturally creates from him, for him,
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.880]   masterfully and artfully,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.640]   a solution to what he didn't have, a helper suitable.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.240]   You may not know this, but when it says,
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.920]   and God brought her to the man,
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.540]   the word brought means he unveiled her to him.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.520]   That's why brides used to wear veils,
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.220]   because the father who represents God
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.560]   would bring her down the aisle,
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.260]   and at the appropriate time, he would unveil her.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.180]   That's what God did.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.060]   It's not like, hey, check it out.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:11.120]   I'm imagining it was much more like this.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.520]   God in front, her behind, and he steps aside and said,
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.960]   this is, this is what I did.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.760]   And you know what Adam did to that?
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.100]   Now we're talking, right?
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.320]   That's what he said.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.600]   This is now, emphatic, now this is bone of my bones,
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.880]   flesh of my flesh.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.560]   This is what I couldn't find anywhere in a perfect world.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.280]   Remember that?
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.880]   Bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.760]   she shall be called Esha, woman,
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.200]   because she was taken out of Esh.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.500]   Do you hear the similarity?
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.680]   I want her to have a derivative of my name
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.920]   because I want everybody to know I agree with God,
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.800]   and she goes with me, which is why she gets your name.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.960]   She gets your name because it's your way of saying,
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.480]   I agree with God, this is what I needed and didn't have,
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.080]   and this is what he gave to me,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.140]   and I want the world to know this is what he gave to me.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:08.000]   Are you tracking with me?
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.920]   All right, now, so here's the deal.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.720]   If you don't live with her in an understanding way
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.880]   and high recognition of her high station
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.880]   in her human creation and God's custom provision,
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:25.840]   you're not gonna live with her according to this verse.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.640]   It's according to knowledge.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.760]   What knowledge?
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.880]   That knowledge.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.520]   If you would happen to pick up my phone
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   and my wife is calling, it would say Princess Karen,
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.880]   and you say aww, all the women would say aww,
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.720]   but you know why it says that?
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.680]   Yes, she's a princess, yes, she's my princess,
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.520]   but you know why that is?
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.640]   'Cause I forget that.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.580]   I just forget who she is.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.480]   I need to remember who she is,
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.720]   so whatever you do to help you live with her
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.860]   in according to a way that recognizes real knowledge
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   and real revelation so you'll treat her like that, do that.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:13.200]   Otherwise, your prayers are hindered.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.120]   Respectful disposition, not a harsh one.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   Honoring your wife's high station.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.520]   Let's go back to the verse, verse seven,
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.440]   'cause we're kinda unpacking it.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   Since she's a woman, do you see the and?
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.840]   It's a connective.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.320]   It's adding one other participle saying
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.120]   this is what submission looks like.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.040]   It begins with engaging, considerate,
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   cohabitation, involvement, and this is a participle,
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.240]   verse seven, and granting her honor.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.200]   So I'm only submitting, I'm only honoring the Lord,
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.320]   I'm only validating the gospel
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.480]   if I add to my living with her according to knowledge
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.840]   by elevating her, granting her honor.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.680]   Granting her honor.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:11.900]   He daily shows his wife honor.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.020]   This word simply put means you treat her
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.440]   as if she has high value and great worth.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:25.720]   You pay your respect towards her
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.280]   and you behave respectfully towards her
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.580]   because you recognize the value she shares.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.120]   You grant her honor.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.340]   Someone has said honor and love are not the same things.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.480]   Love is a willful sacrificial action and strong affection.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.200]   Honor is to think highly, to respect highly,
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.220]   to show respect for, to recognize the value of
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.580]   and bestow regard for in light of that value.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.960]   Here's what a God honoring gospel validating,
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.640]   God answering and blessing a husband does.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.960]   He assigns and displays value and worth to his wife
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.880]   by respectful, you have high value
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.880]   and you are my equal attitudes and actions.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.480]   First he honors his wife as an equal.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.320]   She's a fellow heir.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.560]   Fellow means she's on my par.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.480]   She has an equal station with me.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.120]   She's a share of similar condition or status that I do.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.480]   She has different roles, responsibilities,
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.080]   abilities and capacities,
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.920]   but what she possesses is equal value and position.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.400]   She's a fellow heir.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.880]   Fellow makes her equal.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:39.440]   She is not inferior.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.680]   She has a secondary responsibility and leadership,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.520]   but that doesn't make her lesser
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.680]   any more than when Jesus said I come to do your will,
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.640]   not my own, makes him lesser.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:56.320]   Second he honors her as an equal heir.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   That is someone who shares a high station by grace.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.220]   That's what it says, a fellow heir of the grace of life.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:08.640]   She has a unique position in creation with you
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.800]   and if she's a Christian,
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.520]   she has a unique position with you in salvation
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.640]   because this is unmerited life
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.160]   and I'm gonna argue it's life in two potential ways.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.120]   The reason you treat her as an equal
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.560]   is because she enjoys what you enjoy,
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.440]   which is natural life.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.120]   So I don't find any good reason to say this has,
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.280]   to say exclusively, it only involves
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.760]   to the shared space we have as children of God.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.120]   She's a fellow heir of the salvation benefits that I enjoy.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:45.520]   No good reason to restrict this phrase
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.120]   to a reference only to spiritual and eternal life.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.840]   Matter of fact, one commentator says here,
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.520]   therefore we may well suppose that he's thinking chiefly
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.280]   of the case of believing husbands
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.360]   married to unbelieving wives.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.480]   The first thing is that they are to dwell with these wives,
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.640]   not to divorce them,
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.520]   not to see cease with conjugal cohabitation with them.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.000]   Such harshness would inhibit the gospel
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.280]   and misrepresent Christianity.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.080]   This is the potential, this commentator writes,
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.100]   application of Paul's declaration
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.960]   that the unbelieving wife is sanctified by her husband.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.560]   Now I wanna argue exegetically,
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.360]   that means based on the context
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.600]   and everything else going on,
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.120]   this whole section is one example after another
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.520]   of living honorably and differently
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.300]   in the face of difficulty.
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.880]   I'm gonna argue it's likely that this girl
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.320]   that you're supposed to grant honor to
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.700]   may not be having in honorable ways.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:46.280]   But she's a fellow heir of the life that you breathe
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.040]   and the life you enjoy, treat her with that.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.160]   So you honor her and respect her
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.080]   in view of the purposeful creation by God,
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.280]   that she's your partner, your companion,
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.820]   she's the co-regent with you over God's natural creation.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:04.820]   You honor her in recognition of that.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:11.820]   Listen, the world should not have to clamor
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.780]   to elevate a woman in marriage.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.620]   That should start with us.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:23.740]   Further, if she's saved,
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.660]   she's an equal heir with you
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.860]   and she shares the high station
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.620]   and unique position in redemption that you share.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.940]   Her worth is not just in her creation,
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.100]   but in her salvation.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.820]   A God-honoring husband renders his wife honor
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.220]   in light of the fact that they are co-heirs
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.380]   as children of God enjoying the grace of eternal life
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.140]   with all of its presence and future benefits.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.240]   You know this, of all Christians, male and female,
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.580]   the scripture says that we are all children of God
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:59.420]   and heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.100]   So that whatever Christ has, we share,
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.580]   whatever I share with Christ, she shares.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.680]   It is a high station.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:12.900]   You grant her as a woman, remembering Galatians 3:26,
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.340]   "There's neither bond nor free, nor rich, nor poor,
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.120]   "nor male, nor female."
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.300]   Our identity in Jesus Christ is equal
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:25.040]   and therefore we treat her with that equality
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.380]   and that high station.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:32.540]   I'm the pastor, I'm the husband, I'm the father,
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.220]   I'm the leader of the home.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.140]   Those are responsibilities that I have.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:42.140]   They are not status symbols or definitions or titles.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.620]   Are you with me?
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.420]   This is biblical Christianity.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.300]   This is what's to cause the world around you to listen.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.860]   All right, I'm gonna flesh this out.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.980]   I only have a few minutes left
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:55.860]   so you take notes fast or you're just gonna have
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.160]   to listen hard.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.740]   'Cause I got some things I want to share
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.700]   by way of the unpacking of the grace of life.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.400]   Seven ways, okay, so they're gonna be fast.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   God honoring, gospel validating husbands.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.780]   Respect and honor the reality of this shared
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.660]   grace of life station.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.980]   Creation and salvation.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:23.420]   Treating his wife as an essential kingdom mission
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.820]   partner, not just a housekeeper.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:31.860]   He solicits, receives, respects, and values her input
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:35.620]   on life, family, and ministry priorities.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.360]   He respects her opinion.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:44.040]   Number two, he treats his wife as an intimate companion
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.380]   with whom he shares his life and soul.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.100]   He values her as a one-of-a-kind solution
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.100]   to his aloneness problem.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.340]   Therefore, he prioritizes time with her.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   He communicates his heart with her and ask about her heart.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.900]   He does life with her, not just lives in the house with her,
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.540]   sharing duties with her.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.220]   He respects her as a life partner and best friend.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:14.820]   Three, he partners with his wife in their shared
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:17.900]   family responsibilities in the home.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.500]   I don't have time to go into this,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.900]   but during COVID, a lot of guys demonstrated
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.500]   whether they were owners at home or not.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.220]   They were at home, they just didn't do the work
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.780]   of a home sharer, partner.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:35.780]   We should be people that enter into the responsibilities
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.260]   of leading a home.
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.420]   Somebody's put it this way.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:41.800]   We need to involve in the unpaid work that she has.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.500]   We share it cognitive labor.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.460]   We help lead at home.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.580]   Men need to do their fair share of this labor.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.260]   I'll just say it simply as that.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.020]   Four, he affirms her rarity and beauty.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.100]   This is the grace of life.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.840]   If you get it, you're gonna affirm her rarity and beauty.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.920]   She's one-of-a-kind, she's custom-made for you.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.860]   You acknowledge her God-given talents and passions
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:10.100]   and you support their growth and expression
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.260]   for the glory of God and the good of men.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.660]   You are the leader of your wife first.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.420]   You maximize who she is.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.540]   You understand, according to knowledge,
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.780]   her giftedness, her passions.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.280]   That's what you do for people in the church.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.620]   You teach them the word of God and then you help them
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.240]   to realize their potential for the glory of God.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.780]   Job one is at home.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.260]   My wife needs to flourish.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.980]   Your wife needs to flourish.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.820]   Why?
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.340]   Because she's in a good church?
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.980]   No, because she's in a good home with a good husband.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.660]   He promotes her strengths and protects her weaknesses.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.380]   I'm hurrying, I know we need to go.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.220]   He respects his wife spiritually and recognizes her
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.340]   before God equality as a sister in Christ.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.480]   He does not regard himself as better than her
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.940]   or more important than her.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.040]   And finally, this is number seven.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.120]   He acknowledges and values her spiritual giftedness
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.480]   and promotes and supports her necessary
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.200]   and essential contribution to the body of Christ.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.680]   She is a fellow heir of everything I have.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.740]   We share it together.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.840]   And if I live with her in an understanding way
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.060]   that maximizes that, and gentlemen, you can agree with me,
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.680]   I'm 42 years in this June.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.540]   Dated her for two 42 years as her husband
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.820]   come June the fifth.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.760]   Guess what I am?
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.980]   Still learning.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.760]   So whatever Harry Walls has said to you today
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.960]   out of this passage, it's not because I have achieved
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.320]   or accomplished it all.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.600]   I am convinced that this is required of me
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.240]   before I taste heaven to secure this ground
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.240]   so that God is honored, the gospel is validated,
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.480]   and God hears and answers my prayers.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.640]   And guess what I need?
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.240]   That, can you say amen to that?
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.080]   - Amen.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.200]   - All right, gentlemen, thank you.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.040]   God bless you.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.200]   (audience applauding)
