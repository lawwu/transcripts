[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.400]   Today we look again at life when it's at its darkest.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.480]   Christians often go through dark seasons
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.480]   and sometimes long dark seasons.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.560]   Maybe that's you right now.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.700]   Maybe this episode is providentially put
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.600]   into your life right now for a reason.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000]   This is the context for today's email
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.420]   from a young man named Joshua.
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.960]   Joshua lives with his dad in California.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.080]   Is there anything I can do to help God help my dad?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.160]   We're not in the best living situation
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.380]   and although we've prayed,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740]   we haven't found a new place to live.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.620]   I'm actively pursuing the Lord in my mornings
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.440]   and trying to lead my dad here,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.100]   yet he still struggles with his faith.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.520]   Just last night he said that he doesn't feel
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.320]   God's love for him as a son.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.960]   Life is hard for him right now
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.480]   and God feels distant to him.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.440]   What can I say and how can I pray for a dad
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.720]   who does not feel God's love?
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   Joshua, here's what I would want my son to do for me
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.480]   if I were in a dark place like your dad is right now.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.920]   And I could be there.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.100]   I have been there.
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.440]   There's no Christian who doesn't experience seasons
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.440]   when God feels distant or when we don't feel his love
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.080]   as sweetly as we would like to.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.240]   So first, I would want you, my son,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.240]   to speak the truth to me about the objective reality
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.920]   of the love of God in the historical act
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.020]   of the death of his son.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   Even though your dad does not now feel the preciousness
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.400]   of the love of God in giving his only son,
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.560]   he needs to hear it.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.640]   Faith comes by hearing over and over,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.760]   not just at the beginning.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   Make the connection for him between the love of God
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.880]   and the death of Jesus
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.840]   because that's the rock solid objective foundation
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.400]   of our feelings of being loved.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.120]   For example, Romans 5, 6 to 8,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.320]   while we were still weak,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.880]   at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.280]   For one will scarcely die for a righteous person,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   though perhaps for a good person, one would dare even to die,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.840]   but God shows his love.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.660]   He shows, he shows, he demonstrates his love for us
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.660]   in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.120]   Galatians 2, 20, the life I now live,
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.400]   I live by faith in the son of God who loved me
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.280]   and gave himself for me.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.560]   First John 4, 10, in this is love,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.960]   not that we love God, but that he loved us
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.260]   John 15, 13, greater love has no one than this,
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.520]   that someone lay down his life for his friends.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.700]   And that precious, present, tense word loves
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.380]   in Revelation 1, 5, he loves us,
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.060]   not loved as in most places,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.060]   he loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.860]   That's what we need to hear.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.700]   That's what I would need to hear
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.820]   and your dad needs to hear
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.660]   when our feelings don't correspond to reality.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.660]   We need rock solid, objective, historical truth
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.900]   about the death of Jesus.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.500]   Number two, if I were your dad,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.820]   I would want to be reminded that the love of God for me
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.720]   was not only shown to me when Christ died,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.900]   but also when he made me alive
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.580]   and gave me the mustard seed of faith
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.400]   that I'm struggling to hold on to.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.380]   Ephesians 2, 4, God being rich in mercy
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.500]   because of the great love with which he loved us
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.220]   made us alive together with Christ.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.800]   If I have any life in me at all,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.340]   small as it feels right now,
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.140]   it is owing to the great love of God
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.780]   for me in making me alive.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.720]   Number three, remind your father
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.220]   that when God made us his own by his great love,
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.060]   nothing can now separate us from him.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.060]   Romans 8, 38.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.460]   I am sure that neither death nor life,
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.500]   nor angels nor rulers, nor things present,
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.480]   nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.540]   nor anything else in all creation
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.560]   will be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.460]   Number four, surprise him
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.060]   with a passage he may never have thought about.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.060]   Micah 7, verses eight and nine.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.620]   I love this passage.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.600]   I've called it gutsy guilt.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.120]   Rejoice not over me, O my enemy.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.620]   When I fall, I shall rise.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.900]   When I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light to me.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.940]   I will bear the indignation of the Lord
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.180]   because I have sinned against him
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.580]   until he pleads my cause
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.020]   and executes judgment for me.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.380]   He will bring me out to the light.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.340]   I shall look upon his vindication.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.580]   Wow.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.420]   Even when we sin our way into darkness,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.180]   the child of God can speak with boldness to the darkness
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.100]   and say, "Darkness, you will not have the last word."
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.980]   Even the God who put me here in discipline
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.220]   made darkness cover me.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.820]   He will bring me out.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.460]   He will execute judgment for me, not against me.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.740]   That's what I call gutsy guilt
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.160]   for the justified children of God.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.540]   And then take your dad, fifth,
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.240]   to Psalm 139, seven to 12,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.420]   and remind him that even when darkness covers us
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.420]   and wherever we go in our weariness and lack of feeling,
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.900]   God is there and he is our light.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.180]   Where shall I go from your spirit?
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.260]   Where shall I flee from your presence?
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.320]   If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.340]   If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.860]   If I take the wings of the morning
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.080]   and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.520]   even there your hand shall lead me
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.700]   and your right hand shall hold me.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.100]   If I say, and this is so relevant for his dad,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.080]   if I say, "Surely darkness shall cover me
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.760]   "and the light about me be night,"
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.780]   even the darkness is not dark to you, O God.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.660]   The night is bright as the day
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.660]   for darkness is as light with you.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.120]   That's Psalm 139, seven to 12.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.160]   And then add this promise for a sweet application
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.280]   of that Psalm, namely Psalm 30, verse five,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.920]   "Weeping may tarry for the night,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.040]   "but joy comes with the morning."
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.040]   And finally, remind him that the apostle Paul knew
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.160]   that the struggle to feel the love of Christ
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.640]   would be part of the Christian warfare.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.540]   So he taught us how to pray about it.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.800]   In Ephesians three, verses 18 and 19,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   "I pray that you may have strength to comprehend
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.000]   "with all the saints what is the breadth and length
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.400]   "and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.740]   "that surpasses knowledge and be filled
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.540]   "with all the fullness of God."
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.500]   The amazing thing about that prayer
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.320]   is that Paul shows us that it takes strength
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.900]   to comprehend the love of Christ.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.600]   There is a kind of soul strength
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.360]   that God gives in answer to prayer,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   which enables us to grasp and feel and enjoy
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.500]   the love of God in Christ for us personally.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.080]   So I pray, Joshua, that you will be filled with peace
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.500]   and joy and hope as you share these things with your father,
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.720]   and you can tell him that our little APJ band here
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.100]   is praying for him.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.940]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.320]   Thank you, Pastor John, for always being willing
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.980]   to field questions on the podcast
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.300]   when it comes to the darkest seasons of life.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.700]   Appreciate that.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.740]   And if you want to ask Pastor John,
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.440]   and maybe you have other questions
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.740]   related to your own season of darkness,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.740]   type out your question and email it to us
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.920]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.020]   Well, next week, we change gears to talk about books.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.040]   How have books changed John Piper's life?
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.100]   And which books have changed John Piper's life?
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.720]   Those are our two questions,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.140]   and they're both on the table next week,
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.380]   Monday and Thursday.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.020]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.180]   (upbeat music)
