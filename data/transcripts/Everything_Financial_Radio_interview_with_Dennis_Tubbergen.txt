[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.380]   Thank you very much for having me, Dennis.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.760]   Carl, let's give the listeners maybe that aren't aware
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.020]   a bit of a background or a bit of an overview
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.040]   as to the role of federal spending on medical care
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.300]   as compared to the rest of the budget
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.700]   and just kind of outline the topic for the listeners.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700]   Sure.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.640]   Medical spending is divided into two main parts
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.040]   in the federal budget.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.640]   Medicare, which is for old people,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.440]   and Medicaid, which is for people that don't have any money
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.180]   or at least very little money.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.080]   And those two parts are the major elements.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.920]   You hear a lot about things like VA,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.060]   which of course is for veterans,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.220]   but the truth is that the VA spending
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.200]   on veterans' medical costs is extremely small.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   You can't find it in the budget in terms of percentages.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.900]   Between Medicare and Medicaid, that is,
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.940]   last fiscal year was about 37% of all of the money
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.580]   that the federal government spends.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.180]   When people in the political sphere talk about entitlements,
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.780]   they always put together Medicare, Medicaid,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.660]   and Social Security.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.860]   And they do this for a reason, because first off,
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.500]   it makes the number much bigger and looks more difficult.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.300]   And secondly, it ties a program
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.400]   that has a temporary funding problem,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.840]   but which was anticipated by the people that wrote the law,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.740]   which is why you pay a 13% payroll tax approximately,
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.440]   that's Social Security.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.980]   They knew that there would be a large group of people
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.820]   that would eventually go through the system,
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.980]   and therefore the system had to run a surplus
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.120]   for a period of time to cover that,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.360]   but that those people would eventually all pass away
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.620]   because we all die.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.920]   So they always conflate that
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.560]   with the other two parts of the program.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.840]   Medicare has a very small tax, so about 2.5%.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.400]   Medicaid, of course, has no tax.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.440]   It's a straight handout.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.780]   So when you take those programs and you put them together,
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.280]   you take one that has temporary issues but is solvent
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.040]   because there is enough money that has been put aside
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.520]   in the form of Treasury bonds to cover this,
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.080]   with two others that there is no solution to
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   at present growth rates,
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.420]   and then you say, "We can't fix it
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.720]   "because you'll end up having to throw granny down the stairs."
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.120]   This is a lie, and yet it is the way
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.100]   our federal government has operated for the last 30 years,
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.760]   and nobody on either side of the political aisle,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.260]   nor any of the current candidates,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.500]   will take this issue on.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.100]   The reality is that Medicare and Medicaid
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.400]   in the last two years have been growing in expense
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.940]   at a rate of about 9%.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.220]   There was a very short-lived low in that
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.220]   about four years ago in that growth rate,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.280]   which led a whole lot of political pundits
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.120]   to claim that the problem had been solved
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.620]   and that basically we were saved
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.100]   and everything was going to be fine.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100]   But this year, we are back on that track,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.560]   and through June, which is the last month
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.940]   that we have numbers for at this point,
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.200]   numbers of 8.8, I believe, 8.7 or 8.8,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.240]   which is indistinguishably,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.540]   you know, the same statistically as 9.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.620]   At this rate, the spending on that program
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.020]   will go from $1,300 billion, that's $1.3 trillion,
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.720]   which was last fiscal year,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   to $1,800 billion before the next president's term ends,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   first term.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.400]   At that point, we will be blowing a $400 billion a year
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.560]   additional hole in the federal budget
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.000]   because the growth of revenue last fiscal year
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.500]   was only 1.68%.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.400]   - So, Carl, a lot of our listeners
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.440]   are gonna be familiar with the law of 72,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.920]   so at 9% growth, I'm just throwing some numbers out there,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.720]   that means spending will double in eight years
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.820]   if that trajectory continues.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.280]   So in eight years, presumably,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.920]   this takes up 70-some percent of the federal budget?
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.060]   That just can't happen.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.960]   - In 10 years, it takes up more
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   than all of the federal budget.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.760]   And no, that can't happen.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.100]   - So what are we gonna see from here?
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.240]   I mean, are we headed for more money printing,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.440]   more quantitative easing?
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.480]   Are we headed for a major economic reset?
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.100]   What's the end game here?
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.440]   What are the possibilities?
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.180]   - Well, money printing does not solve the problem
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.280]   because you can print money, but you can't print value.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.180]   Okay, so what has to be understood here
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.020]   is what you're doing here is transferring value
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.660]   from one person to another.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.120]   The people to whom the value is being transferred
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.760]   is the medical and insurance complex.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.900]   People love to rail about, for example,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.900]   the Aetna situation where they attempted to buy Humana.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.240]   The government came after them and said,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.080]   "No, that will tend to lessen competition."
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.280]   And then they said,
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.980]   "Well, we're losing all the Obamacare exchanges."
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.240]   And they had warned the government
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.480]   they were going to do this.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   The problem is that Aetna and Humana together,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.020]   it's $110 billion worth of revenue
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.960]   between both of those companies.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   So if you have a $1,300 billion annual expense line item,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.400]   and you have two companies that have
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.000]   a combined operating margin that's in the 9%, 10%, 12% area,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.640]   but their revenue, the total amount of money they take in
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.740]   is only $100 billion.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.500]   This is absolute nonsense to claim
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.800]   that this is somehow responsible for the issue.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.700]   And yet these are two of the larger
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.080]   health insurance companies in the United States.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.040]   The problem isn't there.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.240]   The problem is that we have firms like Mylan
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.020]   that take a product that costs $20
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.780]   over the counter in France,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.520]   and turn it into a $300 product in the United States
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   because they have no competition.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.760]   And they do that by getting laws passed
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.600]   that prevent you from flying to France,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.300]   filling up your suitcase full of these things,
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.860]   and bringing them back and selling them for $30,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.140]   which would be a 50% profit.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.600]   But if you try to do that, you go to prison.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   And there is a body of law that's over 100 years old,
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.280]   15 United States Code, that says that any act
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.480]   that is undertaken by persons
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.320]   with the intent of restraining trade,
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.660]   fixing prices, or creating monopolies,
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.480]   is a federal felony.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.020]   It's not a fine.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.020]   It's 10 years in jail.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.160]   But we have never, never in the history that I can find,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.620]   indicted a drug or pharmaceutical or hospital management
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.640]   or a healthcare manager or a health insurance executive
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.360]   on these charges.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.240]   - Well, if you're just joining us,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   we are chatting today with Mr. Carl Denninger.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.940]   Carl is the prolific author.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.340]   You can read his work at market-ticker.org.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.540]   His latest book is also "Leverage,
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.780]   How Cheap Money Will Destroy the World."
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.820]   So Carl, it seems to me that being a free market capitalist,
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.820]   I often joke I'm a libertarian capitalist,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.100]   there's probably four of us left on the planet now.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.620]   It seems to me that just some free markets
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.700]   probably fixes this problem.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.600]   - Free markets fixes the problem immediately,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.460]   because if you could fly to France and fill your,
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.080]   for that matter, any other country than you,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.380]   where you can buy Epipens without a prescription,
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.220]   they're over the counter.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.840]   If you could do that and go to France
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.060]   and fill your suitcase full of them and come back,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.860]   you could sell them at a tidy profit,
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.860]   and Mylan would sell exactly zero of them for $300
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.260]   when anyone could buy one from you for 30.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:23.140]   The pricing disparities that exist across all of medicine,
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.400]   it's not just pharmaceuticals.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.140]   Pharmaceuticals happens to be the really easy one
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.500]   to go after, but it's not just there, it's everywhere,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.100]   is an outrage, and the only reason it exists
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.420]   is because laws and regulations have been put in place
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.220]   at the behest of this industry
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.780]   to prevent you from doing exactly that.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.460]   So if we solve this problem, if we just said,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.920]   "Okay, look, if you guys can either cut this out
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.560]   "and voluntarily agree that these are all going to go away,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.920]   "and if you don't, we're going to start
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   "putting people in prison,"
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.260]   then the cost of medical care in this country
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.600]   would come down by anywhere between 50 and 80%.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.940]   50% if we went to a socialist system,
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.640]   because that's about what they spend
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.140]   as a percentage of GDP in socialist countries,
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.480]   but capitalism is more efficient than socialism
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.280]   because you have competition.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.240]   So if we were to actually bring competition
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.560]   back into the game, we'd see a decrease of about 80%,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.400]   and if you take bills that you can find,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.900]   and I have a few of them people sent me,
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.660]   for things that people had done in hospitals
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.900]   30 years ago, 40 years ago, for example, birth of a baby,
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.780]   you would find, and you inflate that by the CPI,
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.240]   you would find that you could go to a hospital
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.740]   and have a baby for, eh, $900,
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.140]   and today, it's 10 times that much.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.720]   So the 80% reduction is not fanciful at all.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   It's probably about where you actually see things end up.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.660]   - Well, Carl, we've got just a couple minutes left
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.000]   in this segment.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.700]   Do you think this will ever happen?
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.900]   I mean, when you look at where the political contributions
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.000]   come from, it comes from big banks
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.800]   and financial institutions, one,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.380]   and it comes from pharmaceutical companies, number two.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.380]   So I would assume that it is not a surprise
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.140]   that that's the fact.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.560]   - Well, that's the fact, but there's nowhere in those laws
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.660]   that says that these actions are exempt
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.660]   from the antitrust statutes.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.340]   So of course, go ahead and suggest to anyone
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.800]   in the political sphere that some indictments
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.740]   ought to be issued tomorrow, and you're gonna be met
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.140]   with guffaws and all sorts of things like this.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.620]   The problem is, from a political point of view
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.280]   and from an economic point of view,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.420]   if we don't do this, the federal government's budget
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.320]   will collapse, and when you take what the Federal Reserve
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.760]   has done with tampering with interest rates
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.720]   and you add on to that the impact on bond ladders
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.900]   and pension funds and other defined benefit plans,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.300]   not only will the federal government's budget collapse,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.460]   but the pensions of every firefighter, teacher,
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.400]   and police officer, all state employees,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.580]   are going to go with it within the next 10 years.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.820]   So we either do this, or you're going to have
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.780]   literal destruction of a huge swath
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.280]   of the people in this country.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.260]   - Well, our guest today is Mr. Carl Denninger.

[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.720]   - Welcome back to the Everything Financial Radio program,
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.820]   brought to you by PLP Services.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.360]   My guest today is Mr. Carl Denninger.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.720]   Carl's book, Leverage, How Cheap Money Will Destroy the World,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.900]   his blog, you can read at market-ticker.org.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.500]   Carl, I want to pick it up in this segment
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.840]   where we left it off in the last segment.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.440]   You had talked about the fact that within the next 10 years,
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.240]   if we don't fix this problem, pensions will collapse.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.780]   It'll affect many, many public workers.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.180]   I mean, we've already seen the beginning of that.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.060]   To what extent, as you mentioned briefly,
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.520]   has Fed policy with low, artificially low interest rates,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.120]   with quantitative easing programs,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.200]   driven this problem, and in what way?
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.400]   - The Federal Reserve has exacerbated the problem.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.640]   They, of course, have nothing to do with antitrust law
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.100]   and whether or not it's enforced,
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.680]   but what they have done is destroyed the return
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   that bond investors can earn in reasonably safe securities,
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.420]   especially on the longer duration paper.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.620]   And why this becomes important to people,
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.960]   and even though the majority of the people
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.520]   that listen to your program probably have
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.960]   absolutely nothing to do with buying
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.100]   these kinds of instruments on their own,
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.100]   is that by law, and just by common sense,
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.540]   any company that has an actuarial kind of exposure,
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.200]   in other words, a pension company, you retire at 65,
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.000]   the actuaries say you live to be about 85,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.880]   so they have about a 20-year exposure
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.380]   where they have to pay benefits to you.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.880]   And in order to match that duration of expected expense,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.720]   they build a portfolio of laddered bonds.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.960]   So one piece of them, 120 of them, comes to maturity.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.120]   This year, another 20th comes to maturity.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.520]   Next year, and on and on throughout the expected duration.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.840]   When the Fed tampers with interest rates,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.160]   as they have done, and depresses them,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.760]   what happens is that in the first year,
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.380]   5% of your portfolio gets replaced with bonds
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.880]   that yield much less than they should.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.280]   And that doesn't look so bad,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.680]   'cause it's only 5% of your portfolio,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.220]   but the yield on those certificates might be cut in half
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.680]   from what it otherwise would have been.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.080]   So you say, well, you know, okay,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.680]   so we go from a 6% yield to a 3% yield,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.960]   and that's pretty bad, that's a 50% cut,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.600]   but it's only 5% of the portfolio,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.720]   so it's a tiny little piece, it's a 20th, okay?
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.840]   And it doesn't really hurt all that much,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.960]   it's a few percentage points.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.880]   Unfortunately, what you've just done is built a loss,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.520]   a permanent reduction over the next 20 years
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.360]   into your cash flow, because if the Fed
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.980]   was to stop doing this tomorrow,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.200]   all of those bonds that had been bought
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.640]   over the last seven, eight, nine years
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.660]   would still be in the portfolio.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.760]   And because you could buy a new bond at a higher yield,
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.600]   what that means is that the trading price
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.520]   with existing ones immediately falls
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.440]   to compensate for that forward projection.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   So the pension manager can't sell the old ones
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.880]   and replace them, because they just crystallize to the loss.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.960]   He's stuck with the next, you know,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.400]   however long his maturity is,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.920]   if he's got a 20 year duration,
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.840]   he's stuck with it for another, you know, 14 years,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.600]   where he's going to be earning this sub-return
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.400]   that is less than what he projected
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.760]   and less than what he needs.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.800]   The longer this goes on, the worse it gets.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.520]   And we are now about halfway through
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.920]   most of these fund managers' duration ladder
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.560]   in terms of the distortion that the Fed has put on.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.820]   This is not something that was just a one or two year thing
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.480]   for an emergency, they've now been doing it
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.080]   for, I guess, since 2007.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   And so we are in a situation today
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.560]   where pension fund managers have a critical
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.540]   and growing funding problem
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.120]   into the back of a ramping cost
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.240]   that is running in excess of 9%.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.560]   Now how are you going to make those two numbers match?
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.400]   You're not.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.080]   - Well, if you're just joining us,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.360]   we're chatting with Carl Denninger today.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.120]   Carl is the author of "Leverage,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.580]   "How Cheap Money Will Destroy the World."
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.520]   And Carl, we've got about three and a half minutes
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.680]   left in this segment.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.640]   Moving ahead, what do you expect Fed policy will be?
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.880]   Are they in a situation where they're going to continue
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.720]   to raise interest rates, or is that just a bunch of talk?
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.500]   - I don't know.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.320]   You know, there's this old problem
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.840]   about taking pain now to avoid worse pain later.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.260]   Nobody wants to do it.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.520]   The impact on pension funds is easily projectable
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.960]   and predictable, and it's a function of arithmetic.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.680]   The impact on the budget, however, is tomorrow.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.160]   If the Fed was to lift rates materially,
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.280]   the interest on the $17 trillion in national debt,
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.600]   most of which has been rolled down into the short end,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.120]   which is a horrible thing for the government
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.920]   to have done, but it's what they did,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.380]   is going to spike.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.400]   And the relatively small amount of interest expense
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.460]   that we have today will double or triple.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.320]   So in order to avoid a calamity,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.680]   you'd have to somehow find a way to get rid
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.260]   of the federal budget deficit at the same time.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.360]   And again, the only way to do that,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.960]   the only place that there's enough money to do it
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.880]   is to go after the medical side.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.720]   So will the Fed lift rates?
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.360]   They should have done it a long time ago.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.920]   I think they're going to be forced to do it eventually,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.240]   but my fear is that they're gonna sit on this decision
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.320]   for another few years until it gets to the point
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.640]   that we have a fiscal crisis,
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.040]   not just at the government level,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.480]   which is potentially manageable,
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   but throughout the private sector as well
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.080]   at a degree that nobody's going to be able to cover.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.640]   - So Carl, what does all this mean
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.400]   for currencies around the world?
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.800]   Every currency around the world now is a fiat currency,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.280]   and certainly, when you look at what's going on
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.840]   in Venezuela, look what's going on
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.280]   in many parts of the world.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.480]   You know, there's certainly a lot of stress on currencies
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.360]   and a lot of price inflation.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.120]   Are we gonna see the same thing here?
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.180]   - I don't know.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.360]   The thing that I think is always so interesting
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.800]   is everyone gets all amped up
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.440]   about currency differentials and such,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.840]   but at the end of the day,
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.080]   it really doesn't matter how many dollars
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.960]   you have in your pocket.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.660]   What matters is what they buy.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.700]   And so what people really ought to be talking about
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.700]   is value, not dollars or pesos or francs or euros or yen,
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.980]   and yet everyone wants to try to play
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.760]   this beggar thy neighbor devaluation game
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.640]   to attempt to tip the trade balance in their favor,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.320]   and yet what no one ever wants to deal with
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.200]   is the fact that this is a zero-sum game.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.480]   That which you get in one place
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.660]   has to come from somewhere else.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.720]   So we're focusing in the wrong place
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.760]   as a society and at a policy level,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.200]   but this is just the discourse that we have
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   within the political and economic sphere today.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.680]   I don't see an end to it anytime soon,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.400]   but what I am very concerned about
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.680]   is that if you see something get out of control
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.740]   in the United States,
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.300]   you could very easily see a quarter of the wealth
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.820]   that people have vaporized in the space
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.980]   of a couple of years.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.940]   That wouldn't be hard to imagine happening at all.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.860]   - Well, we're gonna have to leave it there.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.780]   Our guest today has been Mr. Carl Denninger.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.620]   His book, "Leverage, How Cheap Money Will Destroy the World."
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.100]   I'd encourage you to pick it up.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.340]   Carl, thank you for joining us.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.300]   - Anytime, thank you.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.020]   - We'll be back after these words.

[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.000]   You know, we offer a number of resources
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.820]   to help you make good decisions
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.340]   about what to do with your money.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.900]   And in particular, we have a resource
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.260]   that will help you get some perspective
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   on the best way to maximize your social security benefits.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.500]   In today's low yield environment,
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.000]   these decisions have never been more important.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.380]   In fact, when you take a look at 10 years ago
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.460]   and the types of yields you could get on your money
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.200]   and the yield you can get today,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.900]   if you could get an extra three, four, five, 10,
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.960]   or even $12,000 from social security every year
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.860]   by learning how to maximize your benefits,
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.420]   think about how much capital you'd have to have
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.980]   at today's low interest rates to do the same thing.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.660]   With that end in mind, we'd like to invite you
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.440]   to attend one of our free
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   social security maximization workshops.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.200]   We've got one coming up on Thursday, September 8th
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.880]   at Stonewater Country Club out in Caledonia Township.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.580]   Also have one at Boulder Creek Golf Club
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.600]   out in Belmont on Tuesday, September 13th.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.100]   Both events begin at 6 p.m. and conclude at 7.30 p.m.
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.740]   with a complimentary dinner.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.020]   The meeting is free, the information is free,
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.300]   and dinner is free.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.060]   Consequently, they fill up quickly.

[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.020]   returning guest Joshua Sheets.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.500]   Joshua is the host of the very popular podcast
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.700]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.560]   And Joshua, welcome back to the program.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.940]   - Awesome to be back with you, Dan.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.340]   - Well Joshua, let's start by talking a bit
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.500]   about a topic that you discussed on your podcast of late
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500]   which caught my interest.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.540]   And it's how to live a rich life now.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.420]   And the subhead was most material riches
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   are easily accessible to you today.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.060]   Now that's a very compelling and provocative topic.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.380]   So let's spend a little time discussing it.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:19.220]   And maybe to get started, define if you would, rich life.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.980]   I think that maybe has a little bit different definition
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.980]   for just about anybody that hears it.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.220]   - Yeah, it definitely does.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.400]   And that's actually one of the major points
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.140]   that I try to bring out in my podcast
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.940]   is to get people to define it for themselves.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.700]   So I have some definitions that are important to me.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.140]   And I have some definitions that I think
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.940]   are worth other people considering.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.980]   But I want people to think,
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.640]   what does a rich life mean to me?
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.660]   And what I'm confronting is, especially for you and me,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.820]   is in the mainstream financial planning culture,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.500]   we have this tendency to talk about riches
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.620]   and living a rich life as something that happens
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.200]   a long time in the future when we're old and gray
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.420]   and retired and when we have millions of dollars.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.300]   But I look around and I recognize
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.980]   that it's a lot easier to get there now
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.300]   than it is to wait until we're old and retired.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.300]   And I think oftentimes we miss the aspects of riches.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.220]   One of the things that many of my listeners
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.580]   and many of my clients when I was working
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.100]   as a financial advisor would talk about
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.580]   was the aspect of financial freedom.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.820]   And one of the things that I learned
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.740]   was that financial freedom to most people
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.900]   isn't best represented by a brand new Mercedes
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.180]   in the driveway or a big, fancy luxury home on the water.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.020]   Financial freedom is usually represented by choices.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.680]   And I came to the conclusion that you could get there,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.000]   meaning you could get to a place of having control
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.340]   over your choices much faster than you could get
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.400]   to the position of being a multimillionaire.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.220]   You just make different life choices.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.140]   So I break living a rich life down
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.500]   into material aspects and immaterial aspects.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.880]   But just as an example, I think most listeners
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.860]   of your radio show or my podcast
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.620]   are already living a richer life today
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.060]   than the richest person in the world 75 years ago.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.980]   Just think about it.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.220]   Number one, climate controlled.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.060]   Almost all of our listeners right now
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.740]   are listening to us in a climate
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.700]   that's perfectly suited to their ideal body temperature.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.640]   Whether it's cooled or heated,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.060]   they're already enjoying that.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.580]   Think about how hot it would have been
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.980]   for the richest person in the world 75 years ago
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.220]   or how cold it would have been in some places
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.780]   and how much easier we have it.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.880]   And yet when's the last time you heard somebody
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.380]   express appreciation for the simple comfort
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.820]   and convenience of a climate controlled environment
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.900]   or think about the access to information
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.100]   and education and entertainment.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.340]   Today, every one of our listeners
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.660]   has a smartphone in their pocket
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.620]   or sitting on their car dashboard
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.220]   that has access to entertainment,
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.180]   unlimited amounts of entertainment
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.060]   for essentially free right on YouTube
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.740]   from all around the world.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.860]   That's a luxury that the richest person in the world
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.340]   didn't have access to even 50 years ago.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.940]   And yet today we take it for granted
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.780]   and we grumble about the fact that our car isn't brand new
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.100]   while we have access to some of the riches
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.920]   that you couldn't even achieve 50 years ago.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:13.180]   - So when you mention financial freedom
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.060]   and define that by saying control over choices,
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.780]   could you expand on that a bit?
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.460]   - Sure.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.420]   I think that, and on my show I've done,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.780]   I did the immaterial aspects of riches
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.020]   and the material aspects.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.500]   And I like to disconnect them
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.980]   because we are so stuckered in to a losing game
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.500]   by the advertising media on all sides
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.140]   that causes us to think that we somehow need
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.300]   a lot of material things to be rich.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.140]   But if you actually think about it,
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:49.020]   the feelings of richness are often evoked by your choice.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.540]   I can live a rich life by having an afternoon free
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.820]   from work that I don't wanna do
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.500]   to sit and read a book or watch a movie
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.740]   or do something that I do wanna do.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.740]   And so what I think people want from being rich is control.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.820]   They want control over their day.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   They want control over their time.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.900]   They want control over the choice of their activities.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.560]   Well, that can be achieved
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.200]   without yet becoming a multimillionaire.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.240]   If you want control over your day,
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.900]   then transition from a job or a career
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.660]   that doesn't allow you that control
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.020]   to something that does allow you that control.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.500]   I'm 31 years old and my birthday
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.760]   was just a couple weeks ago.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.780]   And I consider myself at this point in time financially free.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.620]   Why?
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.460]   Because I'm a multimillionaire?
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.300]   No, I'm not there yet.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.140]   I'm working towards it, but I'm not there yet.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.220]   But I consider myself financially free
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.500]   because I left a career and job
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.620]   that had a tremendous amount of control
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.940]   and I started my own business
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.940]   that gives me full control over my day.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.340]   I can start my day at any time that I want.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.740]   I can do the work that I've chosen to do.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.980]   I don't accept a lot of external calendar appointments
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.280]   on my schedule, so I have control over when I do my work.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.820]   And that gives me a tremendous amount of freedom.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.380]   Now, it's not the freedom that's ultimately best enjoyed
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.780]   by having a stream of dividend income
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.460]   from publicly traded companies
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.300]   that's much higher than my expenses
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.440]   that I can just sit back and do nothing.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.620]   I still need to work.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.860]   But having that control to choose work that's meaningful
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.100]   makes me feel financially free.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.860]   At the end of the day, we all know
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.620]   that life is composed primarily of our experiences
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.420]   and not so much our things.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.380]   When we're dead and gone,
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.540]   our things are gonna stay here with us.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.940]   We can't use them anymore.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.860]   And most people, when they get to the end of their life,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.300]   they're gonna be much more concerned
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.820]   with their experiences,
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.880]   the richness of their relationships,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.660]   the diversity of their experience,
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.460]   the richness of life
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.620]   that's not just measured by material things.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.900]   - So essentially, Joshua,
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.780]   financial freedom is somewhat time freedom.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.660]   And in your case, as I was listening to you explain
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.460]   or describe your personal transition
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.860]   going from a job to a business,
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.500]   that's probably something that many of our listeners
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.740]   envy very much.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.540]   Can you talk about how you would go about
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.180]   planning such a transition?
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.300]   The key thing is to first recognize
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.940]   that it's something that you actually want.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.540]   Many people have ideas and dreams
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.100]   about how great running their own business is.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.860]   And then those ideas and dreams
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.980]   can be shattered by actual experience.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.300]   I think every business owner has had the opportunity,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.460]   has had the thought at some point
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.420]   in their entrepreneurship game,
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.260]   man, I wish I could just go back to the world of employment.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.260]   I don't recommend that everybody become an entrepreneur.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.860]   It's tough, it's challenging.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.320]   So be sure that it's something that you want.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.820]   The next thing is to recognize
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.220]   there are gonna be some benefits from it
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.340]   and there are going to be some costs and some drawbacks.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.780]   So you need to list those benefits out
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.100]   and you need to recognize what you're giving up.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.660]   But the transition to entrepreneurship is relatively simple.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.220]   You find something that the marketplace is going to value
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.180]   that you want to provide,
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.260]   and then you build a business model behind it
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.260]   that'll work.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.380]   You can also and should also pay very careful attention
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.860]   to some of the formal technical financial planning techniques
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:15.060]   that we teach in order to make it a good transition.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.580]   You can go out and start a business
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.060]   when you're completely broke and deeply in debt.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.540]   It's really stressful.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.060]   Now, if you're in that situation,
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.100]   I recommend you still consider doing it,
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.780]   but it's also very wise
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.100]   to get yourself on a solid foundation.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.900]   I think the best way for most people to approach transition
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.660]   is to do it on a part-time basis.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.020]   Work a full-time job,
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.460]   start a business on the side on a part-time basis.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.460]   That way you're not putting too much risk on the side gig.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.580]   And then when you get to the point in time
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.900]   where you can see some clear and measurable things
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.980]   that you could do to increase the business
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.900]   to a point where it's able to support yourself,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.140]   then go ahead and start pursuing that transition
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.340]   to a full-time business.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:58.700]   - So when we talk about entrepreneurship, Joshua,
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.580]   this becomes a pretty important topic
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.780]   given where the economy is today.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.460]   I interviewed Mr. Gerald Salente of Trends Research Institute
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.380]   and during our interview,
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.180]   he pointed out that actual real income is down
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.980]   for the average American over the last 18 years.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.300]   And even according to the US Department of Labor
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.620]   and the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.500]   median household income is down over the last five years.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   So this is becoming really almost a necessity
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.540]   for some people.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.060]   So if someone has this as an idea,
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.060]   but they don't really have any skills
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.140]   in the area of becoming an entrepreneur,
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   what advice would you give them to go acquire those skills?
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.300]   - The key advice that people in that situation need
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.380]   is a change of mindset.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.620]   You're right about the trends in our economy
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.420]   and it's only gonna get worse in the future.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.900]   We've been done a disservice as a society
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.420]   wherein we've primarily been taught the concept
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.820]   that if you just get a good job, everything will be fine.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.260]   But there are a number of pressures and stresses
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.580]   that are collaborating to make that no longer the case.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.020]   If you notice how many of the unemployment roll,
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.420]   how many of the employment, the jobs,
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.380]   did many of them disappeared after the 2008 recession,
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.100]   many of those jobs have not come back and will not come back
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.700]   and the pressure is only gonna get more and more intense.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.780]   I pay a lot of attention
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.460]   to the developments of automation.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.940]   And frankly, I feel very, very bad.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.900]   I feel bad for many of the people who are working hard,
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.420]   for example, the fast food industry,
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.460]   striking and trying to pressure for what they call
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.740]   a living wage, increases in the minimum wage.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.500]   The problem with that type of approach,
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.580]   the problem with striking for more money
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.860]   is that employers are consistently looking
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.220]   to remove your job and to transfer that
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.260]   to some sort of automated system.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.820]   And I would guess within about five years,
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.580]   most of us will be completely accustomed
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.220]   and comfortable with ordering our food through a computer
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.020]   instead of through a person.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:05.340]   So the key mindset is not looking to say, what can I get?
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.460]   That's the mindset that leads to me striking and advocating
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.340]   and trying to get people to give me more money.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.740]   I'm looking for what I can get.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.420]   The mindset of an entrepreneur is looking to,
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.340]   what can I give?
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.940]   What service can I provide?
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.580]   And so the first thing to do is to look around where you are
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.260]   and try to see what is something
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.220]   that I have the capability to offer to somebody else
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.380]   that they might be willing to pay me for.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.900]   That's the fundamental transformation of entrepreneurship.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.660]   Now, if you don't know, just look around
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.180]   and see what other people are doing
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.380]   and ask yourself, can I do what other people do?
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.060]   And you can do this at any level.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.860]   For example, a couple of neighborhood kids
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.260]   in my neighborhood, they've been off on summer vacation
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.380]   over the last few months.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.100]   And they started a car washing business.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.380]   And there's three young men, eight years old, one,
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.820]   nine years old, the other, and 10 years old, the third.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.660]   And they came by my house, knocked on my door,
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.740]   and asked me if I wanted my car washed.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.220]   They had a bucket ready to go.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.500]   They're using my hose, their bucket, their soap,
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.780]   and they're washing my car for me.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.580]   Well, they've gone and they've created
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.940]   a little tiny business simply based
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.620]   on going around and asking people,
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.740]   would you like me to wash your car?
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.700]   That's the fundamental basis of entrepreneurship
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.620]   of every kind.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.020]   You're just looking for something
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.940]   that people might be willing to pay you for
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.740]   and then asking them, would you be willing to pay me?
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.140]   Now, the good way to start is with something
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.660]   that you have the skills and capabilities of doing.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.900]   An eight-year-old young man is probably not
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.820]   going to have the capacity to do comprehensive financial
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.140]   planning like I do.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.740]   But his business is no different than mine.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.220]   And if you find an area where you
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.860]   think you might have a product or a service
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.340]   that somebody might be willing to buy, you offer that.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.840]   You put that out in the marketplace
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.420]   and you see if there's any interest.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.100]   Then you go back and you try to develop additional business
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.500]   and some services behind it.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.140]   Car washing business, I kind of took these young guys
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.600]   under my wing and I'm trying to counsel them and give them
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.780]   some additional ideas.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.340]   Here are some additional products that you can offer.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.620]   You're offering a basic wash, but what about a basic wash
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.500]   and a vacuum?
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.980]   Well, we don't have a vacuum.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.140]   So you need to go out and get a vacuum, acquire the tools,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.900]   build the skills.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.260]   That skill is pretty simple.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.380]   What about some other skills you can offer?
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.460]   Can you wax cars?
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.660]   We don't know how to do that.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.020]   Well, go learn the skills.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.100]   I'm using a simple example because I
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.140]   think it's something that we can all relate to.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.300]   And today, if I lost all of my money,
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.420]   if I lost all of my business, I would go and now consider
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.100]   starting a car washing business.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.620]   Because that's something that I can go and I can sell.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.620]   I can go door to door.
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.660]   I can ask people if they'd like their car washed.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.420]   And I could build a business on it.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.620]   There are tons and tons and tons of these
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.700]   all throughout our society.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.280]   And if you just start paying attention
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.860]   to what's something I can provide to the marketplace,
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.780]   then your mindset will open up the opportunities to you.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.060]   Well, we are chatting today with Joshua Sheets.
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.540]   Joshua is the host of the popular podcast,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.380]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.700]   I'll continue my conversation with Joshua.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   When everything financial radio continues, stay with us.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:04.700]   (SINGING) Money, money, money, money, money, money.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.220]   This is the Everything Financial radio program,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   brought to you by PLP Services.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.940]   Today, we are listening to an interview
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:18.620]   that I conducted with Mr. Joshua Sheets a while ago.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.220]   This aired back about two months ago.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.020]   But Joshua's got such a great perspective,
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.100]   I thought I would share it with you once again.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.940]   So I'll get back to that interview now.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.580]   I have the pleasure of chatting today with Joshua Sheets.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.100]   Joshua is the host of the podcast, Radical Personal
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.740]   Finance.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.660]   I would encourage you to check it out.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.180]   And we're chatting today with Joshua about how
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.260]   to live a rich life now.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.620]   And on your podcast, Joshua, you talked about the fact
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.300]   that it's possible to build a plan
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.980]   to achieve financial freedom in 10 years.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.460]   So the floor is yours.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.940]   Our listeners, I'm sure, would love to hear that.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.260]   This show, I just finished this series of three shows
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.420]   on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.060]   And it came because I've done over 350 episodes
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.740]   of the podcast.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.860]   And the tagline of my show is how to live a rich life
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.500]   now while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.300]   in 10 years or less.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.620]   And I've done hundreds of shows.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.500]   I never had fully explained that.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.940]   So that was where I came into this series.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.700]   But I'm convinced that you don't have
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.540]   to wait for a 40-year retirement plan
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.020]   in order to live a lifestyle of financial freedom
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.100]   and that there are many paths to financial freedom.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.180]   Now, notice I'm being careful with my words.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.540]   I'm using the word "freedom."
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.620]   I didn't say 10 years--
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.740]   how to be a multimillionaire in 10 years or less,
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.700]   although I believe that is possible for many people.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.340]   I didn't necessarily even say how
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.700]   to be financially independent--
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.940]   independent of the need to work in 10 years or less,
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.260]   although I believe that is possible for many people.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.780]   I talked about financial freedom.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.160]   And the reason is that in my work as a financial planner,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.180]   I noticed that so many people get so focused on only being
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.340]   financially free when they're 65 years old
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.140]   and have a million and a half dollars.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.580]   But guess what?
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.180]   You don't have to wait until then to experience
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.220]   financial freedom.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.220]   And if you put all of your focus and hope
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.260]   on that future experience, you miss out
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.020]   on some of the aspects of financial freedom today.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.580]   So I cover the basic aspect of financial freedom.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.740]   For example, having your income higher than your expenses.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.820]   If you have your income higher than your expenses,
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.180]   then to a great degree, you are financially free,
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.220]   just simply because you have more money coming in
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.260]   than you need to spend.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.140]   Now, even better, if you could have that income coming in
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.940]   in a way that's ideally suited for you
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.100]   through a job that's appropriate to you
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.180]   or through a business that's appropriate to you,
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.700]   now you've got an even higher degree of freedom.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.500]   If you look at the wealthy, notice the fact
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.660]   that the mega rich don't ever retire.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.060]   Donald Trump's running for president.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.740]   He wants the hardest and worst job in the world,
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.100]   even though he doesn't need it.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.100]   He wants it.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.740]   Well, why is he trying to get one of the hardest jobs
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.420]   in the world when he doesn't need it?
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.340]   Because it's something more than money.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.580]   And if you look at all of the wealthy,
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.100]   you almost never see that they retire.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.940]   Why?
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.180]   Because they've found an occupation that fits them
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.500]   and they're financially free,
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.940]   even though they're still working.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.820]   People don't wait to be a billionaire.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.780]   Just find that occupation now.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.340]   Another aspect, being debt free.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.860]   If you're debt free, that gives you a huge degree
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.540]   of financial freedom, gives you choices over your life.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.020]   And then I also go in and I explain
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.100]   that in 10 years or less, you probably can build a plan
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.420]   for financial freedom, complete financial freedom.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.380]   It's as simple as if you're an employee,
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.020]   if you live on about 30% of your income
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.340]   and save 70% of your income,
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.580]   you can be financially independent in about a decade.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.180]   Well, that's easy?
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.620]   No, but many people can do that and are doing that.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.180]   And you can make a plan in a decade
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.060]   to dramatically increase your income,
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.660]   to decrease your expenses and save a lot of money.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.540]   There are thousands of people all around the US
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.660]   that are doing that.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.340]   If you don't believe me, I'll send you to the forums
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.580]   where they're all interacting.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.700]   Or you can build a plan to build a business.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.100]   If you need to have that multimillion dollar approach,
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.460]   you can build a plan to build a business
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.300]   and sell it out in under a decade.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.500]   Now, is that guaranteed?
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.420]   No, that's difficult.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.060]   Most businesses fail.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.900]   But is it possible?
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.720]   It sure is.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.880]   And so, depending on your financial plan,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.500]   you'll set out different goals,
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.820]   depending on what you're trying to accomplish,
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.980]   and you'll be able to accomplish them.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.420]   But I don't believe you have to wait
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.100]   until you're 65 years old
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.260]   and have $2 million in your 401(k)
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.460]   to enjoy the fruit of a rich life now or financial freedom.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.060]   You can achieve it far faster.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.820]   >> And Joshua, you made just a very basic point.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.180]   In fact, I wrote a book called "Finding Financial Freedom"
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.700]   and I made the same point in that book.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.180]   The first thing you have to do is get to a point
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.180]   that your income is higher than your expenses.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.180]   And it might be interesting to talk about the fact
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.980]   that sometimes it's easier to increase income
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.640]   than it is to reduce expenses.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.740]   >> Absolutely.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.660]   I think they both have their place.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.280]   Expenses, for many people, are so loose and sloppy
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.580]   that that's easier to cut.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.820]   But for many people, they're already being very careful,
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.620]   and all they need to do is adjust their income.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.100]   I remember years ago, I heard,
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.260]   I think it was Zig Ziglar tell a story.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.140]   And Zig told the story about how they had done a test
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.140]   and they put a newspaper ad for a job
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.420]   in two different newspapers
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.300]   in two different major metropolitan areas.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.020]   The ad was identical qualifications,
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:28.980]   description of the job.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.340]   The only thing that was different
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.900]   was that in one ad they offered
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.900]   something like $40,000 a year.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.220]   In the other ad, they offered some six-figure numbers,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.420]   say $120,000 per year.
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.220]   And they got five times the respondents
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:46.180]   for the $40,000 a year job than the $120,000 a year job.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.020]   Why?
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.440]   Was there any difference in qualifications?
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.260]   No, the ad was the same.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.420]   It was just the number.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.380]   And so many people have not investigated
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.020]   how to earn more income,
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.320]   and thus they're walking away
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.360]   from all kinds of opportunities that are available to them
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.300]   in their current job or transitioning to a different job
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.060]   or starting a different business.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.620]   And there's so many opportunities
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.980]   for people to increase their income.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.900]   >> Well, we're going to have to leave it there.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.380]   Our guest today has been Mr. Joshua Sheets.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.820]   He's host of the podcast, "Radical Personal Finance."
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.520]   And Joshua, thank you for joining us today.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.320]   We hope you'll come back.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.780]   >> I'd love to.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.780]   >> Well, before I close today,
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.980]   let me remind you that we do have
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.460]   a couple of free Social Security maximization workshops
