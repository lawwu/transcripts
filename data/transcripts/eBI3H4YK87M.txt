[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   All right.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Now that you're back in action, Jesse, the microphone's back and running.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.800]   What do we got for our second question here?
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   All right.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.800]   Next question.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800]   That's funny.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.060]   Thanks for rescuing me there.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.680]   We have a question from Richard about your business model.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.480]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.600]   This is Richard from California.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.920]   I love the podcast and have read many of your books.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920]   Thanks for all you do.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.880]   I have a question about your business model.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.280]   I'm wondering, I know you have a full-time job as a professor, but you are doing all
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   these activities, writing books, podcasts, speaking, articles for The New Yorker.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.960]   Do you have an overall business model behind this?
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.560]   Is there something that you are mainly focusing on?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   Or are these simply activities that you are doing because you're interested in them and,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.520]   of course, you don't want to lose money on them?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.740]   So I'm wondering, is everything a support to your book publishing, or is there some
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.780]   bigger empire-building plan behind it?
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.360]   Love to hear more, and whatever you can tell us would be appreciated.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.800]   So Richard, there is a plan, and I do think a lot about this, and I tweak and adjust this
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.960]   over time.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.160]   Sometimes I think about what's going on in my writing career.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.280]   I'll use a Jim Collins flywheel metaphor.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.560]   So if you know his flywheel metaphor that was originally introduced in Good to Great,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.200]   you're trying to make your business into a flywheel that it picks up momentum.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.640]   As you go around this flywheel, it turns faster and faster, so it builds upon itself.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.720]   Positive stuff builds upon itself, and that's the key to having something go somewhere interesting.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.200]   And I often think about my writing business that way.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.000]   So at the top of the flywheel, the core thing, the foundation of my writing business is my
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.520]   writing, books and New Yorker.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.160]   And New Yorker was a great simplification of lots of different places I used to write.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.360]   For now, as long as they'll have me, I like the idea of just this is where I focus for
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.400]   the most part my non-book writing.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.680]   So books and New Yorker, blockbuster book releases, attention-catching, beautifully
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.960]   crafted articles.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.680]   That's the core grist for my writing business.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.160]   Mill, I think without that, nothing else really matters.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.120]   Then you're just like an online marketer or influencer or something.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   That's the foundation.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   Okay.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.720]   Then next, if you go around the flywheel, I have this, think of it as like the online
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.240]   platform, the online business, the other online activities that happen.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.660]   So people find their way to these other online activities, which is at this point, primarily
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.800]   my email newsletter, my podcast and the associated videos.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.200]   They find their way there because they've read my books, they've read my articles, but
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.400]   then they go there and we can interact with that audience and build relationships with
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   the audience.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.640]   So we pull more people into that audience who maybe haven't seen my books or haven't
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   read my articles.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.200]   So then we have this online, it's the podcast newsletter video.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   And then that all fuels what I call just my deep life.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.160]   So making my life interesting and as deep as possible, you get flexibility with like
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   the income that these things bring in, the opportunities they bring in, you can make
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.280]   your life more interesting.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.120]   And that actually fuels back into the flywheel.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.840]   And I may have these out of order.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   Let me think.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.400]   I think the way I normally think about it is the books doing really well allows more
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.000]   flexibility and interesting things to happen in my life, makes my life deeper.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.680]   I think it's the way I normally think about it.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.880]   And my life being more interesting and deeper feeds into my online platforms and makes that
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.700]   more interesting because it makes it more interesting to hear from me or to see me.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.160]   And that online platform, as that grows, it allows my books to be bigger, which then fly
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.540]   wheels back around to my life, getting more interesting, I have more options, which makes
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.540]   the platform bigger.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540]   That's the actual way.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.820]   So I had that ordering wrong, Richard.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.580]   So that's the actual flywheel I see.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.340]   So the book fuels a more interesting, deeper life.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.860]   And the more interesting, deeper life fuels the online platform.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.240]   The online platform means the books can be bigger.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.980]   That makes an even bigger, more deeper, interesting life, which makes the platform even bigger,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.380]   which makes the books even bigger.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.700]   That's a classic Jim Collins flywheel.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.980]   And that's the way I think about these things feeding into each other.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.900]   Now, in terms of time, I'm very careful about this.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.500]   So as I've talked about here on the show, I separate writing from non-writing.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.300]   The writing is a core thing and it's seasonal.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.780]   When I'm working on a book or an article, it's getting time.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.380]   There's times where I'm not writing something, but that's a core time that I protect on my
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.940]   calendar and that's at the core of my business.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.020]   The other stuff, the other recording the podcast, writing the newsletter, working on the logistics,
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.540]   right now I try to keep that to roughly like a long half day.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.980]   And Jesse can confirm, it's like roughly a half day.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.260]   I got here today at 1030 and I don't know what time it is now, but I think we're aiming
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.580]   for like 2.30 or we're done here today.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.660]   And so podcast recording, working with Jesse on anything we need to do for the podcast,
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.300]   video, talking to our video people, talking to our sound engineer, like all of that stuff.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   I want to be in basically a half day once a week.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.100]   And that's my fixed schedule productivity setup.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.580]   I want to do the best I can with that half day.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.660]   So I'm very aggressively and ambitiously trying to push things forward, but it has to fit
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.260]   within that, with that confines.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.940]   So maybe it's a little bit of a slower pace than if my whole time was spent on the podcast,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.700]   on the video and the newsletter and all these types of things, but it's still making forward
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.020]   progress and its footprint is contained.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.780]   So I keep that footprint really contained.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.140]   Then there's a few other ancillary income producing things.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.420]   There's talks on my online courses.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.580]   I'm very careful about spending time on those and I don't spend, aggregated over the year,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.900]   I spend not that much time on those.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.900]   Like right now I'm not doing a much talking.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.980]   So new is a busy semester and I had my half days for the podcast, video, newsletter, and
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.660]   I had some writing to do and I knew I had a lot of busy semester, so I'm not doing much
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.660]   talking.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.300]   I just told, I tell my speaking agents, turn off the spigot for now.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.980]   So I've significantly reduced the writing and the online courses, Scott Young and I
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.380]   have two and we release them twice a year and I'll add it when we add new courses, it'll
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.940]   usually be over a summer and we only do that every, God knows not very long.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.820]   One of our courses we built in 2014 and the other we built during the pandemic, but I'm
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.260]   very careful about when I invest time in that and then we do the launches twice a year and
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.260]   that's it.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.300]   So those things are very careful about, I don't want to spend too much time on those
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.300]   things.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.220]   The reason why I spend any time on those things is again, the income feeds into the making
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.940]   your life deeper and making your life deeper makes the platform more interesting, which
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.180]   makes the books more interesting.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.820]   So that's part of the flywheel that those things are like someone running up and giving
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.180]   an extra push to it.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.260]   So that's the way I see it and so just to summarize the key points here is I do have
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.100]   a flywheel, two, writing's at the core of it, three, I'm incredibly careful about the
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.900]   time footprints I allow for the non-writing stuff and that's all very constrained and
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.660]   I don't know what number I'm on now, four or D, I'll just switch the letters.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:47.660]   Really income in this picture is all about flexibility, remarkability, interestingness
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.700]   and not just scorecarding income.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.660]   To me that's it's entirely utility.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.340]   The fact that I make enough money on my books means for example, I don't have to take summer
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.360]   salary from research grants.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.740]   So my summers are mine.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.300]   I pay my own salary so I can do whatever I want.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.060]   I'm not working for Georgetown in the summer and that's really important for me.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.300]   That's money opening up autonomy that allows me to do cooler things.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.980]   The income from this podcast right now, a lot of the income from this podcast goes to
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.380]   making the Deep Work HQ possible, which I think is an interesting part of my deep life,
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.500]   having this HQ and being able to come here and we have different plans for what we want
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   to do with this space.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.300]   That's interesting and deep and remarkable.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:38.620]   That's what I care about, not can I, I don't know, buy a car with podcast money or something
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.620]   like that.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.060]   So that's the other thing I see because I think as my life gets more deeper and interesting,
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.220]   it makes what I do on a show like this or in our videos or my newsletter more interesting.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.740]   And that means more people are engaging with me, which means when I write a book, more
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.740]   people want to write the book and the books generate a lot of money.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.860]   So then we can make the life even more remarkable, more interesting.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.220]   There's things on the table where if I want to take a half sabbatical, for example, or
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.460]   take a, this is insider baseball, but basically when you have a sabbatical, it pays for one
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.980]   semester, but you can spread it over two semesters and take half salary for those two semesters.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:18.860]   And when people do that, it's usually because they're going to like go to Google for the
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.900]   work on research and the company will fill in the rest of their salary.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.900]   But like now I could have the option of doing that and just filling in the half salary with
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.820]   book money and just spending a whole year writing.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.500]   Like those types of things to me are very important.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.380]   Being able to have the summers to myself, those types of things are very important,
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.380]   et cetera.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.320]   So that's the business model, turning that flywheel and everything in that flywheel keeps
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.020]   coming back to making my life deeper, more interesting and more focused.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.420]   Everything keeps coming back to that and everything's aimed at that.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.980]   And as that gets, as that's accomplished more, the rest of the flywheel turns, rest of the
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.740]   flywheel turns more and more.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.300]   And that's the, that's the goal.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   All right, Richard.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.340]   So that's, that's the, the business model.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:09.420]   And and it's earned me literally dozens of dollars, dozens of dollars a month that like
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.320]   I just drink a second cup of coffee, three cups of coffee.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.160]   I don't even have to worry about that cost, man.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.560]   This is with all of our, with all of our podcast money.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   Jesse knows Jesse, you will confirm.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.920]   I have, I have, I have drawn the flywheel on a whiteboard for you before you've, you
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.680]   know, I talk about the flywheel quite a bit.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   The scary thing is what's going to happen if the flywheel keeps picking up speed.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.360]   If it all comes back to like making my life more deeper and focused and more remarkable,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.900]   potentially that might lead to some pretty radical things.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.740]   You might have to buy a remarkable tablet.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.740]   That's where it's all.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.840]   The flywheel is all aimed at buying a remarkable tablet.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.300]   Then you can have a life like that.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   That's that.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   That's the story right there.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   Yes, exactly.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.980]   I want to have a remarkable tablet that I, I want to be very well dressed on a balcony,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.740]   looking pensively out over the ocean and then writing poetry on a remarkable tablet.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.740]   That's where this all leads, Richard.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.860]   That's where this all leads.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.360]   So anyways, oh, and let me caveat this all that I'm very bad at business.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   And so don't use my, don't use anything I'm saying as like an example of how you should,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.440]   how you should run things because I have negative business instinct.
