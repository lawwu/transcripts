[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - Tim Keller is the founder of Redeemer Presbyterian Church
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.300]   in New York City, and he's the author of many helpful books,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.200]   including one on work and vocation
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.080]   that has been very helpful to me.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.040]   It's titled Every Good Endeavor,
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.620]   Connecting Your Work to God's Work.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.060]   I talked with Dr. Keller on the important topics
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.720]   of business, vocation, and calling,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.160]   and along the way we talked to college graduates
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.800]   entering the workforce and to Christians
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.400]   who feel stuck in their jobs.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200]   I began by asking him why it seems
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.040]   that applying a biblical worldview to the workplace
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.160]   seems so slippery, so elusive.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.840]   - Well, I think it's probably because of the fact
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.360]   that the church doesn't have a uniform.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.180]   There's not a consensus on how the church
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.620]   is supposed to relate to culture more generally.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.440]   And actually, there's another book,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.160]   this book Center Church, in which I try to tackle that.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.000]   I don't tackle it in the Every Good Endeavor book.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240]   But basically, you've got very different views
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.580]   on how the church should relate to the culture.
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.480]   It's based on very different views about common grace.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.120]   It's based on somewhat different views
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.120]   about actually the role of the institutional church.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.920]   And because of that, I think the doctrine of vocation,
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.080]   which everybody says, oh yeah, it's really important,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.160]   really important, that all work is a calling from God,
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.600]   and that where work is important,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560]   and that God has to come, you need to bring your faith
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.120]   and God to bear on your work.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.960]   You have to have some important,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.520]   but then the problem is that doctrine of vocation
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.280]   gets caught up in this controversy.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.160]   So people come out, really, since there's no consensus
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.960]   on how to relate to the culture,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840]   there's no consensus on what vocation means.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.400]   - Those are interesting entailments.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.360]   You know, early in the book, you write two sentences
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.920]   that I think are really important to get at
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.100]   sort of what this book is about.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.800]   You write this quote, "A job is a vocation
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   "only if someone else calls you to it
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.620]   "and you do it for them rather than for yourself.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.500]   "Thinking of working mainly as a means of self-fulfillment
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.200]   "and self-realization slowly crushes the person
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.440]   "and undermines society itself."
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.900]   End quote, wow.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.600]   Talk a little more about the corrosive influence
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.320]   of individualism in the workplace.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.240]   - Well, the basic idea, the basic secular idea
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.800]   is that there is no meaning in life.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.960]   We're here by accident.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.600]   There's no overarching, there's no moral absolutes.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.000]   There's no, we weren't put here for a purpose.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880]   But then what most of the folks say,
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   I've seen this in many forums, they say,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.780]   "Well, of course there's no meaning in life.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.240]   "You have to create your own meaning."
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.840]   So I've seen a lot of secular people and atheists say,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.460]   "Yes, of course there's no meaning to life,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.000]   "but that doesn't mean that we can't live a fruitful life
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.560]   "and a happy life, you create your own meaning."
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.360]   Well, now, actually, somebody should drill down on that
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.920]   at some point, maybe I will, and say,
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.720]   "It's impossible to create your own meaning.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   "If you create your own meaning, you don't have it."
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.800]   But basically what they mean is,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.280]   you decide what is right or wrong for you,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.000]   you decide what you think is important,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.040]   and then you live according to that.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   But in that case, there's no calling.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.240]   There's no sense that I am,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.600]   there is something higher than me
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.160]   that's more important than me.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.520]   So you see, if you don't have that,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.920]   then there's no such thing as sacrifice and servanthood.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.320]   Everything you do is selfish.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   Everything you do is selfish.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.680]   And there's also no real hope.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.920]   There's no real hope for the future.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.000]   You just basically are trying to create
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   a little bit of happiness for yourself
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.680]   in this brief span of time that you have,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.920]   but in the end, there's nothing but darkness.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.540]   So when you put those two things together,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.520]   the idea of vocation, and the idea of hope,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.800]   and the idea of servanthood,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.520]   and the idea of sacrifice and unselfishness,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   it all actually depends on there being
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   something more important than you,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.280]   something that's already there, like God.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.760]   So the whole idea of vocation's gone,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.200]   and work is nothing but a way of getting ahead,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.320]   and it is crushing us, I think.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.240]   - Yeah.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.640]   So realities above and outside of us
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.840]   are crucial for love, or everything we do is selfish.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.200]   Like you said, that's a really important point.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.280]   So we do have a God over our work,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.880]   and that means that love for others
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.240]   is really central to the idea of selflessness
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.080]   in our vocation.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.740]   I mean, this is a really practical question,
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.280]   but if a Christian shows up for work on Monday morning,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.920]   and they're irritable towards others,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.240]   and they're grumpy, what's wrong?
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   - Well, in the book I talk about the fact
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.080]   that the gospel is brought to bear on our work
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.440]   in a couple of different ways.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.400]   One of them is the heart.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.640]   One of them is the grumpiness, and the anger,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.800]   and the only doing what I have to do to get by,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.640]   and that means it's a lack of a gospel character.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.120]   The gospel's supposed to make you grateful,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.640]   supposed to make you humble,
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.160]   supposed to give you inner peace,
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.120]   it's supposed to make you generous in your spirit,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.260]   and if you just don't show all those things at work,
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.920]   it means that the gospel hasn't really,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.400]   you're not really letting the gospel change the heart
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.240]   the way it ought to.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.960]   And by the way, in the long run,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   a gospel-changed heart usually makes you
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.280]   a pretty good worker, makes people want to work with you,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.000]   makes people want to be on your team,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.320]   makes employers happy with your work.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.940]   So in the long run, having a gospel-changed heart
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.080]   actually is pretty practical in the field of work.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.600]   I think the first time I heard the phrase God of options
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   was from Mark Dever, he was talking about young pastors
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.440]   who take a pastorate in a local church,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.520]   but they're always half in.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.360]   You know, they're always eyeing a different church,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.160]   always looking for a new church, a bigger church,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.040]   a better church, a better position,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.200]   and so they're not committed to their church
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.560]   and their position now.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.200]   They're sort of half in.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.120]   Yet the Bible calls us to, you know,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.360]   whatever we do, we are supposed to work heartily.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.600]   And there seems to be a common thread
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   with Christians in the workplace
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.640]   who are in their position as well.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.120]   You know, they're sort of half in.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.880]   They're sort of drawn to this, quote,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.860]   God of options idea that they're never all in
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.760]   in one particular job.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.720]   Do you see this as a problem?
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.080]   - Yes.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.720]   Actually, I'm being a little ironic,
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.820]   but what I'd say, just say yes,
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   but your question was well stated, and I agree with it.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.840]   I can just add this.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.760]   People are looking for the more fulfilling thing.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.560]   Very often they say, you know,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.680]   I'd like something that is just a little bit,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.920]   a job that's just a little more exciting to me.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.980]   This job's a little boring to me and better paying.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.900]   I think the Christian understanding of vocation
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.800]   is if you produce a product,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.680]   if you produce something that makes people's lives better,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.480]   even if it's a rather boring process to do it,
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.560]   you're doing God's work.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.880]   You're caring for God's creation.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.760]   You're serving people's needs.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.080]   Why does it have to be so incredibly,
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.060]   why does the process have to be incredibly fulfilling
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.180]   when you know that you are doing something that helps people?
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.800]   And I do think that that's part of what I mean
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   when I say that we've lost the idea of calling,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.720]   and we are looking now at work as ways of fulfillment,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.120]   and that actually in the end crushes you,
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.240]   so you're always half out.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.000]   I love what you wrote in your book.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.300]   On page 36 is one of my favorite lines.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.140]   Quote, work did not come into creation
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.660]   after a golden age of leisure.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.720]   End quote.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.900]   So your work is deeply embedded in creation.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.860]   I mean, this is pre-fall stuff.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.760]   It's glorious.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.720]   It's according to God's good design.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.200]   So this is a parenting question for you,
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.120]   but I think it's one that's relevant to all of us.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.840]   I mean, how do I as a dad teach and train my children,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.760]   my boys I'm thinking of right now, age 11 and seven,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   that they were created to work,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.160]   that it's part of their very humanness,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.660]   that it is deeply embedded into them by their creator?
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.080]   How do I do this as a parent?
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.520]   - Well, you have to get the basic doctrines of creation
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.900]   and fall and redemption,
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.500]   and you have to give it to children at every age,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.180]   but you have to give it in a form
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.300]   that they can handle at that age.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.980]   But I think you have to say
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.420]   that work was put into the Garden of Eden.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.220]   When God had everything absolutely perfect, there was work.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.220]   And that must mean that even though in this life,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.340]   work is often difficult,
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.340]   our bodies break down so work can actually wear us down,
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.320]   our minds and our hearts aren't what they should be
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.800]   because of sin.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.480]   And very often we have trouble paying attention to things.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.060]   But basically in the end, we were made to work,
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.200]   and we're only happy if we do work.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.440]   And you can even say people that don't have work
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.680]   or don't do work in the long run get depressed.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.180]   And the reason why they do that
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.080]   is because we were made for it.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.680]   We were made to find fulfillment in working
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.460]   and being useful to others in that work.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.900]   And I think there's a way of getting that across
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.660]   to 11-year-olds and seven-year-olds.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.980]   You say, the way I raise children too,
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.580]   you say things, you're not sure they get it,
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.180]   you find out in question and answer
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.340]   to what degree they understood it,
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.180]   to what degree they don't,
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.260]   and then you try to make it simpler
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.060]   until you feel like you've hit home.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.140]   - That is so good.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.960]   Thank you, Tim.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.340]   We're gonna stop there and break today.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.140]   We'll return tomorrow and I'll ask you
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.340]   about what we should do when we don't like our jobs.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.420]   What next?
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.540]   And how, if any, is our work connected
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.340]   to the morality of a corporation
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.020]   and related questions when it comes to our jobs.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.220]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhart.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.060]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.060]   Thanks for listening.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:28.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
