[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.540]   Every day in America, the strong murder the weak, and it's legal.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.780]   It's legal for the strong to murder the weak in America because Americans have grabbed for a godlike power
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.020]   to determine what is real and what is not real, who is human and who is subhuman.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.280]   This is a profoundly important point made by Pastor John in his latest Sanctity of Human Life Sunday sermon and
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.320]   in a clip recently sent to us by a listener to this podcast. Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520]   Abortions come from self-deification.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   Deification, what in the world is that? To deify something is to
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.640]   treat it as God.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.960]   Deification is to act as though you're God.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.200]   I can hear
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.240]   someone say, "Oh, here it comes, some
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.720]   over-the-top,
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.840]   overstated,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.080]   fevered, rhetorical, sermonic flourish about our becoming gods."
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.920]   If we're pro-choice,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.440]   you listen and judge if it's fevered.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.440]   In
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.800]   1992, in the case of Planned Parenthood versus Casey,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.960]   the Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.680]   spoke a sentence,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520]   one of the most important sentences uttered in the last 50 years,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.280]   for echoing and shaping our culture. He said,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.120]   "At the heart of liberty,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   is the right
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.280]   to define one's own concept of existence,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.120]   of
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.360]   meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life."
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.160]   That's breathtaking.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.600]   Here's one of the outworkings of that
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.720]   self-deifying worldview.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.160]   Minnesota,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   along with 37 other states,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.840]   have fetal homicide laws.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.360]   You know what that is?
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   Laws about how you can treat a baby in the womb. You can read these just like I did. Just go to
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.920]   Google and type in Minnesota Statutes
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.720]   609-2661 following. These statutes
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   distinguish first degree murder, second degree murder, third degree murder, manslaughter, and assault, all of them relating to the unborn.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.640]   For example,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.440]   Statute 609.2661 says,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.000]   "Whoever does any of the following is guilty of murder of an unborn child
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.680]   in the first degree and must be sentenced to imprisonment for life."
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.000]   One,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.760]   "Causes the death of an unborn child
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.160]   with premeditation and with intent to affect the death of the unborn child or of another."
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.840]   To which you all respond, "That's the definition of abortion."
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:39.120]   "Causes the death of an unborn child with premeditation and with the intent to affect the death of the unborn child."
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.520]   So why doesn't that rule out abortion? It's there in the law.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.760]   Simple.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.640]   609.2661 gives some definitions.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   A,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.120]   "Unborn child means the unborn offspring of
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.920]   a human being
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.000]   conceived but not yet born."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.080]   Amen.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   That's good.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   B,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.160]   "Whoever," I can define whoever, "Whoever does not include the pregnant woman."
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.280]   So in the sentence, "Whoever causes the death of an unborn child
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.720]   with premeditation
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.680]   doesn't include the mom."
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.080]   And then goes right to the chase in 609.269,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.080]   "All these sections protecting the unborn child
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.040]   do not apply," quote, "to any act described in section
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.200]   145.412, which is all about abortion."
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   Oh, okay, so abortion is just an exception.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.520]   Here's the implication. It is illegal,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.720]   Minnesota and lots of states,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.400]   to take the life of an unborn
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.520]   child if the mother wants the baby.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.800]   And it's legal to take the life of an unborn child if she doesn't.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.280]   In the first case, the law treats the fetus as a
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.080]   human with rights.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.520]   In the second case, the law treats the fetus as a non-human with no rights.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   Humanness,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.160]   humanness, the existence of a human being is decreed
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.320]   by the will of the mother.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   The baby is young and weak. It can't cry out, "I'm a human!"
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.000]   Therefore, the will of the older, the stronger,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.600]   holds sway.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.800]   And by her will,
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.000]   she may confer upon the human,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.680]   "You're a human!" or not.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.240]   If she does confer humanness on this thing,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.240]   no one may kill this baby.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.480]   And if she does not confer humanness on this baby,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.560]   it may be legally,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.840]   with impunity, killed.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.640]   That is legally enshrined self-deification.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.480]   The strong decide which of the weak are persons.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.680]   We reject that in the case of Nazi anti-Semitism.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.840]   We reject that in the case of Confederate race-based slavery.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.240]   We reject that in the case of Soviet gulag.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   But in the case of the unborn,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.040]   millions of people, millions in the church,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.040]   which is what I care about most,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.880]   embrace the
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.960]   self-deifying principle
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.360]   the human will of the strong
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.240]   confers personhood.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:26.480]   If she wants the baby, it's a baby. If she doesn't, it's not. She's God.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.560]   Now, according to God's Word,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:39.400]   the baby inside and outside the womb gets its personhood from God.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.440]   This is Psalm 139. "You formed my inward parts,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.360]   you, God, you knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.040]   I praise you for you are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.040]   My frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in the secret,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.120]   intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.880]   Your eyes saw my
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.120]   unformed substance. In your book were written every one of them, the days that were formed for me when as yet
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.680]   there was none of them."
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.600]   God's divine
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   person forming work in the womb is not to be preempted by any self-deifying human being.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.080]   So I say again abortion is caused
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.040]   significantly by
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.440]   human self-deification.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:47.000]   Sobering. That's from John Piper's Sanctity of Human Life Sunday sermons titled "Doing the right thing never ruins your life."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.320]   A belief that prevents abortion. Preached on January 28th, 2021.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:00.040]   The entire sermon, of course, is online right now at DesiringGod.org. This clip was submitted to us by Lauren in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.400]   Thank you, Lauren, for sending us this potent clip. Powerful. A lot to think about.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.160]   If you have a sermon clip, send it in to us.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.880]   Tell us what bits of Piper's sermons have caught your attention and we share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.000]   If you've got one, email me. Give me your name, your hometown, the sermon title,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.360]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.920]   That's an email address. AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well, can an older man marry a younger woman?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.960]   Specifically, can a 48 year old man marry a 24 year old woman? Both are Christians.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.960]   What would you say? We are going to hear from Pastor John because it's a question with a lot to think about.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.360]   And we will when we field this dilemma from a podcast listener next time.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.800]   I'm your host Tony Ranke and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday. We'll see you then.
