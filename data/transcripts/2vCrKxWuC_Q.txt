[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.160]   You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs where we give you insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.800]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about the importance of digital accessibility.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   So what is digital accessibility?
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.840]   For websites, it means that all the content you see and
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.360]   the way that was built is done in a way that makes it usable and
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.080]   accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   Now most websites fall short of this,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   because it goes far deeper than just color contrast and text legibility.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.440]   Now what if I told you your company could be held liable for this negligence, and
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.120]   you could find yourself in the crosshairs of a major lawsuit?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.720]   The goal of this video is to help you be more aware of how to deliver a better user
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.160]   experience to those with disabilities, and to avoid potential legal action.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.720]   Today, we're going to have a conversation with Zach Polwike.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.440]   He's the Director of Client Success at Ability.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.000]   In this video, he's going to talk to us about what is digital accessibility,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.200]   how you are evaluated against WCAG compliance guidelines, and
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.440]   how to protect yourself from lawsuits.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.240]   All right, let's get started.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.080]   Hey guys, today we're talking about web accessibility, and
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.200]   joining us is Zach Polwike, Director of Client Success at Ability,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.360]   a digital accessibility company, how are you doing, Zach?
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.280]   >> I'm really good, Sam, thank you.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.560]   >> Now, Zach, I'm just looking forward to this conversation, because I believe that
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.600]   the topic of accessibility broadly is so important, because it's probably one of
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320]   the few topics where people truly don't know what they don't know.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.720]   And the challenge or problem is that their company can actually be held liable for
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.840]   that negligence.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.960]   And that can be anyone, could be in marketing, product support, or
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.520]   even human resources.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.280]   And being someone who's managed web, the danger is that most of us think that
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.680]   we're doing it, right?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.320]   And by it, I mean being mindful of text legibility over colored backgrounds,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.840]   let's say.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   But the spectrum of the handicapped and disabled is so broad.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.640]   And that's just simply not enough to deliver a good web experience to them.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.360]   And again, a smart or savvy lawyer can take advantage of this and
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.160]   essentially extort your company.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.400]   So Zach, can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing today?
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.080]   How long you've been doing it?
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.040]   And maybe lead us into a conversation about what is accessibility compliance and
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.600]   why is it important to a user and a company?
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   >> Definitely, I can sure can do that.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.600]   So I'm the director of client success at Ability, as you mentioned,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.680]   we're headquartered in the Pacific Northwest of the US in Eugene, Oregon.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.280]   And in a sentence, what our company does is we work with governments and
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000]   businesses around the world to help them achieve their
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.800]   digital accessibility compliance goals.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.040]   And depending on your industry and the regulations that govern the business
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.560]   that you're in, there are slightly different goals.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480]   I was hired number one at this firm actually 14 years ago to the month.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   This is my 14th anniversary.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.040]   >> Congratulations.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.760]   >> Thank you. Thank you.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.840]   My business partner who's our CEO and I have completely bootstrapped and
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.520]   built this agency from scratch, which I'm very proud of.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.560]   Because who we are today is very organic and the growth,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.520]   growing as a bootstrap company is kind of wild.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.760]   That's a story for another day.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   I'm not sure if I would do that again.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.440]   But we're very happy to have landed where we are.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.320]   And digital accessibility is very similar to physical accessibility,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.920]   at least in the spirit of what we're talking about.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.800]   So we know physical accessibility from the Americans with Disabilities Act from,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.720]   I think, 1990, which really stipulated common sense things.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.120]   If your place of business has stairs, for example, to the main door,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.080]   we need to provide an equivalent alternative means for, say, a wheelchair.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.720]   So a ramp or a lift, or if you're at your favorite restaurant and
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   the restroom signs have braille on them.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.360]   These are all manifestations of the ADA Act.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.640]   And so digital accessibility takes that principle and
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.480]   really applies it to things that are ubiquitous on our lives now.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.560]   Our smartphones, websites, the software you use,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.120]   the software you bank with or that you do your taxes with.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.840]   These things are going to be difficult to use to an end user,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   if an end user has any kind of impairment or disability.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.880]   And very briefly to describe what those different types of impairments or
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.600]   disabilities are, is there are spectrums of vision loss.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.400]   There are spectrums of hearing loss.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.640]   There are all different kinds of cognitive impairment from being prone to
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.080]   seizures or needing longer to process information and everything in between.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   And then there's a spectrum of motor impairment.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.240]   So think of paralysis or the inability to use your hands or fingers or
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.560]   limbs to their full ability.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.920]   And then the one that's often forgotten about is temporary injury,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.360]   like an injury recovery.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.600]   Getting out of a radical surgery is going to be months until you're whole again.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   Using websites or apps or software will be challenging unless those digital assets
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.880]   conform or adhere to a very specific set of guidelines.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.040]   And we're going to talk about this today quite a bit.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.760]   There's an acronym WCAG, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.960]   And this is actually one of the few things that is a universal.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.400]   Every human on Earth agrees,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.040]   which is really crazy when you think about how divided we are nowadays.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.680]   Every human on Earth, every government on Earth, every regulatory body on Earth
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.800]   understands and agrees that if we want our assets to be accessible to those with
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.600]   impairment or disability, we need to make sure our assets conform to these WCAG guidelines.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.360]   So companies like mine often play the role of third party arbiter where we'll be
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.200]   hired to audit those assets, identify those weaknesses and those we call them
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.120]   violations against the WCAG and then work with the developers of record or
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.400]   the agency of record to go through rigorous auditing and then remediation
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.320]   to confirm the issues have been fixed.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.400]   And so just to put a bow on that thought,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.440]   once you confirm that your asset adheres to these guidelines and there's no
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   secrecy to them, they're publicly available, they're very well written.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.920]   They're written by people in tech.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.120]   So they're not written by attorneys or like congressmen or congresswomen
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.640]   who usually are attorneys with lofty language.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   It's like Shakespearean takes 3000 pages to say the sun is rising.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.080]   These are very common sense, easy to understand and obtain guidelines that we
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.240]   help people make heads or tails of.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.080]   Yeah, that's a really, really good overview.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.400]   And you're totally right.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.560]   And I appreciate your statement about how it is totally globally acceptable, right?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.120]   Because it's a universal guideline to adhere to and in a world where we're trying
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.200]   to make websites scalable for all languages and regions like one fixed
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.280]   year can fix it all, which is really good to know.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.400]   Can you maybe break it down a little deeper?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   So we talked about the WCAG guidelines.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.680]   I think 2.0 is out now, right?
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.520]   Can you help us understand maybe the key founding, the pillars or
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.800]   principles of which a website could be not necessarily audited,
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.200]   but evaluated based upon?
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.440]   Absolutely, yeah, you nailed on a really important principle there in that this
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   set of guidelines is a living document.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.880]   It gets updated throughout time as technology evolves.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.280]   So we're in a world right now where you're either looking at draft version
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.120]   2.0 or 2.1, they're very similar differences, but that's really what
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.640]   everybody's aiming for right now.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.400]   There's a new draft 2.2 that has been delayed because of COVID,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.600]   but will be published sometime in this calendar year, 2023.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.640]   So the principles, the principles are to ensure that content and
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.560]   the structure of assets.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.280]   So let's use a simple website as an example.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.800]   You know, content are things that change regularly, pictures, text, video,
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.080]   documents available for download, right?
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.040]   And then structure is how the website is built, you know, how the blueprints
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.000]   are laid out, how it is coded, you know, how the menus are built and so forth.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.680]   These parts, these mechanics of, say, websites need to be retrofitted in a
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.080]   manner so that as an end user, I can understand the content.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.520]   I can understand the context that is being presented to me.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.120]   Okay.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.160]   And then I can take action in a meaningful way.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   Now you can imagine as a thought experiment, if I'm completely blind,
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.320]   it will be very difficult for me to understand the context of something,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.280]   unless it is made obvious to me through something that we call alt text,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.120]   not to get into too much how Sausage is made, but it's about making sure that
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.320]   those things are consumable, understandable, and actionable, and adhering to the WCAG
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.360]   guidelines gets you to that finish line.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.120]   - Do you mind kind of showing some examples of maybe the most common
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.520]   violations per each of those principles you called out, right?
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:12.000]   Just so using like a tangible, you know, like learning from you?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.280]   - Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.320]   And we could spend hours here.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.400]   So I'll keep you all you listeners to just the hits for today.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.560]   The most common low-hanging fruit is alt text.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.440]   So, you know, websites and software have tons of image files, you know,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.600]   as part of the design.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.480]   So lots of images, beautiful images, right?
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.320]   Well, if I'm blind, I have no idea what the contents of that image are.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.720]   And so as a blind person relies on an alt text description,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.280]   which is just baked into the HTML, it's hidden to the eyeball.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.360]   But it provides basically a little description to a screen-reading software.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.920]   Let's say if I have an image of, you know, an NBA game taking place,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.080]   the alt text description may say, you know, "The Portland Trailblazers are
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.920]   playing the Oklahoma City Thunder and this image is of tip-off."
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.160]   And so my screen reader will read that aloud to me and I'll say, "Aha,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   I can imagine in my mind what that would be."
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.480]   So that's alt text.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.560]   Then the most important principle, and this gets a little bit more technical
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.160]   because it requires code remediation, but the most important principle
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.960]   of everything, like this takes care of probably three-quarters of the
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:26.040]   guidelines, is everything that is a thing needs to be labeled as such within the
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.640]   superficial markup language of the site, the HTML, so that a screen reader will
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.880]   know what to do with it.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.480]   So anything that is a thing, which is kind of a funny thing, but buttons,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:42.720]   menus, modals, iframes, YouTube embeds, lists, headers, you know,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.160]   anything that is a thing needs to be labeled as such so that when a screen
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.480]   reading or assistive software device finds itself landing on that content,
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.080]   it goes, "Aha, this is a header.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.960]   This is very important.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.680]   I must read this aloud to the blind or impaired person," or, "Aha,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.360]   this is a button and the button says Buy Now," and clicking the Buy Now button
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.800]   takes me to the checkout page.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.840]   You know, these are things that we take advantage of if we have full vision
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.240]   because we are, you know, our brain is processing this at, like,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.520]   trillions of iterations a second.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.640]   But if you don't have the use of your eyes, say, or even your limbs,
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.960]   you know, that becomes very difficult.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.720]   So that's why accessibility is important.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.960]   - Can you give us some examples of maybe tools that the...whether it's
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.680]   a visually impaired or aurally impaired, whatever that spectrum is,
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.200]   like, the common tools or ways that they navigate a website?
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.120]   So you mentioned screen reader earlier.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.560]   Like, is there a specific software people use or is there physical devices?
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.200]   - That's also a great question.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.600]   We can tell Tim's done his research for this conversation.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.760]   - I do my best.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.800]   - The short answer is yes, there's a very specific set of tools that one would use
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.200]   if they have any kind of impairment.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.240]   So first, most obvious is a screen reader.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.400]   So there are really two primary screen readers.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.920]   There are others, but for all intents and purposes, the primary two screen readers
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.200]   that are used by the public is a software called JAWS, which is a paid license to use,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:12.000]   and then a software called NVDA, which is a free software license to use.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.280]   And these are classic screen reader software.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.880]   So if I'm blind or even have physical impairment like a paralysis,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.160]   I'm going to rely on this software that I have installed on my computer to act
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.360]   as my eyes or to act as my fingers on the mouse.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.840]   And the purpose of the software is they will move me through a website,
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.760]   take me through where I want to go and, you know, get me to my end destination.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.040]   Beyond that, we have to remember that we're in an increasingly mobile world.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.560]   You know, many people are never going to visit a website on a laptop or desktop.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.840]   They're only going to be using, say, their iPhone or Android.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.960]   And so those two operating systems have their own built-in screen reading software.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.520]   So I wouldn't necessarily license the software and install it on my phone.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.120]   They have built-in software.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:08.600]   So VoiceOver is the software for Apple devices, and Voice Assistant is for Android devices.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.280]   And those are just in there ready to go when you turn on your phone.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.960]   Yeah, and then finally, beyond that, you know, we get to like edge use cases.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.600]   If I have a certain type of paralysis where maybe I have partial movement in my hands
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.800]   but my fingers aren't working correctly,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.200]   I'm not going to use a trackpad or mouse.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.880]   Perhaps I'm using like a joystick, almost like an old, you know, a gaming system joystick
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.520]   that's, you know, specific for that kind of impairment.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.200]   But that really covers probably 90-plus percent of the people, what I just described.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   Yeah, thank you for that.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.800]   Can you give us some examples, like publicly available information around maybe companies
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.920]   that maybe weren't compliant and maybe whether it's in the process of litigation
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.520]   or they're caught in a major remediation act to retrofit because again, it hits everyone,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.200]   small and large companies, and maybe just kind of talk about that and maybe even share
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.240]   from your personal experience, like maybe individuals that you've known who are impaired
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.720]   and now they've engaged with the website and maybe that experiencing the other end of it
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.200]   where it's now totally user-friendly for them.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.640]   Can you maybe talk a little bit about both?
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.080]   Yeah, yeah, let's start with your first question.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.760]   So, I think it's important to just spend a minute on the legality of this topic specific
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.560]   to the U.S., so this is very interesting.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.680]   It goes back to your high school civics classes and this is where the rubber actually hits
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.280]   the road is we do not live in a democracy.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.180]   Democracy is mob rule, it's 50 plus one.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.960]   We live in a republic and this is where the difference actually matters is we have these
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.160]   three branches of government that have separation of powers, you know, blah, blah, blah, all
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.680]   the things that we heard about in high school civics classes, but what that means in real
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.620]   terms and real application is the judicial branch of our government has to move in real
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.700]   time.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.640]   People are getting sued, people are adjudicating things in real time today.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.880]   Then we have the legislative branch, which, you know, just by definition is always behind
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.880]   the times.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.040]   They have to write laws and then amend laws and then all the political BS that everybody
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.520]   hates has, you got to go through all that and that takes time and so the laws that get
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.240]   written typically get written too late or late, right, and so the judicial branch has
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.680]   to move in real time and so what we're seeing in the U.S. is the precedent has been set.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.880]   This is the policy.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.700]   While Congress has not written and passed a law that says you must adhere to WCHE if
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.760]   you have a business in America, full stop.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.080]   In other countries that is the case, like in Canadian provinces they have much stronger
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.400]   laws on the books, but we have the judicial branch, which has been tried thousands of
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.120]   times with thousands of cases and what the judicial branch of government at every level
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.600]   has decided is, you know, the Americans with Disabilities Act was written really not for
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:01.800]   a digital world, but we can apply the spirit of that to the digital world and the WCAG
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.540]   guidelines are the universal standard, therefore, and here's the punchline, is if you're operating
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:14.360]   a business in the United States and someone calls you out for non-compliance and if it's
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.280]   true and it's typically true, then you lose, even though there's not a law in Congress,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.800]   right, because it's precedent has been set and then, you know, the next time someone
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.400]   gets sued they reference precedent behind that, so that's very important.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.600]   That is the playing field is if you are not doing something about compliance and someone
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.780]   catches you in a pickle, it's very hard to win that case.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.740]   Now, to your other question about, you know, maybe a personal anecdote, a great childhood
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.660]   friend of mine from preschool, who I'm still very close friends with today, was in a really
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.280]   tragic accident in high school.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.300]   He was an all-state athlete, pre-sport, three-season all-state athlete, he was absolutely going
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.720]   to a Division I college to do track and field and he was in a snow skiing accident and broke
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.080]   his neck in senior year of high school.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.700]   And that's a cool success story for another day, but the Cliff Notes version is, you know,
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.540]   he refused to be a victim and he went to college and he got married and has family and has
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   a wonderful career, but we joke all the time how inconvenient it is to be in a wheelchair
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.300]   and to have partial paralysis and he talks all the time about how websites suck.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:31.220]   I mean, that's just his opinion from his perspective, you know, it's very difficult to live and
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.560]   navigate through websites, imagine just trying to do online banking every day.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.040]   If your online banking software is not accessible compliant, I mean, that will ruin your day,
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   you know.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.920]   So, that's where, just personally, when I realized that this is very important, like
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   very important.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.520]   So, anyways, I've been preaching for a long time, so.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.080]   Yeah, I know, I love that, I think it's important to remember, and to your point, there's humans
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.920]   behind these screens, right, and if you're a company and most companies believe and strive
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.560]   to be customer centric, it's not just about the content you put out there, it's how you
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:09.300]   put it, and this is why it's so important, and again, your point about the litigation
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:17.380]   aspect of it, because it's referential almost, like, that means as the guidelines get updated,
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.440]   you maybe, you might have been compliant like three years ago, that may not be the case
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   now, right.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.880]   So, again, because living or breathing is an organic document, like, your web posture
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.240]   has to reflect that, right, and that's why this is so, so important.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.960]   You're never truly safe if someone's got their eye on you, right.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.640]   So, I'm kind of bringing it back to something a little more practical than Zach, so, there
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.120]   are a lot of free web tools out there, and we can, I'll put a link to a few of them,
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.800]   maybe even call some of that on this call, since you're more familiar with that.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.680]   My experience with those is, even if you register for them, the audit is pretty good in terms
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.080]   of giving you a list of things to work on, but it's certainly not comprehensive, and
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.880]   that's why working with someone like you is so important, right.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.640]   Can you kind of maybe help us walk you through the types of free tools people can use today
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.440]   just to do evaluation, because this is highly actionable, but then help us understand what
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.280]   a true audit looks like to you using tools and human, and what that remediation looks
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   like?
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.600]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.440]   This is probably the most important question of today's interview.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.760]   In my industry, there are two ways to identify accessibility problems within a website.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.360]   One is through automated tools, like scanning software, and one is through a more intimate,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.880]   human-led review, human auditing, use case testing, so forth and so on.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.960]   Most people start with automated tools, because they're easy.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.240]   You know, you load in your website's URL, you click a button, and it gives you a report.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.840]   Like most things in life, there are trade-offs, and so we'll talk about those trade-offs in
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.280]   a second.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.920]   But if you're just getting into accessibility compliance and you're like, wow, this is something
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.720]   I should care about, getting started with a scanning tool is a perfectly fine starting
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.260]   point.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.340]   There are a number of softwares, both free and paid, okay.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.880]   My personal opinion is better quality when you pay, but there are some free tools that
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.600]   you could start with.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.320]   Google provides an accessibility tool, I believe it's called Lighthouse.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.160]   It's part of a greater package, but it'll run a scan on your website and start to give
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.520]   you some insights on what needs to be done.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.600]   Color contrast is something that can be found through an algorithmic mathematical means.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.820]   So color contrast scanning tools are very accurate.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.540]   There's one we love by WebAIM.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.160]   It's called a color contrast analyzer.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.680]   It is very simple to use.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.480]   You plug in the hex code of two colors, and it gives you a mathematical output of here
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.960]   is the ratio, and then it even gives you more information of whether or not it passes WCAG
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.520]   2.0 or 2.1, so forth.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.480]   There are a couple of tools that I'm actually gonna recommend that we avoid that are free,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.080]   but I know one is free, one may be paid, but there's a tool called WAV that's a free scanning
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   tool.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:07.400]   There's another one called Power Mapper, and I'm only gonna speak from personal experience.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.320]   Part of our job is to work with attorneys as they're going through accessibility audits
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.760]   with their clients, and we always talk about scanning software.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.320]   And from what we have seen, and we've been doing this a long time, is we really need
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.680]   to be careful about the WAV and Power Mapper scanning tools.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.700]   They often error on the side of false positives.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.800]   So you run a scan with one of those reports, and you're like, "Oh my goodness, I have 15,000
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   issues on my website.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.320]   How is that possible?"
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.140]   And it's quite likely that most all of those are false positives.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   And this is to say nothing bad about software, it's just that there's limitations to what
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.320]   software can find.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.880]   So for those of you using WAV, it's probably the most popular tool.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.460]   So continue to use WAV if that's what you wanna do, but just keep a grain of salt with
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.160]   this, knowing that it may be more inaccurate than you think.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.960]   And why this is not an indictment on any scanning software is the trade-off that I mentioned
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.720]   a couple of minutes ago.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:14.500]   The only way to identify all compliance issues that exist on a site is through human testing.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.580]   Maybe in a decade when AI continues to evolve, it's a different conversation, but right now,
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:25.280]   only human intervention can determine many of these WCAG guidelines.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.940]   And that's because they're just so nuanced and so complex.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:34.460]   So what my company primarily does is, we kind of call it doing it the right way the first
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.040]   time, human-led review, auditing, and testing.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.160]   And it's a multi-discipline approach where we're doing screen reader testing using the
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.920]   software that I mentioned earlier, we're doing mobile reflow or mobile responsive testing.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.160]   We're doing keyboard navigation testing, so that's kind of like, turn off your screen
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.960]   reader, unplug your mouse, and you're only testing using keystrokes on your keyboard.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:03.320]   That's a very challenging one to pass, is you have to have everything dialed in.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.480]   We do technical auditing, which is kind of a multi-dozen point inspection of all unique
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   page templates.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.300]   And then we do random sampling.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.960]   And for good measure, then at the end, we run a website through our own proprietary
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.220]   scanning software, acknowledging that there are limitations to scanning software.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.860]   But that's really the only way to do this the right way.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.160]   And so, for those of you out here who may be considering this as a need within your
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   company, this is what I tell people all the time, if you want to reduce your risk as close
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.920]   to zero as possible.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.600]   If you want to fully comply with those guidelines, if you want to make sure you don't get sued
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.680]   or get sued again, you really need to include human intervention testing and auditing to
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.180]   make sure everything is found.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.700]   So how does a company who's gone through, let's say they've remediated their website,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:57.120]   how can they supply something like a document or certification or verification that they've
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.280]   taken the efforts to be compliant in a way where it maybe removes the burden of litigation
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.640]   or a fault, right?
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.000]   There are two very specific answers to that question.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.640]   The first is that you could have a VPAT document authored for your asset in question, your
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.840]   app, your software, your website.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:30.000]   So a VPAT is Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, VPAT.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.940]   And a VPAT is a universal templated document.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.060]   Every VPAT that has ever authored looks exactly the same.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:40.680]   And a VPAT is a public declaration of the accessibility compliance or lack thereof within
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   your asset.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.600]   It's usually about 10 pages long.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.260]   And the real meat of the document is a table.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.680]   And every row in the table represents one of the WCAG requirements.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.640]   And then in the columns, you declare publicly whether or not that specific guideline is
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:02.360]   applicable to your website or app, whether or not it conforms, and if not, explaining
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360]   why.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.800]   So that's the first document that people will expect to see to verify proof of conformance.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.560]   The second document is something that a company like ours would provide, and we're certainly
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.360]   not the only company that does this in the US, and it's called verification or certification.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.440]   So that's where we, as a third party, are independently verifying on the day of our
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.880]   final review, this asset either meets or exceeds the standards of the WCAG.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.240]   And if there are limitations, maybe you couldn't bring it to full compliance for X, Y, or Z
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   reason.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.400]   We publicly declare, here are the limitations, here's why the limitation exists, and here's
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.480]   our plan on how to address that moving forward.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:49.420]   And then beyond that, I think the next most important thing is that you really need to
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:55.740]   consider an ongoing effort, whether that's automated scans at a cadence, or whether it's
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.080]   having a company like ours audit in a human led way multiple times a year, because your
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   assets change.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.320]   It's like, that's how websites work is they evolve over time.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.800]   So you need to make sure you have a commitment to maintaining compliance over time.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   If you do these things, like these are kind of best practices that I'm giving right now.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.760]   If you do these things, we're reducing your risk of being sued or getting a demand letter
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.080]   by orders of magnitude.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.720]   And it is always the case that however much time or money that you pay to go into this
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.400]   compliance journey will be a fraction of the cost of doing nothing and potentially getting
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.360]   sued or getting a demand letter.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.400]   Yeah, it's totally true.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:42.480]   And I think you think a lawyer who is trying to be almost like a predatory major, trying
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:50.000]   to target companies of which to extort money using this type of lawsuit, even having that
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.080]   certification in itself is like, it's kind of not worth the time.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.840]   Just even having that proof is almost enough to probably deter most of the cases.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.360]   Because again, they're trying to hit by mass.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.960]   I think you hear a lot of situations where they're sending out 20, 50 of these notifications
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.160]   at once to companies and then see which ones bite, right?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.360]   So again, you're trying to minimize your risk and exposure to doing this.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.840]   How often do you think a company should do an audit?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.120]   Is it like a six months, a year or two years?
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.920]   What's your thoughts on that?
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.960]   Good question.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.280]   So the answer will be variable based on something that's out of my control, which is how
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.300]   fluid is this website?
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.840]   If it's a marketing brochure style website that's not going to change much for four or
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.200]   five years, I'll have a much different answer than if you have an ecommerce website or even
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.600]   just a more complex brand site that's changing and evolving and new features and micro engagements
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.460]   and calls to action and sales funnels and all that kind of stuff.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.440]   So if you have a fairly static website that doesn't change over time, my personal recommendation
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.520]   is you should go all in on this one time, dial everything in and then, you know, moving
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.160]   forward, do very small types of maintenance because the only things that may change are
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   like a blog post.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.840]   And so, you know, there's a very short checklist of what you could do to maintain a clean blog
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.200]   for websites that are more fluid and complex and nuanced.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.860]   At a minimum, we need to be doing something substantial once a year.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.100]   That's really my sound advice is once a year you need to be doing something.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.000]   We offer a service that's actually a twice a year service where twice a year we come
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.320]   to the table, go through a re-auditing effort and a re-verification of compliance.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.240]   And I would say twice a year is a good sweet spot for the typical business where this website
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.760]   is changing a lot.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:49.120]   We've had rare cases where clients ask for quarterly deliverables of conformance.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.740]   That gets quite busy for all parties.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.840]   Like you're basically never ending.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.420]   You're always doing remediation and that can be difficult unless you have like a big compliance
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.420]   team.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.400]   So once a year as a minimum, twice a year is even better.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   Awesome.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.000]   So I'm going to shift gears here a little bit and just kind of talk about just working
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.840]   in this industry and field altogether, right?
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.100]   Because I think I'm going to use myself as an example.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:16.400]   Let's say I find myself unemployed and I want to maybe consider transitioning job into this
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.600]   field because you've totally sold me on why it's so important, right?
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.320]   I might just off the bat say, you know what?
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.100]   I do not have a background in WCJ compliance, nor do I know all the details that go into
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.100]   that.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.300]   I feel like not knowing that puts me at a disadvantage and that might prevent me from
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.280]   applying altogether.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.720]   But I'm hoping the truth is that that's definitely important, but there's other things that you
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.760]   look for in an individual, whether it's skills or aptitude or even personality or drive or
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.260]   whatever, whatever that aspect is, that's important.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.500]   And I'm also assuming that the entry points, whether it's an entry position or whatever,
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.440]   it could be maybe it's diverse, right?
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.900]   So can you help us understand maybe the skills or knowledge that you believe is required
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.540]   to enter into this field and maybe even share a little bit about your journey?
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.480]   Like how did you get started?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.040]   Was it linear or did you kind of go like this in your career and land here?
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.640]   Awesome questions.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.840]   So let's first talk about the industry in general.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.620]   The good news is, if you're considering this career path, digital accessibility compliance,
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:26.220]   first of all, this industry is growing exponentially year over year, and it's been doing that for
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   about five years.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.740]   It's a very exciting industry to be in in the US because we are just hitting public
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.020]   awareness of digital accessibility as a need.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.060]   So there's so much opportunity and so few vendors right now.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.620]   We really have a supply and demand problem, a lot more demand for the work than there
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.500]   is supply of vendors, that's the first of all.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.720]   Firstly, the WCAG is not rocket science.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.500]   Anyone can learn these principles and become an expert in the field.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.280]   There are two, I'll just give a quick plug.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.400]   I'm not paid for these endorsements, but I'll plug them in.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.360]   We have two primary trade organizations, the IAAP and the W3C.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.760]   So the IAAP is the International Association of Accessibility Professionals, the W3C are
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.220]   the folks who actually author and maintain the WCAG guidelines.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.440]   Both of them have memberships where you can join as an individual, very low cost, and
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.580]   then take really awesome continuing education courses.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.300]   They provide independent certifications like career certificates.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.660]   So for a very small amount of money resources, plus some of your time, you can really become
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.700]   an expert quickly in this field, so I recommend that.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.980]   Then for the industry in general, in a company like ours, I think there's like four primary
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.120]   job roles, and these are universal.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.000]   So one of them of course is sales.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.640]   This type of business, or excuse me, this type of industry is B2B sales.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.480]   This is like high competency sales.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.760]   We're not just selling somebody, convince them and move on.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:32:00.920]   We're talking about complex compliance, B2B, a lot of legal liability in terms of the services
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.220]   that are being provided.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.920]   So if you are a good relationship builder, if you can build bridges and trust and rapport
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.700]   and then make the ask, that's the sales part, this is a really exciting career.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.840]   Secondly is project management.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:21.980]   So the PM career path fits in our industry because we have all kinds of clients and accounts
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.580]   that need to be managed and PMs, whether junior, primary, senior, executive, PM, you have a
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.980]   place in this industry.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.260]   Thirdly and most importantly are the workhorses, the auditors.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:40.520]   So to be an auditor, you need to be incredibly detailed.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.100]   You need to be a detail oriented, analytically thinking person because your job is to be
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.000]   looking at websites and code all day long.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.440]   And for some people that is like a dream, in others it's a nightmare.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.680]   So that's very important.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.560]   You do not need to be a web developer by trade to be a good auditor, although I will say
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.580]   if you have a background in code, it does give you a headstart and this will come more
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.680]   naturally to you.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:10.920]   But we have staff auditors who are web developers and also staff auditors who were not web developers,
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.340]   they're all equally competent, but that's something to consider.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.400]   And then the fourth and final category is like technical support, customer support.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.380]   This is also very classic, it applies to any industry, but companies like ours are always
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.480]   looking for technical or customer support people, providing empathetic, highly communicative
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.600]   support.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.920]   It's pretty standard recipe.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.160]   So those are career paths.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.340]   Then our journey is very interesting.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.040]   The very abbreviated version of our journey is that we were not an accessibility consultant
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.540]   on day one.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.620]   We were a web dev firm in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.420]   We designed and built websites.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.120]   I mean, we were a dime a dozen, nothing special about what we did.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.960]   In 2010, we won a government contract to build a website here for a local municipality.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.540]   One of the requirements, it was like the last afterthought bullet point on the RFP was like
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.780]   must comply with accessibility.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.900]   We thought, how hard could that be?
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.360]   And we won the bid and it turns out we won the job because we underbid dramatically because
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.620]   we had no idea what accessibility was.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.420]   And now we're contractually obligated to deliver something we know nothing about.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.880]   So we tried to hire a consultant.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:25.420]   We looked across the whole US, this is 13 years ago, there were only like two accessibility
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.220]   vendors at that point.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.080]   And you know, neither of them would even talk to us for like anything less than like a $20,000
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.240]   container, you know, and that was like just for the coffee.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.460]   And we realized, oh, this, like this work is not rocket science, it's not $600 an hour
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.460]   hard.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.340]   But that's what the industry was charging, supply and demand.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.400]   I mean, God bless him, there's only two companies you charge whatever you want, and enough people
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.180]   will be willing to pay the freight.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.180]   So that's what they did.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:54.720]   And to my business partners credit to our CEOs credit, you know, he said, you know,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.580]   there's nothing special about what we do with web design and web development.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:01.840]   I mean, there's 50 companies that do that just in our city alone that we're operating
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.000]   in.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.600]   But nobody's doing accessibility compliance.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.900]   And he made a bet that this would be the third evolution of web dev after SSL encryption
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.400]   and mobile response with this, he said accessibility compliance has got to be the next wave that
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.400]   hits the beaches.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.580]   And to his credit, he was right.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.780]   And so we got in at the right time.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:29.700]   In 2014-15, we really transitioned out of agency life completely and into accessibility
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.000]   consulting.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.380]   And we were just very blessed that it was like the right time with the right offering,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:40.500]   you know, from our agency world, we knew how to bring in business, we knew how to close
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.760]   business, we knew how to retain business with great customer service, we were just changing
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.600]   our discipline to a new thing.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.380]   But we're really glad we made that leap because we're one of maybe just 10 vendors today that
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.380]   do this.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.380]   So it's still a very small industry.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.900]   Zach, I just wanted to thank you for today.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:02.060]   The information you gave was so helpful because, again, I truly, truly, to the core of me believe
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:07.480]   that accessibility is one of those things where people just do not know what they don't
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   know.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.740]   And it's hard to say I'm coming out of this meeting having been the same as before, right?
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.740]   Like now I know.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.280]   And so I thank you for this really actionable insight.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.100]   I really like your breakdown into the four types of careers, one you can expect if they
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.820]   were to step into accessibility.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.940]   Thank you so much.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.220]   How can people find you or your website?
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.220]   >> Oh, great question.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.300]   So we are at onlineada.com.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.560]   Online A like Adam, B like David, A like Adam.com.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.140]   You can find us there.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.520]   And then if I could give one more thought, because I know some of the people maybe listening
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.700]   may be thinking about finding a career in our industry.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:50.940]   And so something we hate doing is going through the interview process, reviewing 500 resumes.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.220]   That is not fun for anyone on our team.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.820]   And I just want to put this out there as advice I wish I had when I was like in my early 20s
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.240]   and coming up in my career is if you want something, go out and get it.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.340]   So many people just go through the motions like I'll do my cover letter, I'll send in
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.300]   my resume, I'll see what happens.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.180]   If you want to work with us, reach out to us.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.360]   Find my CEO's email address, phone number.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.580]   Find where he gets coffee.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.300]   Go grab him, talk to him, say, this is my name, this is the value I bring and I want
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.300]   to work with you.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.660]   Like that really makes a difference because we want people who want to be with us.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.140]   So I promise it is worth it.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.460]   And I know that it's kind of going out of comfort zone sometimes it's like being vulnerable
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.460]   and putting yourself out there.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.840]   But it's a first world problem.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.300]   The worst thing that's going to happen is they're going to say, sorry, no, not for us.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   Who cares?
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.980]   Just put yourself out there and it will pay off in all aspects of life, especially in
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.740]   trying to find a job.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.740]   >> Totally agree, man.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.000]   As a matter of fact, embracing your vulnerability in a way that allows you to bring your true
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.860]   self out applies to everything.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.340]   And I think for those of us who can comfortably get there or work with someone to help bring
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.340]   that out, I think that's a key to success.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.580]   So it's a good call to that.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.580]   >> Thank you, Tim.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   >> Cool.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.580]   Thanks a lot.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.580]   >> All right.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.580]   Talk soon.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.580]   >> Talk to you soon.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:02.580]   >> Bye.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.580]   [END]
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:14.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
