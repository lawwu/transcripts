[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.040]   and strategies that have been helpful to him as he and his family have dramatically transformed
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.040]   their financial lives.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.960]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.960]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.560]   This is the show where each and every day I try to work hard to bring you some ideas
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   and some strategies that will be helpful to you.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.440]   Some content that will make a difference on your earning, on your spending, on your planning,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.240]   on your strategy, that will help you clarify your path to financial independence and then
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.240]   crush that thing.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.360]   That's what we're about here.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.400]   And today we're going to do all of those things.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.360]   I'm going to deliver to you on some ideas, some inspiration and some strategy with my
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   guest.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.560]   My guest Casey Lewis is a really awesome guy.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.760]   He runs a financial blog, has some financial coaching work that he does.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.840]   And one of the coolest things is just simply his breadth of knowledge and information.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.520]   He's involved in real estate and just a very diverse guy.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.320]   When I was researching different potential guests to invite on the show prior to attending
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.300]   the Podcast Movement Conference, which is where this interview was recorded, Casey stood
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.440]   out to me as somebody that I definitely wanted to have on the show.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.260]   And I think you're really going to enjoy this interview.
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.400]   We talk about a lot of different things.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.360]   Specifically some conversation I think is probably the most interesting to me was about
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.200]   goal setting.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.080]   And I'm going to be doing a lot more on goal setting in the future.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.280]   But as a little teaser, here's the interview with Casey.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.680]   Casey, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.680]   Hey, George.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.320]   Glad to be here.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.120]   So I've invited you on today.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.320]   I wanted to talk with you about some of your perspectives and some of the things that you've
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.960]   learned with regard to money.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.320]   One of the things that I love to do with Radical Personal Finance is not always talk to everyone
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   who is an expert, but also talk to people who've come from just a normal walk of life
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.480]   and hear their stories.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.400]   So I'd love for you to share with me a little bit about your story.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   Yeah, sure thing.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   So I got involved in personal finance and helping people with money by accident because
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.320]   I was an idiot.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.280]   And I went to college at Dallas Baptist University, didn't have any idea what I wanted to do.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.320]   And made a bunch of really bad financial decisions as far as student loans and taking the student
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.000]   loan refund check and buying golf clubs with them instead of...
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.640]   That's a perfect use for student loan checks.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.120]   Like that was when I first got my Mac computer and all of that stuff.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.720]   So went through that, got married right outside of college, had a really good job.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.920]   My wife had a really good job.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.640]   We had a fantastic income.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.600]   We worked really, really hard, spent a whole bunch of money that we didn't have, bought
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.360]   a house that we couldn't afford, bought cars that we couldn't afford, financed everything
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   that we could.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.120]   And as long as we were able to have our really, really good income, we could afford those
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.040]   minimum payments and everything was fine.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.280]   Never missed a payment.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.360]   All that was good.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.520]   And then all of a sudden, we both lost our jobs within 30 days of each other and life
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.040]   kind of sucked.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.600]   The stock market crashed and the real estate market tanked and both of our businesses were
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.480]   very tied to those industries.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.520]   This was 2008.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.240]   And you were one of the ones where both family members lost you.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.400]   I lost my job.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   I was laid off.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.160]   My company laid off about 3,000 people.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.440]   And 30 days later, my wife was in real estate working for a real estate company and they
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.360]   laid her off 30 days later.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.840]   What was that day like when she came home and said, "That's it"?
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.520]   I was just, "Okay, cool."
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.200]   And I had an idea.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   I'd been involved in the real estate market but wasn't full force.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   And I was like, "You know what?
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440]   Job market's tough.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   I'm just going to start up in real estate at the worst possible time to start up in
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   real estate."
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.400]   As an agent?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   Yeah, as an agent.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.960]   We crashed and we fought off it.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.920]   We did everything we could to avoid bankruptcy and foreclosure and repossession and everything
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.160]   we could.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.600]   We sold everything that we owned.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.280]   So all the cars, all the furniture, our house went down.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.200]   We had nothing in the house.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.160]   A small baby at home.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.800]   I would work in real estate full time during the day and at night I would deliver pizzas.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.640]   And when I wasn't delivering pizzas, I would work as a janitor cleaning toilets at our
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.880]   church.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.360]   And when I didn't have anything going there, I would put ads on Craigslist to fix fences
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.440]   or do manual labor or install light fixtures.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.040]   My wife got a job at Steinmart working.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040]   And we hustled.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.520]   And we got rid of the debts that we had.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   We didn't file bankruptcy.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.040]   We didn't have to go through foreclosure.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.080]   You short sale the house?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.400]   We still own our house to this day.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   So you were a little boy then.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   And our income during that time was probably even better after we got through that stuff.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   Our income was better.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.040]   It was just we were so sick and didn't want to be anywhere near bankruptcy, foreclosure,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.720]   anything bad to do with money again, that we paid off everything.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.800]   And it was a two and a half, almost three year of hustle.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   Let's get rid of everything.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.520]   And then we just avoided ever going back that way.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.960]   And in the process, people were like, "Hey, you are driving a 15 year old car now.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.760]   Why are you doing that?"
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.440]   And so I got to start sharing our story of like, look, we got out of debt and here's
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   the things we did.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.200]   And all of that led into me helping other people with money.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.440]   And I realized we're not the only ones that went through that stuff.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.080]   Everybody that I met, 75% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.000]   Everybody is one paycheck away from being right where we were.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.200]   And so it's my passion now to help those people realize what type of life you can live when
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   you're not strapped of monthly payments, when you're not strapped to having a car payment
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.640]   or student loans, or the idea that if you really hate your job and you've got 20 grand
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.360]   sitting in the bank, you just say, "Hey, boss, have a nice day."
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.280]   And you just walk out and you go get a new job.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.240]   Or if you have this passion and something that you want to go do, which we're here at
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.640]   Podcast Movement, everybody's talking about these things that they want to go do.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.880]   When you can free up your cash flow and you get your expenses down to a certain point,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.400]   you don't have to make as much money.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.680]   You can take some risks.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.920]   You can go chase some passions.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.620]   You can go chase some dreams.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.400]   You could take some time off of work and go be with your family and do fun things when
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.200]   you can figure out how to get rid of that debt.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.720]   Did you figure it out on your own?
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   Did you have resources?
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.000]   Was that like a Dave Ramsey thing?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.080]   Did you start listening to him?
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   No.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.680]   I mean, I'd heard of Dave Ramsey.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.080]   I'd done those things.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:35.800]   But it was hard knocks like, "We've got to figure something out."
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.720]   It goes for pretty much anybody out there.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.320]   The fastest way out of debt is to boost your income.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.920]   The fastest way to get financially free is to find ways to make more money.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.060]   Because at some point, your grocery bill can be slashed to nothing and you're eating ramen
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.600]   every night and your grocery bill is what your grocery bill is.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.280]   You've sold the cars, your electricity, your shit.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.600]   At some point, you're going to reach the minimum that you can do there and you may still not
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.040]   be able to make the traction.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.400]   But if we can take you from making $30,000 to $60,000 or from $50,000 to $100,000, this
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.120]   situation changes really, really quickly.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.960]   That's what I realized when we were going through it is that I've got to go from, at
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.400]   this point, I was making nothing because I was unemployed, to I need to go make a lot
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.320]   of money really fast and what are ways I can go do that?
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   Work more hours.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   That's always the solution.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.160]   It was a lot of hustle.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.360]   How much debt did you pay off?
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.680]   Any idea on how long it would take?
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.760]   Total student loans, credit cards, car payment, all of that stuff was about $250,000.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.520]   That deserves a high five.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.880]   So now what do you do?
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.440]   So now my full-time job is to help people realize the same stuff we did.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.760]   I help people get out of debt.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.160]   I walk them through their unique situations and go through that.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.480]   My focus and passion is helping people and providing tools and resources for them to
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   be able to make more money, to go from making $30,000 to $40,000 to $60,000 and really boost
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   their income.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.680]   I feel like if we can get people making more money than what they currently make, and this
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.360]   goes for the single mom that's struggling to get by making $25,000, if we can show her
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   ways and equip her to go, "You know what?
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.560]   I'm worth more than $25,000."
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.040]   Once she can get to that point, she can start paying off those debts, get out of debt, build
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.160]   a firm foundation for herself, and then go start doing really cool things.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.920]   Those really cool things could be whatever you want to do.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.120]   I'm not going to define what awesome is for you.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.960]   Awesome for me is like, I want to build water wells in Africa.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.800]   I want to use the money that I'm able to do to fund other ministries and projects and
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.640]   things that I want to go do.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.680]   I also want to travel.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.200]   I want to go do fun things with my wife and my kids.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.320]   Awesome for you, maybe you want to start that business.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.940]   Awesome for you, maybe that you want to go buy a G6 jet and fly around the world whenever
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.320]   you want to.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.480]   I don't care what awesome is for you, but awesome is not living paycheck to paycheck
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.800]   and worrying about the debts and the bill collectors and all of that stuff.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   Are you doing this with face-to-face coaching, with blogging, with podcasting?
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.920]   Yeah, so I've had a blog since 2008.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.680]   Good for you.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.920]   Kind of chronicled our journey out of all this stuff and then realized like, "Hey, there's
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.920]   people reading this and how can I help and give equipment and tools?"
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.920]   I have a blog.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.480]   I have a podcast.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.760]   It's the Casey Lewis podcast.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.840]   Because I have a big ego and not very creative.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.720]   And then, yeah, so I do some one-on-one coaching.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.800]   I'm still a licensed real estate agent.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.000]   And so if you need help anywhere in the country trying to find a real estate agent to help
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.600]   buy or sell a house, or if the agent you have is struggling to get your house sold, I have
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.640]   somebody in your area that can help.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.360]   And so people through my blog or through the podcast will reach out to me and say, "Hey,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.960]   I need a real estate agent and I'll help them find somebody."
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.000]   Are you at the point where you're able to live off of your online income and your coaching
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.960]   business or is it still being built?
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   Absolutely.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.360]   I have no other jobs, nothing.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.120]   I am full-time on...
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.700]   I help people get out of debt and find ways to boost their income and then help them with
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.700]   real estate stuff.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.320]   Of course, if you've been doing it since 2008, you obviously got rich overnight.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.080]   I launched out full-time doing this in December of 2014, so six months ago.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.360]   Well, that's exciting.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.760]   So let's talk about some practical tools and strategies for people who are looking to increase
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   their income.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.600]   Let's talk about the single mom.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.960]   I love that example.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.320]   I'm a single mom and I'm making $25,000 a year and I'm busy.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.120]   I got to be home with the kids at night.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.320]   I'm working a job that doesn't have a huge income potential.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   Where do I start?
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.920]   Well, a great place to start is with your boss.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.480]   Are you a good employee?
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   Are you working hard?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.300]   Are you a valuable asset to that company?
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.060]   If you are, go ask your boss for a raise.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.000]   That's a great first step.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   Just say, "Hey, I'm making $25,000.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.960]   Other people that do similar work to me are making $30,000.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.240]   I've been here for two years.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   I've been here for four years.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.500]   I'm a good employee.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.840]   I would like to make more money."
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.000]   And just see what your boss says.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.920]   What's wrong with just asking for a raise?
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.240]   We sometimes get stuck in the annual review mindset where I'm going to get my 3% raise
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.080]   once a year or whatever.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.280]   Just go ask them for more money.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   See if they'll pay you more money.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.240]   Now, don't do this if you've been at your job for 60 days.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.320]   Don't do this if you stink as an employee.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.880]   What you say, I agree with it, but it drives fear into my heart of thinking, "Okay, well,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   wait a second.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.240]   The first place I would start is not go ask for a raise.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.440]   The first place I would start is make sure that you've done a good job of being a startup
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   employee."
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.880]   So, start with, "I need to be a good employee that's worthy of a raise."
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.920]   Second, go ask your boss for a raise.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.320]   And if that doesn't work, maybe you need to apply for some other jobs.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.160]   And if you're going to apply for other jobs that are paying $30,000, $5,000 more, why
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.360]   not go ahead and apply for some jobs that pay $50,000?
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.600]   Maybe you're just charismatic enough to convince somebody and trick somebody to pay you more
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   money.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.800]   What's wrong with just throwing some applications out there for a $50,000 a year job if you're
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.320]   making $20,000?
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   There's nothing wrong with doing that.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.800]   And then the last thing, or another way that we can do this is realize that you are one
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.960]   person that has multiple talents and multiple passions and multiple things.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.360]   I'm a writer, but just because I'm a writer doesn't mean that I have to just write.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.120]   So I make money doing all kinds of other things that have nothing to do with writing.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.080]   You could have a full-time job and maybe you could start up an Etsy store or maybe you
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.960]   could start up...
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.520]   My wife is a teacher who also develops curriculum and sells that on a website called Teachers
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   Pay Teachers.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   That's awesome.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.160]   So you're not limited to one income source.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.400]   And I think sometimes we're like, "Oh, I'm busy and I've got all these things going on."
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   My wife is a teacher.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:19.320]   She prepares lesson plans for her job and then just sells those on Teachers Pay Teachers.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.360]   It's not anything extra.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   It's no extra work.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.520]   It's just an extra resource for her.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.400]   But once we can start getting out of the mindset of, "I have a job and this is where my income
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.960]   comes from and it pays me what it pays me and that's all I'm going to earn," when you
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.420]   can realize you have other resources.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:41.480]   We live in a time and an age where we are not limited to the income that one job produces.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.800]   And so in the Lewis household, we have 17 different ways we make money.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.520]   And some of those are $20 a month.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.440]   That's fine.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.200]   It's $20 a month.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.240]   Over a year, that's $250 I can take my wife to a nice dinner.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.900]   What's the littlest one?
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.440]   What's the smallest of those 17?
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   So I've got a deal.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.800]   I was with a real estate agency that has a profit sharing system when you refer an agent
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.320]   in and you get paid off of the profit for that.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.560]   And so that's the smallest one.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.480]   It pays about $20, $25 a month.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.720]   And what's cool is I've had buddies of mine.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.600]   I mean, another example, I've had buddies of mine who were real estate agents say to
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.320]   me, "Joshua, you've got to get a real estate agent just so you can get the referral commission
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.560]   when you refer a buyer or a seller to another agent."
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.320]   That's how I started and that's about 50% of our income.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.640]   My business revenues is from real estate referrals nationwide.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.160]   Somebody finds I write a blog article or something like 10 reasons why you need to sell your
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:44.000]   house or whatever because clickbait and drive people to the website.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.800]   They read that and at the bottom of the website I say, "Hey, if you need help in your area,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   click here."
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   They fill out a form.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.680]   I call them, talk to them, find out what they're looking for, what they need, and then I reach
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.360]   out to another agent in their area and refer them and I get paid a commission off of that.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.320]   And anybody with a license could do that.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.120]   Anybody with a real estate license is able to do that.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   That's awesome.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.720]   What is the weirdest, most unusual of the 17 streams of income?
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.360]   Most unusual.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.700]   I've been fortunate in my business to use different tools like Leadpages or different
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.640]   tools that have affiliate commissions.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:25.760]   It's just been surprising to me how easy some of those ways to make money are.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.400]   Easy because you spend hundreds of hours writing articles and then there's the easy $3.67 at
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   the end of it.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.760]   But Leadpages is a great example of one because there are other business owners that want
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.600]   to know how to build their business and what to do.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.360]   I just happen to have some tools and I did a quick 30-minute webinar screen share of,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.120]   "Hey, here's the tools I use and here's how you could do it for free, but I use this tool
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.840]   because it makes my life easier, but I do have to pay for it.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.200]   And then here's my affiliate link if you want to buy."
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:02.040]   So for that 30-minute webinar, one sale is $120 commission.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.200]   One sale, 30 minutes of work.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.440]   It was fairly a simple process to do it.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.400]   That's what's cool about online business.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:15.560]   If you've done the work of being underpaid in the beginning of building something that's
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.200]   a value such that people notice it and value your opinion, then over time there are many
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:27.400]   ways that you can earn revenue in a way that helps your readers and community and also
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.520]   helps you and helps the companies that you work with.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.120]   Yeah, from an online business standpoint, 98% of what I do is free.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.320]   I have 2% of things that I charge for.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.400]   And so if you need help budgeting, you can go to my website and you can get budgeting
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   forms.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.760]   If you need help figuring out how to get out of debt, you're going to figure out how to
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.760]   get out of debt.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.080]   If you need tips and tools and resources on how to boost your income, I've got 20 podcast
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.000]   episodes dedicated to boosting your income.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.600]   There's everything that I do is free.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.960]   And then if there's something that you need help with, you just call me up and we work
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   something out.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.600]   So let's go back, continue on the income.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.400]   If you've got 20 podcasts, you've got more ideas around increasing income.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   What else?
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.640]   So a great example is find multiple revenue streams.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.680]   Find multiple things that you can do to earn income.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.280]   So I've been doing online business stuff for years, but I've had a full-time job along
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.720]   with that.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.600]   So boosting your income really comes down to finding multiple ways to do it.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.680]   Because at some point, you're going to hit a ceiling.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.120]   The CEO of a company that's making $350 or $500 or a million, they've hit a ceiling.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.320]   There's nothing more they can do.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.880]   But we live in an age and a time where you can create something of value for somebody
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.960]   else that somebody else wants to do.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.360]   And I love the idea that it's like a sixth grader can help a third grader with math.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.080]   You don't have to be an expert.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.640]   I don't have to have a math degree to help a third grader with math.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.160]   I just have to be further along than you.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.560]   And so a great example here that we've learned this weekend at Podcast Movement is if you
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.960]   have a podcast, we know how to set those up.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.640]   So create a quick little class and show people how to set up podcasts.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.400]   There's people that don't know how to do it that would gladly pay you money to learn what
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.800]   you already know how to do.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   Right.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.080]   And the two variables that are benefits of that is number one, information out there
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.320]   is free.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.280]   Every little bit of information that you need about how to set up a podcast is available
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.680]   free on the internet with no charge associated with it.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.400]   But personalized advice and service is not.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.440]   And people value personalized advice and service.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.080]   If you want to get all the knowledge of the world, it's sitting down in your local library
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.680]   and it's sitting on the internet connection that you can go to get at the local library.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.520]   But if you want specific applied knowledge to your situation, that's a really valuable
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   thing.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.880]   So just because somebody else has created a class already on it doesn't mean...
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.560]   And a lot of people think, "Oh, well, I'm not qualified to do that," or "I can't do that."
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.560]   Yes, you can.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.160]   You have that knowledge to do something that nobody else does.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.040]   I have read over 200 books on personal finance, so I know more than you do about personal
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   finance.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   Not you personally.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.680]   I'm sorry if I offend you.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.320]   But I know more than the average person is going to know about personal finance.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.560]   And so would you like to dig through and read all the books and go through the classes and
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.920]   go through the bankruptcy and the stuff that I had to face?
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.760]   Or would you just like to pay me a little bit of money to figure this out?
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.000]   And so when people start to realize what you know and what you have is valuable and there
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.560]   are people out there that would gladly pay some money to shortcut that or to get to where
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.760]   you are faster, then yeah, that's what online business is all about.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.880]   And that's what has value.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.760]   So the book example is a good example.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   Takes time to read 200 books.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.240]   A lot easier to pay somebody $200 than to read 200 books.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   Exactly.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   That's it.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   It's worth it.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   And if you aren't worth $200, go read 200 books and you'll be worth $200 to other people.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.020]   Takes time to create lesson plans.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.800]   So it's a lot easier for someone to pay.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.240]   How much does your wife charge for lesson plans?
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.680]   Anywhere from $5 to $50.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.560]   A lot easier to pay $5 to $50 and save yourself hours and hours of work if someone else has
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.880]   done it.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.080]   Get that lesson plan, get out $5 and you're done.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.240]   And if you compare in many people's scenarios, I'm a teacher making $40,000 a year.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.580]   I pay $15 a week for my lessons plans.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.340]   That's going to have a negligible impact on my lifestyle in terms of the monetary component
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.720]   of my lifestyle.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.080]   But it might have a massive impact in saving me a huge amount of time.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   Exactly.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   And it's worth it.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.060]   And don't say like, again, we live in this time that's pretty stinking awesome.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.000]   Don't say, "Oh, I don't know how to do that."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.980]   Because like, "I don't know how to do that" is just an excuse for, "I haven't Googled
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.040]   it yet."
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.760]   Just go to Google, go to YouTube and figure out how to do some of this stuff.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.160]   We live in a time where you can make more money than what your boss is paying you.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:08.400]   And a great place to start, be a good employee, go ask your boss for a raise, and then start
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.040]   finding other ways to bring more money into your house.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.000]   I promise you, if you're making $30,000 by the end of this year, you could be making
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   $50,000.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.880]   It just takes some tips and some hard work to do it.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   It takes focus.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.720]   And you have to listen to 20 podcast episodes about how to make more money.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.400]   And likely, none of the ideas that are in the 20 hours of content are appropriate to
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.820]   your situation.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:41.400]   But the creative contrast, the creative connections between those ideas will get your brain starting
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.200]   to look around you and say, "Ah, in my area, here's something that I can do."
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   You could figure something out for your situation.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.440]   And one of the things, when I talk to people, is that they don't have an income goal for
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   the year because they're like, "What's an income goal?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.400]   This is what my boss pays me.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   Why would I..."
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.800]   I set an income goal for the year.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.280]   And so I challenged people at the beginning of 2015 to double what they made in 2014.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   They're like, "How?"
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   That's your job.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280]   I don't know how.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   I don't know how.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.800]   And so many people have reached out to me over the last six months like, "Holy cow,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.520]   I'm making $30,000 more this year.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.680]   My debt's going away all because I just said, 'Well, I made $50,000 last year.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.600]   What if I made $100,000?'"
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.320]   And then they track it and everything else you would do with a goal.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.200]   You'd write it down, you'd track it, you'd follow it, you'd see where you're at and try
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.440]   to make course corrections.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.800]   But just the sheer idea of writing down, "I'm going to make $100,000 this year if you make
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.920]   $50,000 or if you make $30,000, let's say $60,000, or we're in July, or we're in August
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.840]   now, so there's four months left in the year.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:54.440]   What if you can in the next four months make an extra 30% over what you've done the rest
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.080]   of the year?"
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.120]   Just a little bit changes your situation drastically, especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.580]   have debt, don't have a savings account.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.760]   Just a little bit, $200, $300 a month, and that is really easy to come up with in this
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   world.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:17.320]   And the cool thing about just thinking about a little bit instead of a lot is that it's
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.400]   easier...
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.280]   Earning a little bit of money as a side income is a lot easier and a lot more doable than
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.160]   replacing your full-time income in the first few months.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.320]   Earning an extra $1,000 a month because you're delivering pizzas, that's really useful if
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.400]   it's on top of $5,000 other dollars that you're already earning.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.120]   But if you're trying to earn the total amount that you need to support your family on delivering
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.320]   pizzas, that's a lot more challenging.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.440]   And so adding up these little things, there can be little businesses where every now and
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.560]   then someone calls you and asks you for help on this.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   Sure, I do it.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.760]   It's $100 an hour, and you go and you only do that six hours a month on one Saturday
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.920]   whenever somebody calls you.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.800]   There's no reason why you have to have just one thing that you're known for, one business.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.120]   There's no reason why you can't have 17.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.880]   That's why I was able to transition from a full-time job where I was making really good
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:18.960]   money to a career where I'm a self-employed entrepreneur going out and hustling and getting
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.720]   stuff done.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:28.000]   If I had to depend on just the salary from my coaching, for example, I coach two new
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.480]   clients a month.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.540]   I'm never going to make enough money to feed my family off of two clients a month.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:38.120]   But if I have two clients a month in coaching and I help somebody buy a house or sell a
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.380]   house and I'm in Texas, so in Michigan, we start adding all these things up and revenues
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.380]   get to where they need to be to where it's really easy for me to say, "You know what?
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.380]   Full-time job?
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.940]   I'm going to go ahead and let you guys go away, and I'm going to go focus on those 40
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.140]   hours for what else I can build and do."
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.340]   It's got to feel good.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.940]   Doesn't it feel great to be in the position of a teacher and see people taking action
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.940]   on...
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.860]   It's so great.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.300]   I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.140]   This has been a hard journey.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.980]   I think everybody has a hustle season in their life.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:16.060]   Even in your 20s, if you hustle early on with money in your career and you get your income
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.380]   up and you start saving, you get the benefit of 40 years of compound interest on your investments
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.860]   and you retire.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.860]   People that do their hustle season in their 30s and their 40s, well, they're doing it
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.620]   because they are trying to clean up some messes that they made in their 20s from overspending.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.380]   If you don't hustle in your 30s and 40s, you realize in your 40s and 50s, the kids are
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.700]   getting ready for college, I'm coming up on retirement, I should probably hustle, clean
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.020]   up some messes, get ready to retire.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.820]   And then in your 50s and 60s, it's like, "Oh no, I've got to hustle."
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.180]   But if you don't hustle any of those times, you're going to be hustling in your 60s and
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:52.060]   your 70s, working a lot harder and a lot longer hours when your body should really just be
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.980]   relaxing on a beach.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:02.060]   My hustle season, I'm coming up on the end of this five to eight year journey of working
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:08.380]   all the time, living on next to nothing, putting as much money in savings as we can.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.460]   And I've got two small kids, I want to hang out with them too.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.940]   That's a hustle season and get through it because I promise you, I promise you, I promise
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.620]   you it's worth it when you get to year eight and year nine and year 10 after you start
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.380]   getting rid of the debts and you've got a good healthy savings account, you can afford
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.100]   to make less money, you can afford to take some time off work, you can afford to spend
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.100]   time with your family and kids.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:35.740]   It's so much more rewarding once you've gone through this hustle season to be able to be
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:41.140]   on the other side and say, "I don't have to work for somebody else just because I need
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.820]   the paycheck to pay the bills."
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.540]   Do you set goals?
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.540]   Absolutely.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.540]   I figured.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.900]   I was just giving you an out.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.180]   You just gave a sermon on you got to set goals.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.820]   How did you learn to set goals and when did you start?
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.260]   So I learned setting goals when I was in car sales.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.900]   That was the first job I had right out of college.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:05.300]   I had a great mentor in it that just said, "Hey, your bonus level started when you sell
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.780]   12 cars and when you sell 15, you get another big bonus."
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:13.380]   So we broke down like, "Okay, I'm going to sell 15 cars a month because that's where
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.340]   the big bonus money is."
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.940]   And so for every 10 people I talk to, I sell one car.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.380]   So let's do that math to find out how many people I need to talk to in order to sell
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.380]   15.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.940]   Well, for every 10 people I talk to, one buys.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.220]   So I need to talk to 150 people this month.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.420]   There's 22 working days in the month.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.420]   Divide that out.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.300]   I need to talk to 2.3 people a day and I'm going to sell 15 cars.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.180]   How do I talk to 2.3 people a day?
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.380]   Well, I have to make these many phone calls to make that happen.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.540]   That's how I broke down, like really getting really nitty gritty with the details to a
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:56.860]   daily level of, "Oh, I just need to make 15 phone calls a day that will generate 4 appointments
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.260]   coming in the door for me to talk to this many people about buying a car.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.140]   And if I do this every day for the whole month, at the end of the month, I will have sold
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.620]   15 cars."
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.580]   And so when we started getting out of debt, it was the exact same translation of, "Oh,
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.980]   we've got $250,000 of debt.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.260]   Here's how much money we have available to do it.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.780]   It's going to take us X amount of months and just do the math, set the goal and follow
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.780]   the daily disciplines of making it happen."
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.980]   What percentage of your coworkers in the car business set goals that way?
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.580]   Half.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   Not to the detail.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.820]   I was number one when we were doing it.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.400]   I would imagine most salespeople are told to do it and then never actually break it
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.580]   down and do it.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.380]   And then what's worse is you set the goal and then you don't do any of the action steps
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380]   that you said you were going to do.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.380]   Right.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.820]   It's just funny because it's so simple.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.580]   In the financial services business, it was exactly the same.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:59.180]   I knew that if I was introduced to 1,000 people, I would call and I called 1,000 people.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.380]   500 of them would meet with me on an initial basis.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.540]   Of the 500 that would meet with me, 300 would give me all the details of their lives and
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.940]   share with me their goals, what they were working for.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.100]   Of the 300 that would do that, 60 of them would start working with me, would buy a product
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.420]   from me, or would engage in some further work with me in the first year, the first 12 months
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.660]   after first meeting me.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.300]   30 of them would engage with me in the second 12 months, 12 to 24 months of meeting with
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   me.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   And then 10 of them would engage with me in months 24 through 36.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:36.820]   And after months 36, nobody that was still in the initial 1,000, they would have found
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.820]   someone else.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.820]   They would have moved.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.260]   I don't like you, but I don't want to do big things.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.180]   If you know that number, let's just go find 1,000 people.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180]   Exactly.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.180]   So you break it down.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180]   And what do we have to do daily to go find those 1,000 people?
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.180]   You break it down.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.180]   You make 40 phone calls a day.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.560]   Of the 40 phone calls a day, you set five appointments a day.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.620]   You set five appointments a day.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.620]   You go into the week, you have 25 appointments.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.380]   25 appointments, 15 you'll keep, 10 will cancel on you.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.700]   You keep 15 appointments.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   Next week you follow up.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.380]   You schedule again the appointments on the day.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.260]   You know, you just track the numbers.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.220]   And so the way that you set an income goal, okay, I want to make $100,000 a year.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.180]   What's my average commission per sale?
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.180]   What's the average?
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   And then you do that.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.180]   And then you start to control what you can do.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.700]   And the only things that you can control what you do is your actions and your activities.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.060]   And so you take each part of your business and you say, all right, well, I can control
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.460]   the number of phone calls that I can make.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.380]   I can't control who says yes or who says no.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.980]   I can't control if they say yes or if they say no, but I can control the number of phone
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.220]   calls that I make.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.040]   Number two, I can control the questions that I ask.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.460]   So if I recognize that my average commission per sale is $52 because I'm working with people
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.700]   that make $20,000 a year, I can ask to meet people that make $120,000 a year.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.620]   And then just due to the fact that they need much more help, everything goes up.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.860]   And I think that's one of the things I, it's cool that you learned the same lesson from
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.500]   car sales.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.420]   That was one of the things that I wanted to learn when I went into financial services.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   I wanted to learn how to do that.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.940]   And it's so useful when you do that because then you always look at the world the same
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.900]   way and you take any goal and you break it down to a list of action steps and you say,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.380]   what are the activities that I need to do to accomplish this?
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.940]   And for your listeners, if you're struggling to get out of debt, the first logical step
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.820]   is let's write it down.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.820]   How much debt do I have?
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.160]   Like a lot of people, you've probably buried your head in the sand and just have a stack
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.860]   of bills sitting at the house and you're like, I know I owe people money, but I don't know
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.500]   how much and where.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.060]   When you actually write down who you owe money to, how much you owe money to, you get all
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.060]   that stuff down.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.500]   The next logical step is, okay, so how do I get rid of this stuff?
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.820]   And you set a goal and you start working toward it.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.900]   Writing it down is a huge first step that you can take to really accomplishing, if I
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.620]   want to boost my income, if I want to reduce my debts, what is it?
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.620]   Just write it down.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:52.780]   The other aspect of income, if we can apply the same thing to income even without the
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:58.740]   numbers regarding car sales or financial product sales, you can apply it to income in the way
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.580]   of just simply per hour.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:07.180]   So if you want to make $200,000 a year, that means that your hourly rate needs to be $100
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.180]   an hour.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:18.980]   So $100 an hour is $200,000 a year over the course of a 40-hour, 50-week per year working
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.980]   schedule.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.500]   And a little trick there is, you put me on the spot, all of a sudden I'm questioning
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   my math.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.620]   I didn't put you on the spot, you jumped into this one.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:32.500]   So if you just take the hourly rate and you double it and then you add some zeros, you'll
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.500]   get the annual income.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.220]   So somebody is making $8 an hour, you take the 8, you double that to 16 and then you
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.640]   add some zeros, you wind up with $16,000 an hour.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.880]   So you can convert any hour, $10 an hour is $20,000 a year, $20 an hour is $40,000 a year,
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.340]   so $100 an hour is $200,000 per year.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.480]   But if you look at the $100 per hour, that means that every single hour that you work,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:02.220]   you have to create more than $100 worth of value for your employer or for yourself.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.420]   If it's for your employer, you have to create more because your employer has other costs
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.780]   and expenses that are associated with you.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.020]   They're paying your employment taxes, they're paying insurance, they're giving you an office.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.460]   So you might have to create $170 worth of value per hour.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.420]   If you're an entrepreneur, you can figure it out yourself.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.420]   How much more do you pay?
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.980]   What are your taxes, etc.?
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:29.060]   So you have to look at every single hour of work and say, "Am I producing $200 worth of
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.560]   value so that I can earn $100 per hour in the last work?"
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.740]   The answer is if you're not doing it, you're not going to earn $200,000 a year.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:43.160]   That's why you're not earning $200,000 a year is you're not producing for every hour of
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.620]   work in excess of $100 a value per hour.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.840]   But breaking the goals down, the reason I went into that is very few people do that.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.520]   A lot of people set goals and say, "I want to make $200,000 a year."
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.960]   I kind of sit around and wish and hope and think, "Well, I can make $200,000 a year."
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.840]   And I've been guilty of this myself, of saying, "Well, something's going to happen."
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.020]   Well, something might happen, but you should also look and say, "I'm going to work 40 hours
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.020]   a week.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.720]   If I'm going to earn $200,000 a year, every hour that I work, I need to be doing work
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.280]   that's valued more than $100 an hour."
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   Exactly.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   Well done, sir.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.520]   This is your podcast interview and I just stole it.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.960]   No, that was great.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.920]   I think this is why I love the world that we live in because we all have a little different
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:30.280]   angle and we need all of our input because different people's brains work differently
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   and different examples work and it helps.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   People can find the person who speaks their language who's able to convert a complex topic
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.680]   into something simpler and more straightforward.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.040]   Get outside of the hourly mindset of it and just say, "If I've got a product for sale
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.240]   for $200 and I want that product to make me $200,000, well, how many of this product do
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.320]   I have to sell in this time period?"
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   You get that taken care of.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.480]   That's from an entrepreneurship world.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   I did this exercise a couple of months ago.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.800]   I sat down and I said, "I would like Radical Personal Finance to make a million dollars
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.640]   gross income per year."
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.200]   Okay, a million dollars gross income, where can that come from?
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:17.480]   So I designed 10 individual income streams, each of which can produce $100,000 of income.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.200]   Then I broke the $100,000 of income down and I said, "Okay, let's say I write a book.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.720]   How many books would I need to sell at what rate in order to reach $100,000?
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.520]   If I'm going to create a product, a training product, how many products would I need to
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.440]   create at a certain course level to do it?"
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.560]   What's helpful is I look at a million dollar goal and I get completely overwhelmed.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.120]   I say, "How on earth can I build a business that makes a million bucks gross in a year?"
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.120]   I've never made a million bucks gross in a year.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.080]   But if I break it down and I say, "Well, let me think about this," and I break it down
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:57.120]   to a certain number, now I know I need to sell 2,432 books or I know I need to sell
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   452 tickets to a three-day seminar.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.560]   Then I can take each of those things down and I can say, "How can I develop the plan
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.280]   behind it in order to make sure there's value?"
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:13.520]   So if I'm going to charge $452 for a three-day seminar ticket, how can I develop a seminar
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:21.640]   ticket that's worth, my goal is 10x return, that's worth $4,500 in value to a participant
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.160]   so that they'll be willing to happily pay me $450?
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   You can break it down.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.120]   When you break it down, over time you create your action list, you create your daily list,
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.080]   you break the goal down, you start working on it.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.800]   Create one line of business, get that going, create another, and then improve, tweak, improve,
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.160]   tweak, and that's how you get from zero to a million dollars per year.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.440]   - That was the key, one at a time.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.560]   If you're listening to this, you're like, "Holy cow, he just said 10 things with 100."
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   Pick one.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   - Right, right, right.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   - Pick one.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.000]   If it's a course, do the course.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.680]   If it's a book, do the book.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.320]   If it's you need to go ask your boss for a raise, go ask your boss for a raise.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.600]   One at a time, slowly and steadily, set the goal, write it down, come up with some plans,
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:08.920]   and just go take some action on one thing at a time, and then over time, one thing at
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.640]   a time leads to you did 10 things, which leads to those 10 things getting $100,000 a piece,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.040]   which gets you to the million dollars.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.680]   - I wish your wife were here.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.720]   I'm interested in her business.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.880]   Talk to me, hopefully you know enough about it that you can share a little bit.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.120]   How did she come up with that idea?
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.080]   - The website exists, and it's called Teachers Pay Teachers.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.920]   It's like an Etsy store for teachers, or just an online little classroom thing for teachers.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.700]   - But I mean, did she ... She was a teacher, and were you guys just sitting down and brainstorming
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.200]   ideas for businesses?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.840]   - No, this is just something she did.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.120]   - Somebody else created the website, and then she just submits lesson plans.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   - Yeah, it's like Etsy store.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.880]   All she did with this is she created it, and was like, "I have this.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.040]   I've heard of Teachers Pay Teachers.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.800]   Let me upload this and see what it did."
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.280]   In the first month, we made $80.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.880]   We were like, "Well, that was weird."
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   She was like, "Okay."
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.520]   We checked, and they have a premium plan where you can pay them ... I don't know how much
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.080]   it is for the year, but you pay them, and their commission rate goes way down.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.760]   I think it's like a 70/30 split with you, but if you pay them money up front, it's like
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.760]   a 90/10 split on the commission that you get.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.760]   - That's awesome.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.000]   - We paid that, and yeah, I mean, it's an extra several hundred dollars a month.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.080]   When teachers complain that they don't have enough money to buy supplies for their classrooms
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:32.200]   and stuff, my wife is like, "I have $200, $300 a month coming in that I can go buy supplies
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   for my classroom."
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.320]   It's things that she's able to take care of that way.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   - That is so cool.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:44.040]   - Yeah, it was a great thing that just simple, easy, and if she wanted to, which she doesn't
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.160]   want to, she doesn't have to, she could upload a whole lot more stuff and do a little bit
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.400]   more work inside of that, and really create a business.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.320]   There's teachers that have stopped teaching because they're making more money just creating
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.960]   content and selling it on Teachers Pay Teachers.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:05.760]   - Reminds me of that guy who, he worked for a big company in some kind of software engineering
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:11.200]   job, and he was being paid $40 an hour, and he outsourced all of his work to China, or
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   to India, and paid a guy there $15 an hour to do all of his work.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   He just collected the difference.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.520]   He did it for years before he got caught.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.520]   He was immediately fired when he got caught, but he had outsourced his job for the last
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.920]   three years, and he just kept the spread.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.360]   He kept the float between the 40 and the 15, and put it into his pocket.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.560]   - This is not an endorsement to do that.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.600]   - No, but it's just funny because you think, "Okay, I'm going to go get a teacher job,
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.520]   and the government school system, okay, I got the job.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.840]   I just got to do the bare minimum.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.000]   I don't feel like making lesson plans or doing them.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.120]   I'll just go buy them.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.560]   I'll pay someone else $15.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:52.520]   There's enough money sloshing around that I can take enough to live on while someone
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.200]   else does a lot of my work."
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   Of course, I still have to actually teach in that scenario, so the programmer's job
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.440]   was better.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.560]   What tools, do you have any specific tools that you really have found to be beneficial
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.040]   for you in managing the process of your finances?
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.880]   - This is a question that comes up every time, like, "What software do you use?"
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.280]   Everybody wants to know what's the secret.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.960]   There is no secret software that makes your money better.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.000]   There's nothing.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.920]   It's a pen and paper, and knowing where every dollar is going.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.200]   That is what makes your money better.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.800]   When you sit down and you write it down, and to this day, I don't use a software.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.200]   I don't have a budgeting tool.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.240]   There's a ton out there.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.040]   I sit down with a pen and paper.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.080]   I say, "This is how much money I'm going to make this month.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.380]   These are my bills.
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.620]   This is what I want to save.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.240]   This is how much I want to give to our church.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.920]   This is how much I want to give to these ministries," and make all that balance out.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.680]   Then I just go execute that game plan every month.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.120]   Some months it's hard.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.280]   Some months, like we're at a conference this month that three weeks ago I wasn't planning
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.600]   on coming to, so I had to adjust the budget to make that stuff happen.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.000]   We always, it never fails, get to the 25th of the month, and we've used all the money
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.760]   we said we were going to use for groceries.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.560]   We've got six days left in the month, and we eat out of the pantry because it's the
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:22.200]   last six days of the month, and we don't have any money left for groceries.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.060]   When we do that type of stuff, my investment accounts get filled.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.440]   My savings accounts get filled.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.040]   I get to give the money to my church that I want to give.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   My kids' college funds get taken care of, and all of that stuff is done.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.240]   Whereas, if I'm not paying attention to that, it's, "Oh, we need groceries.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   Go to the grocery store.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.320]   Spend the $200 for this last week of the month."
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:49.360]   Okay, sure, no big deal, but over time, that's $2,400 a year over a five-year period.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.240]   That's $10,000 a year, and you can see how people over a two and a three and a five-year
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.440]   period wake up with $10,000 of credit card debt.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.520]   No, it's the principles are timeless and can be applied consistently.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.880]   You say you've read over 200 books on personal finance.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.960]   What's your favorite?
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.440]   Which one do you recommend more than any other, more frequently than any other?
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   Besides my own.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.840]   Tell me about your book in a second.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.280]   I didn't know you had a book.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.000]   I have a book, and it walks people through personal finance, everything from budgeting
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.440]   to everything else.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.000]   But Dave Ramsey's is a fantastic book.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.480]   Total Money Makeover is a fantastic way to start.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.840]   Then he has another one that I really, really recommend.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.740]   It's called More Than Enough.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.580]   If you haven't read that, it is about how you have more than enough money right now
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:44.740]   where you're at, and it really, really focuses on the contentment aspect of you don't need
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:45.740]   that new car.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.100]   You don't need that bigger house.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.620]   You don't need that nicer furniture.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.620]   You want it.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.140]   You may want it really, really bad, but what do you want more?
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.780]   The book's called More Than Enough.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.900]   What else?
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.780]   Those are probably the two best to just get started and really get moving forward.
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:08.420]   Rich Dad, Poor Dad's a great one for small businesses getting into the mindset of transitioning
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:15.940]   from the "I'm an employee" to "I'm a self-employed person" to really moving over to the right
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:21.140]   side if you've read the book into "I'm a business owner and now I'm an investor."
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.580]   When you can start making those switches in your mindset of how you earn money, you really
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.860]   start getting to earn a lot more money.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:28.860]   Awesome.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   Tell us about your book, your website, podcast.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   All right, cool.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   I have a book.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.500]   It's called Impact.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.100]   The whole idea behind it is the four phases of personal finance.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.740]   Phase one is education.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.300]   We all have an education in money.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.580]   It's how it was taught to us when we were kids and our parents didn't do anything.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.100]   We're taught by the world that we need car payments and we need student loans and all
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.260]   that stuff.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:51.420]   I really tear down those walls of the old way or the way the world teaches us about
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.060]   finance and just teach you what we've been talking about.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.480]   Then the second step of that is to take action.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.140]   Really start doing things that are better with money, making better decisions, and that
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.460]   you're not going to be perfect with it.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.980]   The third phase is that you're going to have time to get mastery in this stuff.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.860]   Then the last phase is being awesome.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:16.300]   Like I said earlier, I don't know what awesome is for you, but if you go through and you
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.720]   learn the right ways to handle money, you take action on it, you get better over time
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.220]   at doing that stuff, eventually you get to be awesome.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.180]   Awesome for you may be that you're writing people's electricity bills for them because
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.420]   they can't afford to pay their electric bill or like I said, maybe it's that you want to
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.220]   buy a G6 and fly around the world.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:38.060]   I don't know what awesome is for you, but eventually over time, enough discipline, you'll
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.060]   get more awesome.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   That's the book.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.060]   It's called Impact.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   It's available on Amazon.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.020]   I think it's like five bucks.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.020]   That is my book.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.300]   You can find me on Twitter @CaseynLewis.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.900]   The N stands for Ninja.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.380]   My website is Casey-Lewis.com.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:58.140]   Casey, thanks for coming on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.140]   Thanks man.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.140]   It was fun.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.420]   Sound so simple when you hear other people talk about it, right?
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.420]   Guess what?
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   It is simple.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.420]   Not easy.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.740]   Not at all easy, but it is simple.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.420]   Especially the approach to goal setting, laying things out, making a plan.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.700]   In the future, and we'll see depending on I'm pre-recording this, probably leaving for
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.980]   FinCon and XYPN.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.620]   So we'll see if I'm able to get it done before or after this.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.100]   But I've got a little sneak peek for those of you who made it to the end of this interview.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:33.260]   I've got a little goal planning software that I want you to check out.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.740]   It's at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/goals.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.260]   The software is called Goals On Track.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.180]   I'm going to do an entire episode to introduce it to you, but it's something that I went
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:44.060]   out and searched for some number of months ago and I've really found it to be useful.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.980]   It's basically a lot of what I've talked about, but it's put into a computer software system
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:48.980]   that can be helpful.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:53.460]   So if you want a sneak peek on that, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/goals and look
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   forward.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.740]   That is an affiliate link, so it'll make me a little bit of money if you buy.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.900]   But that is something that I went out and searched for because I was dissatisfied with
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.660]   a lot of the other software solutions that I found.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.500]   So entire episode coming about that.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   But lay out some goals for yourself.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.500]   Work on some plans.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.440]   And then get busy on the action steps that will make them happen.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.500]   Check out some of Casey's work, links in the show notes for today's episode.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.740]   Hopefully many of you can find some of his content to be helpful.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:26.940]   That's what I love about profiling other financial bloggers, financial podcasters, other people
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:33.980]   who have different voices is they can bring an air and a different style that will appeal
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.980]   to different people.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.460]   We all resonate more with different styles.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.500]   And so make sure to go out and check out some of Casey's work and hopefully many of you
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:48.300]   will find him to be an expert coach and advisor to you.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.300]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.980]   Thank you especially to the patrons of the show.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.180]   If you gain benefit from today's show or any of these shows, would you consider supporting
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.180]   the show directly?
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.780]   This is a voluntary deal.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.900]   I work hard to give away a bunch of value.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:04.300]   And then if any of this value is helpful and useful to you, I would appreciate it if you
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.060]   would send a little money my way.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.420]   And the way you do that is go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.260]   Thank you to the over 220 of you who do that.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:17.020]   We're working hard to get by the end of September to in excess of 250.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.980]   So if you want to see how we're doing on that, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.980]   you can see the numbers.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.040]   Since this was pre-recorded, I don't know the number, but you can.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:41.560]   See you all soon.
