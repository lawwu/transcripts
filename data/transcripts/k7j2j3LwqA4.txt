[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Hi, my name is Angie. I am a wife and a mother of four here in Dallas, Texas. I've been a
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.060]   ministry partner with Desiring God for a year and a half. You are listening to the Ask Pastor
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.800]   John podcast with Jon Piper.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.220]   We're going to talk more with Angie in a moment, but first up, today's episode. Today's question
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.660]   comes to us from an anonymous young woman. Pastor John, I thoroughly enjoy listening
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.920]   to these podcasts and find them exceptionally helpful for dealing with life's challenges.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.200]   My challenge is anxiety at work. I work in medicine. For some time, from school until
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.260]   now early in my career, I think I suffer from imposter syndrome, a phenomenon that commonly
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.260]   affects professionals, often females, with tendencies to be perfectionists, leading them
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.160]   to think they're a fraud at their job, not good enough, and any success is theirs by
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.280]   chance.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.680]   I don't trust my own talents and skills. Because of this, I experience significant
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.920]   anxiety before and during work to the extent that I feel like I need to quit. This is really
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.960]   affecting my mental health, not because I don't enjoy my job. I do. I pray to overcome
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.160]   this, asking for help and for healing. Do you have any thoughts? Also, I recently came
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.440]   across a coach who specializes in imposter syndrome, and she overcame it herself. Would
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.760]   it be wrong for me to seek help from a non-Christian coach?
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   I'm going to save that last part of the question for another time, because the more I thought
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.320]   about what she's dealing with, that's what I feel like I need to address here. We can
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.240]   take up the issue of the proper or not proper use of secular counseling later. So here's
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.440]   the four traits that I see in her life that need a biblical perspective. Perfectionistic
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.320]   tendencies, a sense that really when she's competent at work, she's a fraud, she's an
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:12.760]   imposter. Third, her successes and competencies really are just owing to luck. And fourth,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.480]   anxiety that comes from all of this. So let me give what I see as a biblical perspective
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.360]   on those four traits of her experience and hope that this biblical perspective on each
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.320]   of these will bring some measure of liberation from a life of illusion.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   I would call the imposter syndrome a kind of professional anorexia. In other words,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.040]   what anorexia is to the body, the imposter syndrome is to your competence. With anorexia,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   a 90-pound, 80-pound, 25-year-old woman, might be a man, but it's almost always women, stands
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.160]   in front of a mirror and sees an overweight woman. With the imposter syndrome, a competent,
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.400]   successful, responsible, helpful person stands in front of the mirror and sees an incompetent,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.360]   irresponsible, unhelpful, fraudulent employee. The challenge in both cases is to overcome
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.240]   the illusions and live in reality with Jesus Christ at the center.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:28.440]   So first, perfectionistic tendencies. Very often at the root of the felt need to always
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:38.320]   do better and to do more is the deep uncertainty of being loved and accepted and approved most
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.280]   deeply by God, but also by other significant people in our lives, like parents or friends
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.680]   or supervisors. Now, the biblical response to such drive toward doing more, doing better,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.040]   being perfect is not to discourage people from the pursuit of excellence, but to turn
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.000]   everything upside down. In other words, apart from Christ and his salvation and grace and
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.240]   friendship and forgiveness and acceptance, apart from Christ, we are constantly striving
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.600]   toward love, toward acceptance, toward forgiveness. The gospel turns that upside down and puts
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.320]   acceptance and love at the bottom, from which we can then strive for excellence without
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.400]   the burden of "I've got to prove myself in order to get myself loved." By grace
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.280]   alone, through faith alone, on the basis of the work of Christ alone, we stand on the
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.000]   glorious rock of the forgiveness of our sins, our acceptance with God, the removal of our
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.740]   guilt, the canceling of our debts, all of it rooted in the love of God who chose us
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.640]   for himself before the foundation of the world. That's where life and every day starts.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.400]   And then there is, of course, varying degrees of passion for achievement and excellence,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.800]   but we don't pursue it in order to get accepted or in order to get forgiven or in order to
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:26.140]   get love. So I would encourage and urge our friend to step back and make sure that she
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:37.420]   has a true and real and wonderful and restful and sweet grasp of the gospel of Jesus, what
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:45.380]   he did for her on the cross, what her salvation is by grace through faith. Oh, it's a very,
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   very liberating thing to realize I can still pursue excellence and yet not be strangled
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:02.200]   and anxious because of all the insecurity and fear that I can't do enough to be loved.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.940]   Life has been turned upside down. It's been turned on its head. I'm free. So that's the
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:15.340]   biblical perspective on perfectionism. Second, she refers to a sense that she may be a fraud,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.060]   a fraud at work rather than truly competent, truly responsible and helpful. Well, here's
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:31.420]   what fraud means. Fraud is an intention to deceive a person or a group, usually for personal
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:39.640]   gain, which puts the other person at significant risk. We don't call it fraud. When somebody
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:48.220]   thinks we have more competencies than we think we do, if we have no intention to deceive
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.700]   them and if there is no evidence that we lack competencies that they think we have. If you
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.980]   come into work every day with a goodwill, not a deceptive will, and at the end of the
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.740]   day you are perceived as competent, responsible and helpful because there's been no evidence
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.940]   to the contrary, you're not a fraud, no matter what your feelings are. Number three, she
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:20.820]   says that people with this imposter syndrome are prone to chalk up their competencies and
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.960]   responsibility and helpfulness to luck. Now, the most natural response to this is to call
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.820]   it irrational, which it is. You go to work every day, week after week, month after month,
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.100]   year after year, and always perform at a level of competence and responsibility that causes
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.740]   your supervisors to approve. And your mind says that those several thousand moments of
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:53.460]   competency were strokes of luck. You never had a bad hand in 3000 games of poker. That's
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.180]   irrational. But all destructive syndromes are irrational. So what good does it do to
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:06.740]   say that? She knows it's irrational. So here's an alternative to that response to this imposter
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.740]   syndrome and thinking, "Well, it's luck. It's luck." I would suggest that you embrace
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:19.340]   this, think hard and long about it, and preach it to yourself. There is no such thing as
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:26.860]   luck, period. There is no such thing as luck. What the world calls luck is God's providence.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.820]   So what you're dealing with is not several thousand professional instances of luck in
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.140]   which you lucked out and proved competent and responsible and helpful by accident. That's
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.940]   not what's happening. There's no such thing as an accident or luck. God, not luck, brought
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.460]   about those thousands of moments of competency and responsibility and helpfulness. This is
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:09:01.300]   a pattern of divine sustaining, divine support, divine help, divine guidance, which bears
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   all the marks of a calling, a vocation from God. Therefore, when you wake up in the morning
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:15.700]   and you feel anxiety that your luck might run out today, one of the answers is to preach
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:22.060]   to yourself, "There's no such thing as luck. Stop thinking that way. It doesn't exist.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.860]   God has sustained me in all these thousands of moments of competency that I've been calling
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:33.740]   luck. God has sustained me, even if I am truly incompetent." I mean, imagine it. "Even if
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:41.400]   I am truly incompetent, truly irresponsible, truly unhelpful, God has chosen for thousands
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.740]   of opportunities to cause me to act as if I were competent and were helpful and were
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:55.940]   responsible, and he intends for me to see in this pattern a calling, a purpose, a design,
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:04.140]   because he's faithful. It's not luck. It's God." So get up in the morning and say, "I
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.260]   will walk into this day not crossing my fingers that luck is going to run out or won't run
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:17.600]   out, but rejoicing, rejoicing in faith that my God is with me. He's faithful. He'll keep
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.300]   up his end of the calling." Which leads just to a brief statement about
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:29.880]   anxiety. You can see the answer to anxiety is already built into the other three. Jesus
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:38.300]   said, "Do not be anxious," and then he gave eight reasons in Matthew 6, 25 to 34 for why
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:46.740]   not to be anxious. All of those reasons are rooted in this. Not that you are really competent.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.240]   That's not where they're rooted. They're rooted in this. You are of more value than the birds,
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:59.480]   and you are of more value than the lilies, and God is sovereign, and God is faithful.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.200]   So good. Thank you, Pastor John. If you have an immediate question about Christians benefiting
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.880]   from non-Christian counselors and programs, we address that in episode 1435 of this podcast,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.580]   talking there about AA in particular, but with relevance for many other areas. Check
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.540]   out episode 1435 for more. Before we go, we're joined on the phone by
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.680]   my friend Angie, who lives in Dallas. You heard Angie's voice at the very beginning
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.300]   of this episode. Angie, thank you for your time. You're one of the precious saints who
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.060]   make this podcast possible, and it's an incredible honor for me to do this work, and I only get
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:40.120]   to do it because we have donors like you, Angie. So thank you for making this podcast
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.160]   possible. Talk to us for a minute. What does this podcast in particular represent to you
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.680]   as a listener? The Ask Pastor John podcast, I think for me,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.960]   has been an incredible daily opportunity to hear from Pastor John, literally, audibly,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.480]   daily, however often, with moments of gospel-centered encouragement. It's almost like a quick coffee
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:10.720]   with a dear friend that provides an opportunity to stir affections for Christ. And so in ten
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.520]   minutes, an opportunity to grow together and to grow in that affection for Christ.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.560]   As a mom and a wife in the place that I'm at, and knowing how people listen to these
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.160]   podcasts and just in their car, in their carpool line, and just even as they're cleaning dishes
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:31.280]   in my sake, I respect that people listen, especially during these crazy days right now
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:37.160]   on so many levels. I think it is just a constant encouragement to realize we have brothers
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.640]   and sisters who are helping to stir affections for Christ. So I just commend you guys on
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:49.000]   how steadfast and faithful and diligent you all are. I mean, every writer, every writer
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.720]   of articles, writer of books, we adore you all. We are mutually thankful for each and
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   every one of you.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.760]   That's super encouraging. Thank you, Angie. Tell us a little bit more about your story
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.120]   and how you eventually became a ministry partner with us.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:10.320]   Brad and I have been consumers, if you will, of Desiring God for about 20 years, meaning
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.480]   we first heard of Pastor John 20 years ago, the book Desiring God. All that we learned
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.560]   about Pastor John kind of led us to the ministry of Desiring God. And with that, we consumed
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.920]   and were spectators and learners and listeners for years and years and years. And then about
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.720]   a year and a half ago, it dawned on us that we could take a next level step of becoming
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.360]   partners and really joining in, kind of taking more of a family ownership, if you will, of
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.000]   our relationship with the ministry and with everybody on staff with Desiring God. And
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.920]   we really wanted that. Now that we had been partakers in so many ways for years, it felt
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.240]   like there was a missing step for us that just to complete that relationship and that
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.120]   partnership. And so it was a real natural desire of just wanting to jump in deeper in
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.240]   whatever capacity that we could. And at that moment, it was to partner financially. But
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.840]   what it became more of for us was partnering relationally to journey together in a deeper
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.520]   way with Desiring God.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.640]   Wow. We're so grateful to God for you and your husband. Thank you, Angie, for helping
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.280]   to make this podcast happen. And if you're listening right now and you want to join Angie
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.000]   and become a ministry partner so we can make more DG resources and spread them all around
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.440]   the world, you can join us right now. Go to DesiringGod.org/donate. That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.480]   As we near the end of the year, we especially appreciate it if you want to join us, especially
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.720]   those of you who have never joined before. I'm Tony Reinke. We will see you back here
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.960]   on Wednesday. Thanks for listening.
