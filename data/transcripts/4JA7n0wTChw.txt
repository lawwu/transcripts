[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.260]   sometimes you make some venture bets and they don't work and then you're like I just invested
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.360]   in the wrong trend and in fact sometimes you invest in the wrong company but it is the right
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.600]   trend and those bad investment cloud your judgment
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:33.800]   Bill we're back I think it's the 10th anniversary congratulations Philippe and Thomas thank you of
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.440]   course we're at Cotuzzi East meets West down here in Los Angeles I think it's an event that founders
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   I certainly know you and I look forward to every year as I said to you both it's hard to put together
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.120]   something that has this much durability this much impact you do this incredible overview on public
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.360]   markets on venture markets and technology that I think you know you publish today online that
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.200]   everybody should go out and download and take a look at and so you know we've been at this now for
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.820]   a couple decades having built something like this is really cool so I just wanted to say thank you and
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.660]   conversations on on on the 10th anniversary and you know Bill and I thought why don't we just go
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.600]   through you know you had this slide today we got to sit through and listen to you guys commentate
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.140]   about uh some of these slides we wanted to share it with everybody else so we're all so excited to make
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.080]   our our debut as a podcast duo the world premiere we've we've done them individually but not as or we
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.040]   we're announcing we're announcing our new pod we yeah exactly we got bg2 and now we got what is it lb2
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.800]   lafond brothers too you know let's let's go so we're uh we're squared squared but yeah by the way I would
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.540]   just add like I think the conference is is kind of a a really amazing gift to the industry and for the
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.980]   founders to get to come like it it harkens back to the like when I was really young in this industry the
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.120]   agenda conference everyone would stay for the whole thing and so your opportunity to network
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.640]   is so much higher and a lot of conferences today people fly in and fly out but you know here you
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.860]   you've got some amazing people that are around for the entire thing it's just incredible yeah yeah
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.880]   agreed well I mean let's dive in you have a big budget for smoothies you know your smoothie budget
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.160]   really keeps people intact and by the way for for people that are listening um this deck we're going to
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.560]   reference some of the slides the code 2 team put it on their website uh just a few hours ago and so if
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.020]   you want to download it and have that as as we go through this it might be helpful yeah you should I
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.860]   mean Philippe let's just start off I mean you and I it seems like we spend most of our time talking when
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.560]   things get bad in the world and yet this is probably the most optimistic that I've heard you on this stage
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.660]   in the 10 years that you've been doing this right we talked you talked us through this slide four which
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.400]   is the AI super cycle slide and and and this slide which I thought was incredible slide six which is
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.360]   when will AI reach 75 percent of total US market cap which I think is incredibly provocative how you
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.260]   compare that to industrials and transport because everybody's saying it's so big already it can't get any
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.640]   bigger so just kick us off you know contextualizing your level of optimism and this slide like can it
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:30.500]   really be 75 percent of total cap yeah uh so listen um every time I'm optimistic I'm worried this is it
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.560]   you know this is the peak uh and now that Thomas and I are doing this podcast together we're guaranteed
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.500]   to be doomed but I think that at the end of the day that's how everybody thinks first of all so it's
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.480]   never priced in yeah everybody's worried that it's all the time the peak and yeah yet despite that uh
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.120]   things tend to work out I think today we've learned from these founders and stuff like that
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.560]   that AI is probably the defining and biggest tech trend that we're going to see and I showed you the
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.020]   different waves there's only been a few waves over the last 70 years or so going back to main frames
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:16.900]   and one person made the point that the networking we needed the pcs the internet we needed network pcs
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.180]   sass we needed what happened before and AI is also built so one of the reasons these trends get bigger
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.580]   they're built on all the on top of each other exactly so I think that's one second part we've tried to do
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.900]   and bill you've been great at it and brad you've done too is let's always try to look back at the
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   past I find that this concept that like uh even though we're talking about new trends they've been
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.160]   new trends you know since the canals and uh yeah uh and uh whale oil and uh things like that right
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.040]   and so you look in the eight eighteen hundreds and stuff you know we start having a real finance and
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.200]   real estate industry then uh probably uh at some point especially after the second world war we had a
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.540]   real manufacturing uh industry and then we've had also a market dominated by energy and right now
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:19.180]   it's about 50 tech but um we had the ceo of uh the largest uh power plant uh sort of utility uh with us
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.500]   we had the ceo of the largest equipment maker for utilities today you're sort of wondering not just
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.860]   ai is going to become bigger tmt is going to become bigger but there's some sectors that should we
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.540]   reclassify them as tmt or utilities now like the next semi-cap what's the difference between a nuclear
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.180]   energy plant and a semi-cap guy they're both there at the beginning to help you create something that
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.480]   delivers a tech product yeah the you know said another way technology when when we got started
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.780]   thomas was five percent of global gdp today is 15 percent of global gdp and when we're sitting here in
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.860]   10 years i think you're saying confidently while there'll be a lot of noise and a lot of volatility
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.380]   it's going to be more than 15 percent of global gdp you guys talk about again like what the new class
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.400]   of ai entrance are so the mag 7 has actually underperformed this year but we have ai power we
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.600]   have ai related software we have ai semis that are up on the year you guys have diversified out
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.280]   philippe into some of these other categories you were just talking about it is that the case that
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.720]   everybody got crowded into mag 7 and now you see all of these other companies accelerating this year that
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.040]   that are starting to get some of the benefits and i think this one maybe thomas you should take it and
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.200]   also contrast it to what's going on a bit in the private side if we can add that too because there
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.240]   was a time where max 7 was a real excitement and now it's changed a bit yeah so it was interesting
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.840]   seeing that we think that on average the max 7 i mean it was basically flat year over year and yet
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.600]   tremendous value accretion to the top ai companies right whether it's open ai or anthropic that's right
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.140]   we're all kind of the following companies but to me my other takeaway looking at this and i was
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.560]   thinking about core weave that recently went public and you guys are big shareholders in we are and big
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.760]   fans of the management team and i think a lot of skepticism around that business and that business
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.480]   model but at the end of the day being an ai pure play there's very few in the public market right right
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.280]   and so you know i look at this list there's amazing companies on on this list but a lot of them
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.320]   might have legacy businesses or other kind of right i think of a google as an example right
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.940]   of certainly has a lot of good ai but also has some disruption threats so seeing new entrants like
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.500]   core weave that are a pure play on the trend yes um i think has been a really kind of positive
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.140]   development as well another thing today's an appropriate day to talk about this the stable
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.000]   coin legislation you know passed today which is a major you know we're going to want to talk about
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.540]   to sax about this later later but a major step forward for the for the you know kind of regulatory
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:07.340]   framework around u.s finance you were funny today uh philippe on stage talking about bitcoin you know it's
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.180]   this category that's broke you know you said it's broken out you lose sleep over it every single night
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.760]   because you're still not invested from an institutional perspective in it like a lot of us
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:24.920]   and yet you you showed this slide 18 where you said maybe the volatility of bitcoin is is coming down
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.420]   which might put it more into an institutional asset class talk to us a little bit about how you guys
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:36.840]   think about crypto maybe at the price you know we all have post-traumatic stress from the 1920 period
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.760]   i think of a venture investing in crypto is that changing is it now in the 2020 2020 i mean yeah
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:51.000]   i like that but i was like the first of the really early days of venture you know i do think it's
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.180]   actually really interesting to think of bitcoin as a company for the sake of our investing universe right
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.940]   we do think like the relative market caps becomes really interesting so as you see in in some vardec
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.160]   especially at the end first thing is awareness we need to include the large ones as we think about
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.820]   how they're valued versus kind of other things and so how do you think about how do you think about
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:20.000]   valuing it i mean listen uh but just touching back on your point so we we're looking at bitcoin it's like
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.540]   all right the market cap of the world the net worth of the world is like 450 500 trillion equities i think
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.720]   are like 120 or stuff real estate's probably another 100 150 then there's a value that people have in their
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:43.600]   homes uh gold is about 15 to 20 trillion uh above and under uh the ground and then we're like bitcoin
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.580]   at two and i'm like god so bitcoin it represents you know two out of 500 of the net worth of the world
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.560]   or 400 whatever it moves a little bit could it be four could it be five and then we're like well the
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.740]   largest company microsoft today is like three and a half trillion let's say that microsoft i don't know
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.800]   doubles in 10 years it would only be growing at seven percent per year microsoft will be a seven
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:14.200]   trillion dollar company in 10 years and could bitcoin be five or six it's a real asset class right and
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   then on top of that it's very volatile then on top of that there's a lot of retail people that
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.720]   uh own it and it almost feels like sometimes you know the institutional investor is wrong and the
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.820]   retail investment right sometimes it's the opposite retail gets caught in a little bit of a meme stock
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.700]   and it comes back down and i don't think we can afford to ignore it anymore so it doesn't mean like
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.880]   we don't really know exactly when and how to own it and then your other point that's really interesting is
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.600]   sometimes you make some venture bets and they don't work and then you're like i just invested in
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.800]   the wrong trend and in fact sometimes you invest in the wrong company but it is the right trend
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:04.580]   and those bad investment cloud your judgment and there's bitcoin there's stable coins which we should
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.920]   talk about they're growing incredibly right now and then there's all these out coins and you could say
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   okay well i don't like the out and the meme coins i don't like necessarily the collectible aspects of
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:21.700]   things but i like stable and bitcoin so for us it's more a process where we just need to become
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.500]   better be willing to change our mind and stay open to the future and those are a lot of the
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.460]   conversations that you have one thing i'm curious if you agree my one of my biggest lessons looking at
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:37.360]   private market investors versus public market investors is the appetite for institutions in the
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.440]   public market for assets that are perceived to have significant downside i.e. like 70 or 80 percent
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.700]   that are mark to market i have found is just really low yeah right investors on the public side just
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.780]   don't want to take that kind of risk right and so versus on the private side you are because you may
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.080]   have 20 of those they're not mark to market and you're like look maybe five go to zero but my other
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:05.380]   10 go so i do wonder how institutions versus retail may be willing to take that risk i wonder how
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:11.960]   institutions will think about an asset like that you know let me kind of telescope out for a second and i
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.920]   want to get bill's opinion on this as well like i think all of us you know now a couple decades into
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.740]   this i think one of the most powerful things about this conversation is mental flexibility
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:29.480]   yeah right and you know i think when you're when you're maybe a little bit younger in the business
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.560]   you're more dogmatic you develop an opinion you defend it to the hilt right and if you're wrong
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.140]   it can be extraordinarily costly and i think crypto was that way for a lot of people and you know they
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.760]   they carved out these positions they were like this is you know this is a fad and then they they're
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.000]   proven right at a moment in time because it'll have a 50 drawdown and so rather than re-evaluating
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.540]   their priors they lock in to that position bill how have you because i find venture particularly tribal
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:03.960]   yeah about this point you're locked in you can't sell so i think this is something that you guys
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.740]   develop more of an instinct for in the public markets right in the private because you're in
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:13.020]   you're in you're in forever like with the private companies you can learn lessons along the way but
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.680]   your windows are really long right whereas i think if you're in public stocks where you can
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.860]   you know change your mind and and make a decision right away that's very different yeah i mean you
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.640]   referenced drunkenmiller today you said you think this may be the most valuable attribute of the great
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:36.100]   investors i mean listen when he told me i've made 120 of my money on obvious ideas and i've lost 20
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:42.780]   elsewhere and then you start thinking of bitcoin and a company being like the fifth largest company in the
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.660]   world now it's a bit odd what i'm saying i recognize it because you could also say well should we consider
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:54.120]   gold as the largest company in the world because it's worth 20 trillion and not necessarily but i do
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.840]   think like forcing yourself to think differently and at least being at peace okay i thought differently
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:08.480]   i came to the same conclusion yeah and being able to do that now as to us being a flexible the fact that you
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.200]   think that french people are highly flexible people i'm very thankful of that i'm not sure it's true but
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:21.300]   we'll take it uh two things that are new about crypto that should should lead anyone to reevaluate
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.160]   the government's gone from being kind of antagonistic towards supportive that's a big shift because
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.800]   regulatory risk was a big question for all this stuff and then the stable coin you know based on what
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:41.060]   people are talking about this is a high utility use case for people that that is companies are using it
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:46.500]   you know as part of their workflow process that's a that's a new dimension as well so
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.400]   one additional thing just point on that that i think is interesting is
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.920]   you know when you talk about the u.s dollar you know the the the view is always well what's the
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.040]   alternative you know i'm not going to go do i want to go into europe you know probably not it's kind of
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.500]   interesting well what if actually the alternative is bitcoin right um and so that's something i've kind
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.920]   of been spending time on we you know we talked a lot today about the dollar and interest rates and
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   what's going to happen and sure um so it'll be interesting to see whether that becomes a legitimate
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.360]   alternative to you know the overspending of governments and when you have a stable coin right
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.840]   how long is it before a new regulation goes through that allows a stable coin to pay interest
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.020]   sort of odd stable coins can offer rewards but can't pay interest and when you have a stable coin
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:38.300]   with interest how long is it before the government creates a one-year stable coin a five-year 10-year
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:45.200]   30-year stable coin which will allow every single person around the world to invest in the usa so the
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.240]   government is going to have an incentive to not have these bonds be sold through these like weird
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.100]   dealers and this and that right the government should go direct to the consumer just like
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:02.340]   just like companies do so i bet you that in the not too distant future people will be able to
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:08.300]   automatically invest in bonds and so that's yet another example on top of what you were saying tom
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:14.560]   about the the bitcoin and stuff that i think it's uh anyway we need to switch topic otherwise i'm gonna
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.700]   really pull the few hairs that you and i have left okay back to back to ai one one of the topics you
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.880]   guys had an incredible audience here you had andy jassy here you know talking at lunch kevin weill from
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:31.260]   uh open ai and one of the topics was consumer ai and i thought one of the most incredible pieces of data
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:39.400]   that you guys shared was looking at the impact that chat gpt which is now scaling to you know kind of a
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:46.380]   billion users is having on on google and you did this by conjoining a couple pieces of data that you
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:53.240]   guys had so thomas you want to talk to us a little bit this is slides 22 and slides 24 uh and and and
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:00.260]   and slides 26 i'll i'll pass it to philip for this chart but okay i think bill and i were chatting about
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:06.420]   this earlier it anecdotally it certainly seems to be the case right uh the more people i talk to
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:12.600]   the more i ask them um do you feel like your google search has been impacted by chat gpt and and
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.820]   resoundingly i i almost everybody at this point now agrees that that's the case right and we can argue
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.580]   whether the queries are commercial or not i think the queries are getting more commercial yes every day
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:30.580]   but without a doubt it's having that impact we could not prove it numerically it felt intuitively true
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.680]   obviously google is telling you it isn't right so i think we went about seeing is there is there
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.720]   a numerical assumption that we can make that would kind of prove this out and i think you should
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:47.960]   introduce the work yeah and and by the way as we you know all these platforms have some businesses that
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:54.500]   get threatened and other businesses and google could still be an amazing company by just saying listen
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:01.360]   maybe search is on the threat but youtube is with all this new ai content gonna explode and
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:08.240]   potentially threaten netflix and maybe waymo is gonna also do incredibly well so our judgment more
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:16.020]   is around what exactly happens i mean the assets of the android phone and the gmail and and the google
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.080]   docs and like that's a nice set of complementary pieces they have so many great assets it'll be very
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.560]   interesting to see how it plays you know for me if i were ceo of google that would be way above my
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.080]   yeah basically i would have no idea how to put it all together but god is it just fun to be alive and
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.520]   just see how what's amazon gonna do what's google gonna do what all these guys so what we try to do
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.880]   here is as part of the data science that we do we process probably a hundred million credit card
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:50.640]   receipts a day so we have a very fine view of what the u.s consumer does and we have another data set
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.160]   where we know what consumers do based on their email receipts and the trick was to try to join
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.900]   those two data sets and in general in data science my only lessons learned is data is useless unless you
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:11.120]   can join data sets that don't speak to each other that is the unlock and so we did that and what you see on
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:22.320]   that uh chart is that absent chat gdp uh chat gpt maybe uh google page views for particular user growing
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:29.040]   four percent per year so we are consuming more google then we get a subscription to chat gdp which we uh
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   chat jesus christ i confused gdp and gpt we get a subscription and now we're like ah this guy's paying 20
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.240]   bucks a month yes and then we track once he started paying the 20 bucks a month
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:49.520]   to open ai what happens to the usage and you can see peak to trough it's down eight percent year
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:56.400]   over year peak to trough it's let's say down 11. so clearly page views are going down and that's over
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.480]   almost two years right so it's not like it's immediate it's not like it's an immediate gigantic
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.720]   threat but one thing we've learned and thomas and i repeat that to each other all the time is
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.720]   these major shifts they just start one little step at a time and that one little step becomes
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.640]   a gigantic move quickly so you can't underestimate these small moves and i i think this confirms
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.520]   something that we all know anecdotally as as we're talking about well and i think that you know even
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.920]   slide 24 you know when we were talking two years ago about chat gpt we knew it was off to a good start
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.560]   but the question was what's going to happen when meta you know gets its game going what's going to happen
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.240]   when google launches gemini what's going to happen when elon launches grok what's going to happen when
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.440]   you know claude gets better we all thought that when they got into the game that this line would
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.240]   start to flatten out but the fact of the matter is chat gpt has been radically more resilient and the
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.200]   engagement has increased much faster than i think any of us would have thought with that level of
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.280]   what's interesting about that is that's true in the us it's true internationally yes it's true
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.320]   whether you look at it on downloads it's true whether you look at it on engagement it has blips
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.400]   here and there the deep seek moment and others but the resiliency to me bill it does remind me a little
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.720]   bit of when uber got started right and it would just they established that market share and you know it was
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.760]   just incredibly difficult to disrupt right yeah for listeners that don't have the slides we're looking
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   at chat gpt adoption against twitter instagram facebook and tick tock and it's just you know
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:40.160]   you know straight up and way ahead way ahead of those against by the way those apps had inherent
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.440]   virality as you know i mean you're kind of the expert of that this doesn't right this has no virality to
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.720]   it it's just value to the consumer correct driving adoption although i would say that we're starting
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.800]   to see network effects right on the data side we're starting to see switching costs with permanent memory
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.720]   as you and i have talked you know starting to see what's amazing is you have this level of adoption
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.320]   even before those things begin to kick in but it confirms what we kind of know to be true we saw this
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:13.520]   with google right we saw this with facebook yeah and now we're seeing it again with chat gpt
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.720]   kevin who was on stage after you guys talked made an interesting comment which i mean it's it's
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.280]   tautological but it it still kind of resonated with me he said look this is products going to get better
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.720]   so you have all of this adoption with that's what's scary you know the product's getting
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.160]   yeah it's not even three years old we could show the or maybe we did show the stat about also the usage
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:45.360]   in terms of minutes yes right right that more maus more weekly users more daily users and then more
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.840]   time per day which is a lot which is also consistent with all of our personal lives right yeah um we're
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.880]   going to keep forging ahead here we're going to get crunched on time slide 27 bill is i know a slide you
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.320]   wanted to talk about when we talk about these new hyperscalers and what you did here is you were mapping up
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.720]   cloud revenue market share to the share of nvidia gpus so bill why don't you i'll just describe this so
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:15.200]   people and that are listening can follow along and then we'd ask you guys to talk about your takeaways
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:22.240]   from it but they they the co2 team mapped out cloud revenue market share and you have oracle five percent
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:30.960]   amazon 44 because of the success of aws google 19 and microsoft 30 and then you show right next to it the share of
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.640]   nvidia gpu allocation microsoft and google are about equivalent uh 30 and 20 to what they have in the
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.720]   in the cloud revenue market share amazon notably 44 of cloud revenue market share but only 20 of nvidia
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:55.600]   gpu allocation and then oracle jumps from 5 to 19 and core weave comes out of nowhere to be 11. so tell
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:03.040]   tell us why you guys put this together and what are your big takeaways i mean for me as a um i'll go ahead
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.920]   and then you go as a as an as an analyzer of companies this might be my favorite slide because
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.840]   it shows like the competitive dynamics at work and whose strategy will win out you know i mean i look at
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   this and and one obvious takeaway is that amazon has half the share of gpus than their shave aws so
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:30.000]   that could mean one of two things either aws is behind an ai that could be one or they're pursuing a
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.720]   different hardware strategy than it's uh than its competitor which andy spoke specifically about so that
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.280]   could be or a combination thereof right so that's one and number two it shows the reinvention of oracle
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.840]   mm right i'm incredible incredible left for dead in this left for dead in the 2000s left for dead in
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:56.080]   the sas era left for dead in the ai era now coming back and then also i give corey a tremendous amount
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.600]   of credit of just entering the market as a pure play had difficulty raising capitals none of us ever
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.680]   believe there's no ip you're just buying gpus and reselling them just by being in market and being focused
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.640]   right started to build that relationship with nvidia and now it's punching way above its weight
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:20.880]   so it's a by the way the third theory could just be that nvidia would prefer not to have a dominant
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.160]   customer like they wouldn't want this to be the customer though it hasn't seemed to impact
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:32.240]   microsoft and google so yes do you want to add anything yeah i mean listen i would say the one thing on
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:38.400]   that chart is damn hard to get the numbers right so there we have to explain the viewers like we could
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:45.200]   be off by you know five or six percent up or down but i think where we're not off is the concept that
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.600]   some players are getting more gpu chips than others and so then the question is are nvidia gpus
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:59.040]   a prediction of future cloud revenues and i think the answer is like and uh we haven't even included
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.520]   stargate which is going to start coming up here right and what if what if anthropic also becomes
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:11.600]   its own hyperscaler you could have a world with more like a dozen hyperscalers than like the two or
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.960]   three that we've had before the overseas the sovereign then you're going to have the sovereigns for sure
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.640]   you're going to have some telecom operators more traditional operators in europe is that so there'll
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:30.240]   be more right but i think what definitely is going on now is there's sort of a battle between uh people
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:40.320]   that want to standardize on nvidia pay the nvidia rent yeah and get the supply versus people who also think
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:47.200]   like hey i'm bringing a lot of software i already have a lot of the data and i can afford a different
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.840]   strategy in the internet era almost every startup started with oracle and sun and five years later
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.200]   they weren't on it so there is some precedent there is and i also think like uh the other one that
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.240]   surprised me i i even have a hard time believing that those are the numbers is i thought google was
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.920]   more skewed to tpus than nvidia so there's some people who are going exclusively with one chip there's
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:18.800]   some people who are going to go in a hybrid way google both as a nvidia and tpu i think amazon is
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:25.600]   also choosing a path of like hey we're still making a ginormous bet on nvidia but we also would like to
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:33.440]   have you know our own bet and i wouldn't be surprised if maybe someday an anthropic or uh maybe even an open
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:39.520]   ai would say uh maybe we should design our own chips and then frankly you might have uh some very
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:46.240]   expensive model with enormous reasoning that runs on nvidia and maybe a super cheap model just for some
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:52.640]   very local applications maybe that could run on a custom chip so i think a lot of it is going to morph and
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:59.360]   change uh over time but at least what's fun here is let's go revisit this chart in like five or seven
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.040]   years and be like okay different people play chess the different ways what's happening and i think to
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.400]   me the thing that stands out most about this slide again slide 27 microsoft you know you talked about
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.920]   the explosion in terms of token production you know we we might be a hundred million tokens a month
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:22.320]   already out of microsoft microsoft is open ai so you got chat trillion hundred trillion i know you knew
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.560]   that you know for the so it's a yeah so what's really driving inference and and this token explosion
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.960]   like consumers first and foremost and google's got gemini right microsoft derivatively is supporting
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.440]   chat gpt as is oracle and core weave on the slide amazon doesn't really have a big consumer application
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.880]   right so their need for those gpus uh may also be a little bit lower correct uh in this
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.280]   slide very good one of the i want to jump ahead a a few a few sections because i want to i want to
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   get to the private side the venture side of this but i want to end the public side with the the macro
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.560]   backdrop philippe you're one of the best you know we've been at this a long time we know that you know
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.920]   we invest in companies that are doing extraordinary well we look at fundamentals but you can't ignore the
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:15.520]   macros dan loeb says if you don't do macro macro does you um we found that out the hard way too
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:22.240]   many times in our career but if you obsess about it it can also uh be your undoing one of the things i
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.600]   thought was so interesting we're at this moment in time where we we've heard from elon and the guys on
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.040]   the all in pod david friedberg and others who are saying you know we're in this debt spiral there's no way
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:39.920]   out of the debt spiral you know and yet if you look at the tenure the tenure is still at three four three
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   four four right despite the calls that it was going to be at six five or seven we haven't got anywhere
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:51.840]   close we've been in a band between three five and basically four eight now for two years and you
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:58.240]   presented an argument on slide 45 about the productivity cycle that may come out of ai right
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.840]   that may drive faster growth in the economy much like we saw in the 90s with the internet
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.760]   that could in fact lead to lower inflation and lower rates on a permanent basis it's kind of this
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:16.880]   backdrop that would bring the deficit to gdp below you know uh four percent i know you guys work
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:24.160]   closely with with larry summers you know and others and so as you think how important is believing this to be
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:33.360]   true in our overall kind of public uh investing today so your original question philip should we be worried
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.120]   that we all think that ai is a big deal right the counter to that is to say okay well what if we're
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.800]   right on the ai but we're wrong on something else and we actually analyzed three things we analyzed are
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:51.600]   markets expensive and the answer is yes but they were markets were expensive the 90s during the pc and
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.800]   internet era and the market did well so that's number one number two we said well are tariffs a
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.400]   big deal and we said yes they're important and maybe they haven't gone through inflation yet but this
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:08.960]   doesn't feel to us like i like to say that the tokens trump tariffs yeah right basically and so we're
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.040]   basically left with this deficit first thing that's on deficit is having doge and having people like elon
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.640]   say that we're spending too much it's useful yes and we should repeat that every day it doesn't hurt
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:28.160]   but what i was wondering is since it's so obvious that it seems that we need more doge we need to spend
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.400]   less and stuff like that who are the people who every day are buying bonds 30-year bonds at four and a half
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:40.800]   percent and i'm sure you're uh the listeners know that but a one-year bond at four and a half percent
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.960]   stays and gives you four and a half percent a 30-year bond at four and a half percent on its way to six
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:50.640]   or seven you could lose 60 or 70 percent of your money yes you know once you have a 30-year multiplier
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.920]   on a change in interest from four and a half to six right and our basic instinct was to analyze what
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:04.480]   happened in the internet in the pc days where we had exceptional productivity gains when the internet and pc
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.280]   really took off in the 90s and to say hey what would happen yes if we had similar exceptional
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:18.160]   productivity gains and basically the answer we were trying to solve is in essence today we're at
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.480]   100 percent debt to gdp on our way to 140 and we said what would it take for actually debt to gdp
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.240]   to stay at 100 or maybe even bend the curve and go down to 80 and what's really surprising i think if
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:36.880]   you just show maybe the next slide or or so yeah uh i think if we move forward yeah just a little bit
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:43.840]   you'll see that if productivity for the next decade or so was about two and a half to three and a half
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:51.920]   percent per year right we could achieve substantial reductions in this key ratio of debt to gdp and i'm
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:58.400]   not saying we're there but i'm saying that at least we've been able to bookend what would productivity
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:06.080]   need to be to achieve an 80 100 instead of 140 debt to gdp this is slide 51 just for the people uh
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:12.480]   following along which is you know again an incredibly important point we know there are people buying
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.520]   bonds every day at four and a half percent so the question is why are they doing that and one of the
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.040]   answers may be exactly what you're saying what if they're right exactly what if they're right and we're
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:32.320]   wrong and in fact uh one funny part is in 1993 debt to gdp was supposed to go from 40 to uh or 60 to 80
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   by expert and it in fact went from 60 to 40 yes so experts can be wrong by a lot right and so i'm not
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.800]   uh good enough macro guy and if tech guys pretend to be good macro guys you know it's the beginning of the
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.240]   the end but at least we have a little bit of analytical thinking around what it would take
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.400]   and bill and thomas you guys are much better placed than me in terms of your discussions with all the
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.880]   privates which i think we're leading to now and all these amazing new products and you're telling me that
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.960]   that's not going to create like massive productivity i really think it is and and and drawing from that you
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:17.440]   would end up with with gdp growth more like the five percent plus maybe even six which by the way
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:23.680]   that was the case for many of the years in the 90s then sort of product uh you know uh and by the way
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:30.400]   the six would represent four and about real terms whereas in the past you know most recently we've
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:36.080]   more be at like you know two or three which is more like the one in terms of real terms so you know
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:42.800]   just to wrap up your flight path for the public markets i think it's fair to characterize as you
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.120]   know tariffs fairly much being under control multiples are you know pretty full but like they
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.840]   were in the 90s they can stay full that the backdrop is okay it's like the the bond market and rates are
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:02.320]   still in the fours and we have this ai super cycle with that on the public side would you characterize
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.480]   your exposures to the public market philippe as in the top third middle third or bottom third of your
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:14.080]   you know kind of average exposures you know brad i knew you would ask me that and you know i'm not
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.480]   going to answer that but nice try i tried nice try i try okay let's nice try let's shoot over let's shoot
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:29.360]   over to privates i think one of the things that was a consistent theme if you look at slide 60 and and 61
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:37.280]   is this idea that the private economy uh thomas right we've had three or four years of really uh
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.840]   nobody getting out of the chutes these companies have all stayed private um the percentage of of of
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:50.800]   unicorns as a percentage of the public markets has gone up but now we're starting to see an unlock here
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:58.720]   both in terms of mna and in terms of ipos so talk us through the big themes from the slide 60 and 61
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:06.480]   today about how you know ai has reignited this deployment and x and and exits are starting to rebound
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:12.240]   yeah i'm curious to get bill's view here because he probably thinks about this as much as i do and
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:18.480]   i'm curious whether he'll draw the same conclusion i i think by and large we all agree that the
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.000]   environment of 2021 was incredibly unhealthy both for companies and for lps too much capital going in
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.880]   not enough coming out a kind of a broken cycle if you will um you could see that's in so many measures
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.600]   amount of dollars going in no money coming out historically low ipos even worse than post-financial
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:44.720]   crisis which is kind of incredible to think about so on almost any metric you looked at we were kind
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.840]   of in the danger zone and i would say more or less that's been true over the past two or three years
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:57.120]   this is the first year and this is the crux of the the view i'm curious if you share where the
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:04.080]   signals are going from red to i would say yellow and potentially green we're seeing first of all a
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:11.680]   rebound in ipos we're seeing ipos perform better we showed uh basically the performance of the cohorts
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.760]   and how they've improved substantially since 2021 one of the data points that shocked me re-looking at
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:26.480]   this is that the 2021 cohort within one year of going ipo was down 40 percent and five years later is down
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:33.200]   50 percent i mean just pause on that for a second that was a shocking slide that here we are five years
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.560]   after those companies went public and basically the market has gone vertical but that's correct on the
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:45.120]   relative basis they're probably down 71 75 i know you're right slide 71 i think i i brand i didn't
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.760]   believe this so i actually i i went to look at every single company on this as by this does not include
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.680]   specs so that which is even more extraordinary this is just traditional ipos so um it's not dollar
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:04.240]   weighted no no it's correct yeah so um so there's a lot of scar tissue there yes right but i think we
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   have signs to see things improving so we just talked about the ipo market we've now seen some really
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:16.320]   strong ipos that have performed well core weave circle hey thomas remind me what does zerb say sorry
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:23.600]   to ask such a dumb question but what zero interest rate oh zero yeah that's how do i know but we're
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.680]   also seeing companies like one of the things that really impressed me about core weave we had a slide
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.000]   on this i can't remember what the what the number is but like people are starting to understand how public
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.440]   market thinks and i do think they executed incredibly well on the timetable in terms of how they release
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:45.520]   information how they explain the business model this is kind of slide 75 for people at home so we have
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:52.080]   better ipos yes that are being rewarded and another thing that struck me is we looked at the cohort of
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:59.760]   ipos right and by and large you can see unsurprisingly that growth and profitability yielding a rule of 40
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   was kind of the average of the cohort so um i i thought that was bullish for the ecosystem and then finally
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   um you've talked about this on the pod before but the m&a environment coming back different types of
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:19.440]   structures zuck's bold move right to pay a hundred percent of a company to only get a hundred percent
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:26.800]   of the price 49 of the company by the team urgency is now i need you tomorrow uh alex to help me fix my
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.240]   business right i thought that that i thought that was the best description of the scale deal that i've
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.720]   heard and maybe just click on that again for a second so you know as you know for the audience most people
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:44.320]   know that you know meta has has done this interesting structure deal they're buying 49 percent of the
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:50.560]   company um they're paying a 30 billion valuation so they're paying effectively 15 billion they're
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:58.000]   avoiding regulatory scrutiny uh the ceo of scale is going to help lead efforts uh at meta and all the
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.600]   customers have left right and so they're leaving kind of a shell company behind also we don't know
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.760]   if that avoids regulatory scrutiny exactly we're gonna find out we're gonna find out right right
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:17.040]   so uh i don't know what the if there's a breakup fee or not it'd be interesting to see yes i i don't i
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.960]   don't know that either but i mean i think one of the things it shines a light on is the speed at which
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:29.520]   everything is moving right here we are and we can all say that that zuckerberg's in beast mode
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:35.920]   meta is one of the greatest companies you know on the planet he's extraordinarily focused uh on getting
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.240]   ai talent but why do you think he was willing to pay a hundred percent of the value of a company and
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.960]   only get 49 is it that the imperative to have talent today is so important because two years from
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.760]   now you may be so far behind given the rate at which ai is moving yeah i i tend to think it's
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:59.680]   related to two factors right one is the size of the prize yeah so i think he clearly sees that this
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.760]   is the biggest prize in tech right in the world frankly and so i think relative to his while 15
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.280]   billion to all of us is a massive number probably in the scale of the multi-trillion opportunity that
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.440]   he sees he might just think it's a bet i would make all day long so i think you get it as a
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.640]   percentage of your market cap and you say like a one percent right correct right so he so i think
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.480]   that's number one scale of the opportunity no pun intended and i think number two is how quickly the
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:32.800]   ecosystem is moving under some data point i mean people had this view already that that llama wasn't
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.880]   quite at the top but this is somewhat confirmatory of that that he's fixing a problem right we've seen
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.000]   anthropic we have data in here that i think it took him about a year to get to their first billion in
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.920]   revenue it took him three months to get to the next billion and then it took him two months to get to
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.240]   the one the next billion after that right so he's probably seeing how quickly chat gpt is growing
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:01.920]   social users how quickly um anthropic is growing business users through their api and thinking i don't
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:08.640]   have two years to wait in european regulatory uh purgatory i have a question for you thomas on the ipo
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:16.320]   so so so simultaneous with seeing more ipos which is awesome there there has been a trend for companies
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:22.720]   to stay private longer i think the collisons used to hint maybe and now they're more kind of maybe never
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.400]   and and some investors in the ecosystem are encouraging that behavior what what do you
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:36.000]   think is different about the people that choose to go out now that the windows quote open i think um
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.760]   i mean they each have different reasons some may have uh just view from the financing opportunity the
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.480]   ability to tap the public market both on the equity and the debt side to be simpler right as a public
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.760]   company i think that's the big piece of it second look it could be a brand defining event for a
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:58.320]   company right for for your product for your employees giving the level of transparency to your customers
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.840]   that you're well funded that you have a fortress balance sheet you know all of that you can with
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:11.120]   withstand the regulatory scrutiny that comes and even just the um the scrutiny from investors right that
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.800]   you have the discipline and and with everything that comes public people looking at your numbers so all
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:23.680]   of those things right i happen to believe that all these companies should go public um i also think
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.480]   by the way there's there's a democratic element to it where i think the wealth creation belongs to the public
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.320]   market um i think you attract different types of investors not just frankly a public market versus
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:39.440]   a private market but also the retail investor what can you learn from the retail investor either
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.600]   positive or negative about your business right i mean i think it's a it's such an important point
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.520]   and i've made this case to everybody at open ai i think they're the most important company of the era
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:56.080]   i think it's hugely important from a regulatory scrutiny and from the democratization of finance
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:01.840]   it needs to be a public company the idea that we're going to have trillion dollar companies
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:07.120]   and the only people who get to participate are the people sitting around this table right i just think
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.240]   is unhealthy for our capital markets yeah and the fact the fact of the matter is you know we call
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.120]   these companies venture-backed companies but you we all know there's a whole new market that's evolved
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.800]   here that i call quasi public these are companies over five or ten billion dollars in value they would
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:29.760]   have all been public 10 or 15 years ago why because the the private markets just didn't have the depth of
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:35.360]   capital to serve these companies and their voracious capital needs to do you know this is happening as
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.560]   we speak in private equity right some private equity companies just go from a private equity owner to
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:46.320]   another then you have continuation funds right big second transaction this is happening in the private
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.720]   credit market where now you have a huge private credit as an asset class not just so this sort of healthy
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:58.400]   tension between public and private is important i just think that these super super large private
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:07.040]   companies if you're not willing to submit yourself to sort of the sunshine and the and the ray of light
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:13.120]   the public markets you're going to get it through a regulatory agency so pick your poison and be
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.800]   careful that if you think you can live in the public market purely to sort of live in the shadows that's
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:25.680]   not going to work as you become a large company you'll be regulated and so that's why maybe even more
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   correct that's why i really hope that these companies will choose to go public uh you make the democrat you
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:39.520]   know retail investors should have access to these companies but i just think in general the concept
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:45.920]   of mark to market it's not perfect and there's increased volatility but every day we learn something
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.360]   and every day we know it's the it's the price you can get today by the way i thought one of our best
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.200]   speakers who made this great point of just because i'm public doesn't mean i need to change how i run my
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:03.680]   business well maybe maybe we talk about app loving on slides 91 and 92 you had the 91 is has microsoft
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:10.880]   reach peak employees and 92 was about how app loving has gone ai first and had massive uh you know
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:17.360]   margin expansion or revenue per employee i i tweeted about this the other day i called a game the golden
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:23.840]   age of margin expansion right if you look at the mag 7 over the last three or four years they've grown
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:30.560]   over 20 percent compounded but the number of employees their opex is growing at two percent we've never
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.160]   seen this yeah in the history of technology you know that we've covered so why don't you talk a little
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.920]   bit about it you know well are you guys can you describe this yeah i loved this chart on 91 and
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.720]   previously what we had is we just had the chart without the blue lines right right which basically this
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:53.360]   chart for those listening tracks microsoft employee count what we realized when we after we did this chart is we
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:59.920]   realized wow there's actually three distinct chapters that are um kind of uh being told
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.240]   here chapter one is the zirp era it's covid software is everywhere the only way these companies think
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:12.400]   they can grow is by hiring more people exactly reflex big opportunity i got which by the way made sense
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:19.040]   because if you grow by producing more code you need more people for more code so i think it was
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:26.800]   completely logical we gotta hire more okay so that's the zirp era then ironically just as github copilot
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:33.600]   comes in brad familiar with the term the get fit era this is like time to get fit hold on we need to
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.280]   get fit we've gotten too big right and then you can see stabilization of headcount down in a lot of other
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:46.880]   companies now we're entering the ai era and i do think it's kind of a provocative provocative question
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:52.720]   which is that has microsoft reached the peak employee and while they never cross that threshold ever again
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:48:01.120]   right i i you know i i had conversation with the cfo of a major company recently and they said thought
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:10.800]   experiment what if our headcount was down 50 percent in three years right those questions have never been
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   asked for companies that are growing and thriving and i do think what i get excited about from as a
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.680]   public market investor philippe it's not just that we're seeing a re-acceleration and top line growth
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.640]   for all these companies every one of these companies literally from uber they're growing their top line
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.840]   without growing their headcount all the way to the largest of the mag seven but apple oven has done as
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:37.920]   as good a job as tell everyone about this slide you put yeah so this is another one of my my favorites
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:44.160]   right and what this slide does is it will track app loving a public company run by a brilliant in my
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:51.600]   opinion generational entrepreneur um and it basically looks at two things one it looks at uh the revenue of
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:59.920]   the company annualized uh since q2 2021 so that's uh the blue line and second the um employee count
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:06.880]   over that same period right and basically 2021 big opportunity i gotta hire tons of employees
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:12.160]   to kind of try and capture it what else can i do right then realizes oh my god my company's gone too
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.120]   big i've lost control of my culture we're not innovating fast enough too many layers of bureaucracy
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:23.680]   we're not set up to capture the opportunity right sizes the workforce at the same time as ai comes
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:30.640]   in now the company's lean and mean innovates out competes companies like google and meta doubles the
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.400]   size of the company as the employee count is down over 35 right think about this we just showed the
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:45.120]   the slide of chat gpt going parabolic google losing right page views google has 187 000 employees open ai
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.280]   2700 we're not going to be a company of 20 000 employees he didn't say we're not going to be a
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:57.920]   company of 187 000 employees right he's saying we're going to leverage our models our agents our capabilities
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:03.040]   which is exactly what jensen huang said to us last year he said brad i'm going to 3x the company
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.360]   and our head count may not grow or only grow a little bit i said how he said because i'm going
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.800]   to have agents who are reporting to me i'm not going to have employees who are by the way i'll tell you
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   what this made me think of so back to the app loving slide so in five years four years they doubled the
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:26.320]   revenue per employee and now you know a company with a high growth rate that's profitable that's thriving
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:34.800]   is lowering head count um because of ai it it it really struck me that there's a level of confidence
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:40.160]   in a company's use of ai if they're willing to actually reduce head count and a lot of companies
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:46.560]   give lip service to their using ai but a willingness to reduce head yes is a different level yeah and by
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.440]   the way one point adam would make if he was here and i think it's important to state he's not doing
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.720]   this because he's a masochist that loves to fire people right the reason he did this is he believed
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:01.920]   that that's the shape the company needed to be in to win and out compete yeah right so i think that's
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:07.200]   really important it's not like oh my gosh all of a sudden i i want to be much more efficient and i think
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.080]   that you know i can create so much more value it's i believe this is what the company needs to look
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   like so i can win this market we need to make decisions faster we need fewer layers right i think the
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.200]   motivation is really important um and this is just kind of an output of that and and the final thing
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.240]   i would say about this philippe the thing that should give us confidence about this productivity
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:33.840]   explosion in the economy is at the end of the day our economic productivity is just a combination of
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.640]   all these companies so if a lot of companies are doing this and you could you pile them all together
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.840]   right you're going to get more output for a fixed amount of labor and capital right that's
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:49.200]   going to drive economic productivity the last thing to say on that which is really important is someone
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.920]   is going to then say my god what's going to happen to employment yes if we have all these companies
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   that become so efficient right and i think today someone brought up the concept of jevons paradox yes
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:06.080]   and i'm going to actually use my chat gpt to study a little bit more over the next week or so but it is
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:14.320]   the concept that uh sometimes as uh you have less employees and the cost of employment goes down
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:20.400]   actually the unemployment rate will go down not up and i'm really summarizing it in terrible terms
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   but i think it's really important to say um that uh it's possible that companies need less employment but
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.960]   more companies get created because it's much easier to create a company smaller companies
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.480]   vibrant companies get created jobs become more interesting and so i think there's going to be a
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:45.520]   big debate around okay all this ai is it going to increase or reduce unemployment and i'm not 100 sure
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.640]   what's going to happen but if you force me into an answer i have faith that it might actually create
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.600]   more jobs more interesting jobs with more responsibility versus the other way around
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:02.960]   um yeah we have two more slides we want to cover that i think maybe we're going to end with the best
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.080]   because you guys had a couple powerful things um the first was slide 98 right after all of this you know
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.840]   covering you know uh what's happening in public and what's happening in adventure thomas i think you
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.560]   summed it up well which is okay so what does this mean for me if i'm a founder if i'm a
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:26.400]   a ceo what does this mean for me or or my company so bill why don't you let me let me describe what
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.960]   thomas did and then thomas you can do the analysis from it but he created a quadrant you know and on
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:42.080]   on one access he has a growth rate above 25 or below 25 and on this access you have profitability
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:49.360]   either you're cash flow positive or you're not and so walk us through kind of your recommendation for
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:55.120]   companies that find themselves in each of these four quadrants yeah and philippe chime in too um
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   look we we're very proud of the work that we put in this deck but we also want to be mindful that
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:06.080]   it's a lot of data and we thought about how do we crystallize everything that we see in the market
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.000]   from all the data all the smart people that we talk to in terms of generating useful advice for
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.960]   entrepreneurs right and so we kind of came up with this matrix if you look at the left side which is
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.560]   basically growing companies growing in excess of 25 right and you might argue this is kind of the
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:29.600]   easiest bucket you're growing 25 but we do think the delta is kind of different and and by the way one
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:36.640]   thing we skipped over you guys had two or three slides on the fact that growth has become more scarce in
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:43.680]   in the public market and there's a and there's a big um delta now in revenue multiple for growth
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:49.600]   and for you know and and obviously diminishing multiples for correct so we have seen in the
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:55.920]   public market now growth be re-rewarded post 2021 so our advice being to entrepreneurs that if you are
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:01.440]   growing over 25 percent you are profitable time to think about whether you should be public yeah but
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:06.160]   that doesn't necessarily mean go in public as you well know there's a difference between being ipo
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.440]   ready and going ipo but we think certainly putting all the steps into place kind of starts to make sense
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:17.360]   if you're burning then now might be the time to build a fortress balance sheet we just saw open
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:23.600]   ai raise 40 billion right these companies are accumulating massive war chests so you don't want
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   to lose out time to really kind of built up your strengths i think where i think you're going bill and
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.000]   what we you and i spend also a lot of time thinking about is what about the companies that aren't going
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.640]   25 and you know for philippe and myself we take the responsibility of having invested in companies
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:48.240]   really seriously we're on the boards of many of the companies that we are invested in and we don't uh
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.600]   bail on our entrepreneurs you know when we make those commitments so what do we do kind of in those
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:56:01.840]   companies right i think each bucket is interesting the okay i'm growing less than 25 but i'm profitable
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:06.320]   it's kind of an interesting case study because that's where you might be complacent you might
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.520]   have said look i got fit post 21 you told me to cut my burn yeah i'm profitable now
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.680]   by the way the reason i think a lot of companies ended up in these low growth situations is they had a ton
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:25.600]   of capital we had that mini correction in 2021 everybody said get to cash flow break even they
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:30.560]   all ran that way but that meant cutting headcount cutting programs that they might have been doing
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:37.360]   yeah and you end up in a low growth situation yeah so we thought that actually this bucket now
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:43.200]   we're in a potentially generational transformation and architecture shift because of ai time to maybe look
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:49.440]   at and say okay what can ai do for your business is there a new way that you can invest is there an
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.480]   mna opportunity or something interesting so we think now you can afford to be a little bit more on your
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.440]   forward foot right you've gotten the business healthy you've shown you can be profitable we have a
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:05.200]   generational architecture shift time to kind of see how we can play offense would that even include maybe
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.840]   becoming unprofitable potentially yeah if if if you have the science and you really start to see the
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.360]   growth re-accelerate because of it potentially absolutely yeah right a lot of ai companies
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.960]   are not profitable right now so if you think you can win and you can benefit um i think that makes
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:29.680]   sense yeah this is probably the one i had the most debate about both myself with with with with
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:36.880]   others is what to do if you're growing less than 25 and you'll you're still burning capital and look
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:42.400]   obviously no one chooses to be in this position right circumstances of the business whether it's
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.480]   competitive dynamics or others have put you in this position and now the question is what to do
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.440]   and i went through a lot of different um iterations here and the best word i could come
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:56.000]   up with is it's time to reinvent and reinvent could mean a lot of different things so let me
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.040]   pause it that you might have two businesses let's say you were 50 million in revenue and you might
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:09.280]   have your 40 million uh core business not really growing the unit economics are tough but maybe you
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:15.680]   think and maybe it's an on-premise product and now you think you made it a new sas uh cloud product
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:21.360]   that's maybe only one or two million in ar but it's really growing quickly it's putting the company back
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.720]   on offense the team's really excited might be time to say hey let's go all in on this new product even
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.760]   though it's much smaller right that's one reinvention so it might be you have a gem of an asset it might
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:36.080]   be trying to open source something that previously you didn't right that's kind of what i mean by
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:41.920]   reinventing yeah it's it's the opportunity of looking at this moment and thinking what can i do and also
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.240]   realizing that you as an entrepreneur have an opportunity cost of not doing other things so
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.720]   the best word i could come up with is reinvent it's going to mean different things to different people
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.400]   but we thought now was the time to kind of um think about that i i i thought this was amazing and i i
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:02.000]   will tell you that i think one of the biggest challenges that these companies in this quadrant
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.720]   i think there's a lot of them there may be a thousand of these out there one of the big thing
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:13.040]   problems i think they have is having survived to this point and having succeeded let's say they have
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:19.600]   revenue of 50 to 100 million dollars they feel like they need to protect something and it puts them on the
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.800]   back foot not the front foot it makes them conservative and i like your word reinvent they
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:31.200]   need to increase risk they actually because i i think one of the problems is they don't they don't
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:38.720]   internalize the fact that if they stay low growth at this size their multiple could go from five to three to
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:44.640]   one right time's revenue and they're protecting something that doesn't exist so that i'll leave you
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:49.040]   with this last thought brad you and i've talked about this there's an amazing element of the venture
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.800]   community they choose them to be tribal and i think there's a lot of benefits to that
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.840]   but i also think there's a lot of benefits to what i'll call more mercenary thinking right
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.640]   which is more reinventing from the ground up right and i think that ultimately the combination
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.680]   of both of those right which tends to be more of a public mindset again because we do have
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:15.520]   the ability to sell and venture um don't to us bringing those two kind of strains uh together
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.400]   in the boardroom you know can yield hopefully some good outcomes awesome thomas thank you for
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:27.040]   being with us thank you for having us at the event um it's really incredible the amount of thought that
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:33.760]   that went into this is extraordinary um and i would just say on behalf of all the founders uh those
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.040]   people who partner with you like altimeter and benchmark um what i love about this ecosystem
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.960]   most people think that we compete like dogs and uh but the truth of the matter is uh you're one of
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.760]   the first people i call or philippe when we're having when we're trying to figure something out
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:55.040]   and and you guys to us and that's why bill and i do this pod because we actually just want to be
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.040]   smarter and get to the right answer um and so appreciate you having us and uh an awesome job
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.880]   again okay thank you so much
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:15.840]   as a reminder to everybody just our opinions not investment advice
