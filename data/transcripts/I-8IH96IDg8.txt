[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.820]   Because he was short enough still to where I could play off of him and get his shots.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.100]   Then he got to the point where he could get it off so quick that his handles were good
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.100]   enough.
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.100]   I jump out there, he's gone.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100]   You know?
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.100]   No, he would make me want to suck it.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.900]   When I was in fifth and sixth grade, I didn't have any hair or anything, so I was shorter.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.200]   There was a dude who was taller than me.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   Then I started to sprout up.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   You and Jason Taylor?
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   You know when I picked it when they were younger?
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.200]   So at that age, he could still shoot it from here.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   He was going to push up.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200]   It was like this.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200]   I used to shoot like this.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   I used to shoot like this.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   When did you start jumping?
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   I don't know.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000]   You know, I tried to get him to stop when he first started.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Because!
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500]   You saw the way that shot looked?
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000]   I used to shoot from way back here.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Just like push it up.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Yeah, like that.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Stroke it.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   You should shoot both ways.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I can't figure out, bro.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I used to literally shoot like this, Sean.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I was probably in the fifth grade.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I would shoot from way back here.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I would just push it.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Like, straight up.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800]   I was like Dave.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   I was like Dave.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   Hey.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:55.780]   So, let's go.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:25.760]   So, let's go.

[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   So, let's go.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   So, let's go.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   So, let's go.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   So, let's go.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   So, let's go.

[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   He only won games when this.

[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   That is elite.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   This is a 2025 new Sky Dweller with the green dial on the Oysterflex.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   Normally they don't ship watches, but I'm out here in L.A.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   So he made an exception and shipped it out here.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   Green dial.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   What?

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   Back to work.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   What's the requirements to become a pup?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   You see, the thing about being a pup is, there's no requirements.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   It's one of those things, like if you know, you kind of know, you know what I'm saying?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   Like, you can't become a pup overnight.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   This shit takes time to become a pup.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   You see, the thing about being a pup is, there's no requirements.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   It's one of those things, like if you know, you kind of know, you know what I'm saying?
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   Like, you can't become a pup overnight.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   This shit takes time to become a pup.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   You know what I'm saying?

[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:32.020]   um but like in terms of like environment like a cold environment a hot environment the pool
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.600]   you know what I'm saying I like I like summertime I like summer I don't like being cold
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:17:05.080]   to be honest like really like these two for a really was like I'm just I'll just be bullshitting at the crib and they was just like bro you gotta make music like you got a little voice to you we'd be in the crib and we just throw on beats and we'd be freestyling and he was always like our freestyles was
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.040]   trying he was going crazy nice he was going crazy all that way hold on and then yeah
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.980]   everything you took it kind of serious
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:22.540]   how ain't dirty cub how ain't gia how ain't maybe trust how we do my place how ain't playing chain how ain't eat is

[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.600]   yeah like we used to play basketball together growing up and everything like that
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.220]   that's why
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:40.720]   that's why
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.220]   that's why
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.720]   yeah

[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.220]   yeah and then the one thing like is like ever since that day that I told him you should take it serious like
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.460]   he saw vision and he's been grinding it and then he hasn't had like that breakthrough moment but it
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:59.020]   hasn't like discouraged how long ago is that and I mean this is we were in college eight years ago and
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:04.180]   then like like slowly he got better and better then he started taking it serious and like he's just waiting on that
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:11.600]   breakthrough but like the fact that he's still at it just you know knowing his time will come is I feel like a testament to work ethic
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.140]   you know I went to my place I went playing change
