[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.920]   All right.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   We now have a question from Laya.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.920]   So Laya's going all the way back here
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.720]   into the deep cuts of the Deep Questions podcast archives
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.920]   here and asks about episode number 37.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.960]   In episode 37, she asks, you talked about friction flow
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   finalization stages of project execution
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.680]   and different rituals to use at those stages.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.640]   Could you please elaborate on how this approach
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.760]   to project execution--
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.480]   on this approach to project execution
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.280]   and give examples of rituals?
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.800]   Well, I like this question because it
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.640]   reminds me of a good idea I had that I forgot about.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.240]   So I'm basically impressed with myself
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.640]   as I now remember what it was I was talking about.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   This would probably been the summer of 2020.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.720]   So as a reminder for those who are newer listeners
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.880]   to the podcast, the friction flow finalization stages--
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.040]   I was trying to break down.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.480]   When you're working on a big project, an important project,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.440]   there really are three stages you go through.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.320]   So the friction stage comes up first.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.000]   It's where you're trying to get things rolling.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.480]   I call it friction because this is hard.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.280]   You have to figure out what's needed for the project.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.680]   You have to gather resources.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.320]   You have to get people on board.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.640]   You have to stare at the metaphorical blank page
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.520]   and write those first words.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.120]   It is pretty hard to get past that initial friction.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.520]   It's not a fun part of most projects.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.320]   Ask any book author about what that first week of working
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.120]   on a new book is like.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.080]   But then you get to stage two, which is flow.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.040]   Now you're rolling.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160]   You know what the project is about.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.360]   You have the resources.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.180]   The first steps have been made.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.560]   You've got those first indicators of progress.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.920]   And now you can lock in and move that ball forward pretty fast.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.560]   This is the stage that most people like with projects.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   It's where the writer now is at their lake house
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.720]   and doing 3,000 words a day.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.560]   The muse is there.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.360]   The words are flowing all as well in the world.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.280]   Then finally, you get to this finalization stage.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.580]   At some point, as you get towards the end of a project,
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.320]   there's a lot involved in bringing this in for a landing.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.400]   I think my count now is four metaphors so far
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.280]   in talking about projects.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.000]   So this is good.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm going to see if I can figure out some more.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.720]   But the final stage is, OK, I got
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.120]   to get the manuscript polished.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   We have to copy edit it.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.840]   I have to go back and fill in these details.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.400]   There's fact-checking notes I need to get in there.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.200]   It can be technical.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.000]   It can be annoying.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.160]   But sometimes finalization can be
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.000]   one of the most important stages because it's
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.560]   where you take all this work and you tie the ribbon
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.960]   around that package--
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.000]   metaphor five-- you tie the ribbon around that package
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.920]   really nicely.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.240]   And it makes all the difference about how it's received,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   regardless of what's inside.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.440]   So that's also an annoying stage.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.560]   So what I was arguing in episode 37
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.000]   is that you approach each of these stages separately.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.200]   So when you're in the friction stage, the key thing
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.840]   is you actually have to just put in that brain power.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.640]   Because it's a difficult stage, you probably
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.840]   want to break that up into smaller bursts
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   that you do regularly.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.520]   So when you're really trying to get through that friction stage,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.960]   it's every day this week, one hour.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.560]   It's just one hour.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.120]   So painful or not, I know it'll be over in an hour.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.840]   But every morning, 8 to 9 before I go to work,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   I'm spending an hour working on this particular project.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.640]   So that's probably how you want to think about that.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.360]   Timing matters.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.760]   Location matters.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   Here's my cup of coffee.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.280]   This is all about tricking the brain
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   into actually doing the work.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   So that's the type of ritual you want to care about.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   This is a different ballgame.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.560]   Now you're enjoying what's going on.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   Now what you probably want with flow is big sessions.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.160]   Big sessions that are scheduled for you to really
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.840]   get lost in the project and make the really cognitively
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.080]   demanding high-quality contributions.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.520]   So now what I want is Friday afternoons for the next month,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.120]   I'm doing these four-hour sessions
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.240]   where I leave work early.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.960]   And I'm going to whatever, the little cabin
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.800]   I have on this property by the lake.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.160]   And I just get lost in it.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.760]   So now you're really trying to extract the very highest
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.160]   quality thought from your mind.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.920]   This is different than the friction stage.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.120]   The friction stage is there's a lot of annoying stuff
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.520]   I have to do before I get started.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.120]   So I just need to make sure that I put in those cycles.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.680]   The flow stage is like now I need
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   to get lost in the thought and produce the best stuff
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.200]   possible.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.640]   It has to be enjoyable.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.400]   It has to be long enough sessions
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.080]   that I can extract real value.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600]   So probably there you want rituals
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.520]   built around making this into an almost romantic setup.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.760]   You're going to a cool place.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.440]   You're spending a long amount of time.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.720]   You have the really nice coffee.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.080]   You end the day with a bourbon.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.880]   Now it's really about extracting what you can from your brain.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.920]   Finalization, we're back to friction.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.560]   All right, man, what a pain.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.320]   So shorter sessions, same time, same place,
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.440]   again and again and again.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.020]   It's about getting back to the cycles,
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.160]   getting those things done.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.960]   I don't want the dragging out of finalization
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   to drag out this project much farther than it needs to go.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.360]   So you're back more towards how do I trick my brain into just
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   do work, just do work.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.400]   It's only an hour.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.520]   We do it every day.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.600]   Don't even think about it.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.400]   We have no choices.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.360]   What we do from 8 to 9.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.520]   You're back to that type of mindset.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.440]   So Laya, I like this question because there's
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.720]   a more general point that's being made here, which
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.040]   is how you approach work should depend on what exactly
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.000]   that type of work is.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.360]   And you should be suiting your habits
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.540]   to what you're trying to do.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.360]   So thank you for reminding me about my own genius here.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.560]   Friction, flow, finalization, treat those stages differently.
