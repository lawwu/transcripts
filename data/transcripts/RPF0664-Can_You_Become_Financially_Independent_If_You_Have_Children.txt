[00:30:51.980 --> 00:31:21.780]  ã‰. So, I'm gonna go ahead and say that I have three children. Maybe if you had a smart car as a couple, it doesn't work. You need a third seat. But a little hatchback still does. A little four-seat hatchback will work fine if you have one child. And then if you want to do fun things, you want to travel the world, well, you can still get by on a small sailboat or a little tiny RV. There's not a lot of big expense there with having one child. You will have significant costs in things like clothing. For example, you have a child. That means now that you have to acquire new clothing for that child and that can be a major ongoing expense.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:51.620]  , because they grow so quickly. And there's no real efficiency of reuse from multiple children. If you have four children and you have sets of clothing that you buy for the first one, with the exception of a few things that get worn out, most of the clothing can be handed down one by one. But you probably have cousins or nieces or nephews. You could probably get a lot of clothing donated as well. So, there's not going to be a huge increase there. You will have costs that you incur for education of the child, depending on what structure you use for that. Those costs are going to be a huge increase.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:32:21.460]   They might be substantial hobbies, classes, et cetera. But one child only adds modestly to the household budget. Two children, still very modest. There are costs that will significantly increase. From now on, as your children grow to a point where they eat a normal adult-sized food, which happens pretty quickly, if you go out to eat, you're going to have double the restaurant cost if you have two children than if you were a couple. You're going to have double the plane ticket cost. But there are still things that are not so much more.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   You can have a lot of things that are not so much more.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   But there are still things that are not so much more.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   You can have double the restaurant cost if you have two children than if you were a couple.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   You can have double the plane ticket cost.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   But there are still things that are not so much more.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   You can have double the plane ticket cost.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:51.300]  , but you can still fit in one hotel room when you travel.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   You get two beds, but you can still fit in one room.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   You don't have to double your hotel rooms.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   The small house is still doable.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   You can still fit in a small car.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   You may have a higher cost of clothing.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   Maybe you have a boy and a girl.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   Now you have two wardrobes that you have to buy, and you don't have any efficiency of reuse.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   But you can handle that in other ways.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   Now when you get to three children, there does start to be an incrementally higher cost.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   You now have a massive increase in your plane tickets, your restaurant costs.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   It's double, more than double.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:51.540]   renders you a little bit more expensive.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   You're getting five meals instead of two.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   You're getting five plane tickets instead of two.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   You're getting five plane tickets instead of two.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   Now you're at the point where you will probably need to be committed to a bigger house for the duration of your child rearing years.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:33:03.540]   Now you're at the point where you will probably need to be committed to a bigger house for the duration of your child rearing years.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.340]   At this point, you're probably going to be on track for a three-bedroom house, especially if you have both boys and girls.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.740]   At this point, you're probably going to be on track for a three-bedroom house, especially if you have both boys and girls.

[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:25.980]  , but if your children start to grow pretty large, it's going to be physically tight.

[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.980]   You start to get some broad shoulders on boys, you start to get some broad hips on girls.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.020]   I remember when I was younger, my parents were trying to buy a smaller minivan.

[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.020]   One of the things was they stuck me in the back seat and they looked at it and said, "This little minivan is not going to work for us."

[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.020]   I had to get a full-size van.

[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.020]   Your children get bigger.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.020]   Your children get bigger.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.020]   The costs are incremental with three.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:34:07.060]   The costs are incremental with three.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   For children, you start to get tougher.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.060]   Restaurants, very high.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.060]   You're paying three to six times more than a couple would pay at a restaurant.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.060]   You're paying three to six times more than a couple would pay at a restaurant.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.060]   Three to six times more for plane tickets.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.060]   Instead of one or two plane tickets for a single person or a couple, you're now at six.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.060]   That adds up.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   These days, I buy six plane tickets.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.060]   That makes it much more substantial to get on an airplane.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.060]   That makes it much more substantial to get on an airplane.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.060]   You probably have outgrown one hotel room.

[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.100]   It would be a very rare hotel room where you can fit four children and two parents
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.100]   in that hotel room.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.100]   When the children are small, you can do it, but as your children grow, you're pretty much
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.100]   locked into two hotel rooms when you go somewhere.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   You're definitely going to want a larger house.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   You start to outgrow most cars and SUVs on the market if you have four children.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.100]   You start to outgrow most cars and SUVs on the market if you have four children.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.100]   You can still fit into something like a double cab pickup truck if you have bench seats front and back,
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.100]   but it's tight.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.100]   You can still fit into something like a double cab pickup truck if you have bench seats front and back,

[00:34:40.200 --> 00:35:01.140]  , you can't get by with an F-150 anymore, you need the F-250.

[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   We're the only family I ever knew who had a microscope like that.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   Most children, of course, have the microscope in school, but we always had a nice, fancy,
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   expensive microscope.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   Well, if you amortize the cost of a microscope, you're going to have a very expensive microscope.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   Well, if you amortize the cost of a microscope, you're going to have a very expensive microscope.

[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   You can perhaps justify some of those expenses.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   The counterargument is, of course, maybe you have more money if you have one child, and you can easily justify it that way.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   The point is that there are some benefits there.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   I think you can make some good arguments that you are providing your children a better circumstance if you have multiple children, better growing up circumstance.

[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:59.700]   and the financial independence. I find that the most insane of concepts, except that's the primary metric, especially mothers labor under this burden that somehow they have to produce more financially in order to be worth more. My husband will love me more if I make more money. It's crazy. So let's assume that you're not making financial decisions based on the money, the finances, but that you are seeking to work within the constraints of your situation toward financial independence, even perhaps while you're caring for your children.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:29.720]   I would say first, let your larger family give you the personal motivation to earn more money. I think, personally, it's easier for you to become financially independent, even perhaps if you have five children, if you have a household income of $500,000 and household expenses of $100,000, then if you're single, casting about, earning $40,000 per year. You're going to have an easier plan to financial independence, earning half a million dollars per year, even if you have five children.
[00:59:59.740 --> 00:59:59.740]  æ•¸ing a half a million dollars per year, you're going to have a lot of money. You're going to have half a million dollars per year, even if you have five children, even if you have six children, you're going to have half a million dollars per year.
[00:59:59.740 --> 00:59:59.740]   First, the data's on your side. People who have children tend to make more money. As I stated earlier, I think there is a causative influence there, not absolutely not.

[00:59:59.740 --> 00:59:59.740]   But if you're going to have a business, you're going to have a better business, then you're going to have a better business.

[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   when at that phase of life, I did not have the goal of being
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.420]   financially independent at an early age.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:25.840]   I had a fairly stable life. I had a stable, profitable business.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:56.100]  , I was making excellent money.

[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:54.840]   I was right in the middle of everything. We could walk to the library, walk to the grocery store. I was less than a quarter of a mile from my office. So I could walk to work. And I did. And it was great. And I loved it. And so I went ahead and bought the house because we thought it was the perfect house at the perfect time. But it did make a major change. But we didn't have early financial independence as a goal. I didn't foresee any reason why I would ever need to change my career. I had total time freedom. I could come and go. And so I didn't see the benefit of being a housekeeper.

So how do you adjust your financial independence plan to the phases of your life? Well, here's what I say. If you don't have any money, rent a small, cheap apartment, whatever the smallest, cheapest thing is. Maybe you live on a sailboat. You can live on a sailboat as a young, married couple and save a ton of money. If you're in England, you can live on a riverboat. If you're in the United States, you can live in a sailboat.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   You can live on a sailboat.

[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:34.880]   I'm a student of life. I study what people do and I try to do my best with the limited information that's presented to try to understand how people think, what they see, and just to watch people. There's a channel that I found years ago on YouTube. I'll use YouTube channels. You can look up these channels if you want. Years ago I found this YouTube channel because it was on RVing and it's called Gone with the Winds, W-Y-N-N-S. The protagonists on the channel are Jason and Nikki Wynn. And for a long time, they were on the same channel.

[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:30.640]  obedived.com/BTSMGPKG. And I think mom is the primary video editor, but the children do all the family voiceovers. And I was recently comparing, both channels had an episode recently where they had some engine trouble. And in the one, in the winds, Jason is down in the engine compartment working all by himself. Where in the other, Keith is in the engine compartment, he's got his two teenage children helping him, working with him, etc. The joy, the hijinks, the fun, the fulfillment of Zatara seems to me much more fulfilling.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:30.640]   The joy, the hijinks, the fun, the fulfillment of Zatara seems to me much more fulfilling.

[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:59.580]   Now, that family with four children has had years of work. But they're sailing the world with their children. They've been on the, sailing full time for the last two years. They had to buy a much bigger boat. They've got a five bedroom, five bath catamaran sailboat. Jason and Nikki's boat is smaller. So they had to spend more money to buy a bigger boat. They had to spend more money on just about everything.

[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.180]  . I think they have enough savings to keep them going for now. But after they were on the road for a while, they had to figure out a source of income and they started to do that together and the father does speaking and some coaching, etc. They're not financially independent, but they're at a phase of their life where they're with their children constantly at that very tender age that children and adolescents go through in their teenage years. And I look at the fun that they're having the father just celebrated a birthday, I can't remember the fiftieth birthday. The joy of that birthday was tremendous, at least that I could see in the same time.

But there's also just a joy and a liveliness to their lives. Now they're in Europe traveling all over. Don't tell me it can't be done. They got 12 children can't discern that they have a lot of money. I think that as a programmer, again, kind of a redneck looking RV, but you go back and you watch those videos. And is it bedlam?
