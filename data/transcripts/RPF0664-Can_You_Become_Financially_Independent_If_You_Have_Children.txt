[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.440]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we tackle this theme. Joshua, it seems like most of the
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.800]   proponents of FIRE, financial independence and early retirement, are either single people or
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.760]   childless couples. Do you think it's possible for families to achieve financial independence as well?
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:46.480]   [Music]
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Well, today we're going to talk about it.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.840]   Do you think it's possible to build a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.080]   if those 10 years involve your being very busy and involve your budget being burdened with the
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.800]   many expenses of children? [Music]
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.560]   Question comes in in inspiration from a listener of mine who writes in from Australia. Writes in
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.680]   about a number of different things, but ultimately talks about this. This listener is newly engaged,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.120]   planning to be married very soon, and says, "I despise having to take out a mortgage from a bank,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.840]   which is one of my current joy-sapping tasks, only to be in debt for 30 years just so I can
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.200]   put a roof over my future family's head. Previous generations were raised to simply accept this as
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.360]   part and parcel of being a man and providing for your family, but the more I think about it,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.480]   the less empowering it actually is. We've created a society where due to the constant need for a
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.040]   growing economy, housing affordability is at an all-time low. Nearly 35% of my take-home pay will
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.400]   go towards paying off a house for the majority of my working life. Talk about wage slavery.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.640]   Financial freedom seems almost impossible for couples that want to marry young,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.520]   have children, live on a single income, homeschool children, have a big enough house for their needs,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   have a level of stability in terms of not moving around and living in close proximity to family
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.440]   and support networks, etc. The whole FIRE movement seems geared to single people who are happy to
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.240]   work seven days a week for the best years of their life, or do so with a partner for even more
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.520]   income, never have children and retire at 40, having lived a selfish life with no legacy left
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.560]   behind. I recall your talking about what would make you happy on your deathbed, an extra zero
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.760]   in your net worth or children and family around you, and I couldn't agree more with your answer.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.360]   Joshua, perhaps an episode on what financial freedom would or could look like for young
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.040]   families in our situation would be interesting. Thank you. Well, this is interesting to me,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.160]   and I will talk about it. And I'm actually intentionally choosing to talk about it now,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.120]   where my wife and I are today. You might consider this show something of a marker in the sand,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.040]   because I will record my thoughts here in the midst of the thick of it with young children,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.240]   and then we will see how my thoughts work out in the coming years. And you can judge for yourself
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.280]   in the coming years if we are able to accomplish our FIRE goals and FIRE plans, or if our goals
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.080]   are destroyed by our young family. For context, my wife and I have four young children, four
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.840]   children under the age of six, five and under. And any of you who have four children certainly
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   know that that is a challenging phase of life. Young children are certainly challenging in and
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.040]   of themselves. One is a challenge, two is a challenge, three is a challenge, and four is even
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.800]   more of a challenge. So when you have four young children, five and under, life is very different
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.920]   than it was a mere six years ago when we were a couple without any children. And yet, things are
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.640]   not as easy as I expect them to be in 10 years. Not necessarily easy, but you know what I mean.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.880]   It's one thing to travel with children who are independent and able to take care of themselves
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.200]   and able not to hurt themselves in some way. It's another thing to care for young children.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.600]   And of course, there are many financial ramifications to this as well. But I am
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   committed to two things. Not necessarily with equal commitment, but I am committed to these
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.360]   two things. I love my children. I wish to care for them and provide for them. And I
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.880]   value their presence in my life. I also wish to be a diligent steward of the resources that I have.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.160]   And I wish to progressively work my way toward financial independence. And I have aggressive
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   goals in that direction. So are these things contradictory? First, let's begin with the
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.360]   question. Is retiring early? Is FIRE, early retirement financial independence, is it harder
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.200]   with children than without? In my answer, the obvious, in my opinion, the answer to that
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.880]   question seems obvious. Absolutely. It seems obvious to me that it is absolutely harder
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.960]   to become financially independent at an early age with children than without children.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.520]   I see no way to advance the argument that somehow children are going to help you to be
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   financially independent faster or sooner. I don't see any line of argument that I could make in
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.120]   that direction. Rather, children are going to make early retirement and financial independence harder.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.160]   They're probably going to make it take longer, and it's going to be more difficult on the process.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:59.360]   But is FIRE impossible if you have children? My answer is no. It's absolutely not impossible.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.920]   So let's begin with the basic formula of financial independence. This is the same for everybody,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   no matter whether you are a single individual, a married couple without children,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.120]   married couple with children, single parent with children without, I guess you wouldn't be a single
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.680]   parent without children. You get the point. It's the same for everybody in every life stage,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.400]   in every circumstance. The basic formula of financial independence is this. You need to
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.000]   earn income. You generate income in some form. Then you have expenses that are incurred to
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.320]   maintain yourself and your family in the lifestyle that you have chosen. If your expenses are lower
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   than your income, you generate savings. And then that savings needs to be invested well,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.040]   and the better you can invest that savings for financial growth, the sooner you can get to a
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.320]   point at which you can live on the income from your investments. And that is the definition of
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.280]   financial independence that we are using today. Your ability to live and maintain your lifestyle
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.160]   on the income from your investments. When you can live on the income from your investments,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.400]   you are then by definition freed from the need to work for wages to support yourself and your
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.880]   family. And the idea is that you are freed from that need for the rest of your life.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.200]   Now, if we accept that this is the building block of financial independence, and we look at the
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.240]   problem, we recognize that the fastest results, the people who can achieve financial independence
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:34.080]   fastest are those who have a very high income, very low expenses, and who can generate very high
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:41.200]   investment returns. So what results in the highest levels of income? Well, you are the people who
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.680]   earn the highest levels of income are generally those who produce extremely valuable work and
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.160]   who work very, very hard at it, and often who work very, very long hours, long hours of hard work
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.720]   that is considered to be valuable in the marketplace generates you high levels of income.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.440]   What about those who have the lowest expenses? Well, those who are able to minimize their
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.080]   lifestyle expenses to the smallest amount for living small living cheaply, very efficiently,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.360]   those people are able to have the lowest expenses. And then what generates the highest investment
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.520]   returns? Generally, that would be applying large levels of time and energy and skill to your
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.560]   investments to earn outsized returns. Now, the question is this, do children help with any of
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   these things? The answer is obviously no. Children don't help with any of these things.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.920]   Parents with children, or at least parents who value their time and effort with children and
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   make a priority of their relationship with their children other than a priority of working.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.560]   Parents with children simply cannot work as much as those who don't have children.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.920]   For me, this has been one of the biggest costs of my children. My work week is necessarily shorter
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   than it would be without children. I cannot maintain the same levels of work that I maintained
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.720]   five years ago. It's simply not possible for me to simultaneously work the number of hours in a
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.080]   week that I would like to work and also provide the care for my children and the care for my wife
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.680]   that I believe they deserve, that's important to me to provide for them. The time and energy that
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.160]   young children require of you is substantial. They suck your time, they suck your energy,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.560]   and it's necessary to provide for them. A number of months ago, we were in a particularly difficult
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.280]   time, and I was having lunch with my dad and he was asking me how things were going, and I said,
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.760]   number one prop in my face right now is figuring out how on earth to build time to work. There
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.640]   were some weeks, a number of months ago, where I was lucky to work 10 or 15 or 20 hours in a week
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.440]   simply because the demands of my children, the needs of my wife, the needs of our household were
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.320]   so substantial that I couldn't carve out more than 10 to 20 hours in a week to work. And so,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.840]   there's no way that you can argue, that I see, there's no way that I can argue that somehow
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:07.360]   children help you to do longer, harder work. Now, there may be, we'll come to exceptions in a
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.800]   minute. What about expenses? Well, the expenses of your household if you have children are
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:20.000]   necessarily higher at almost every level simply because you are supporting more people. And those
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.200]   people come with all kinds of extraneous expenses that are not there if you have fewer people.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.800]   And then investment returns are, in most areas, probably harder to achieve. Whether it's due to
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.760]   the amount of time that you can invest, it's just harder to make better investment returns. You're
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.600]   limited on the amount of time. Now, that might be where you have the most flexibility. For example,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.320]   if as your children grow and they become more useful to do work, maybe you could do something
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.640]   like use the extra manpower that you have to buy and fix and flip houses and clean up the property
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.880]   more quickly, etc. But if you compare even those benefits that we could perhaps argue for to the
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:05.280]   total amount of time required over a lifetime, that seems hard to me to argue. So, it seems
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.880]   obvious that children are not going to help you become financially independent faster.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.080]   They're simply not. They're going to be a drain on your time, on your money, on your non-financial
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.160]   resources. They are going to make it harder and longer for you to become financially independent.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.760]   Now, the only line of argument that I think could be explored is there does seem to be some
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.440]   research to indicate that married men, I don't know if it's both married men and married women,
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.400]   at least, probably not because most women, their earnings go down when they have children because
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.040]   they spend more time with their children, become stay-at-home moms, etc. But there does seem to be
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   good evidence indicating that married men earn a higher level of income and in time generate a
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.320]   higher level of wealth than unmarried men. And I've often wondered about that and thought about
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.680]   that. I've wondered, is there a – and when you look at the correlation between higher income,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:08.880]   higher wealth, and fatherhood, is it a correlation or is it a causation? I'm not yet convinced of
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.480]   the answer to that. I've not seen the data that would indicate that you can prove causation.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:21.680]   I look a lot at my own psychology to see if I can see one or the other. For me, I am increasingly
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:28.720]   convinced that being married and having children is a causal factor in my earning a higher income.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.320]   Personally, I find having children to be very motivating for me and to be very financially
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.080]   motivating. When I assess myself today versus, say, eight years ago before I was married,
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.720]   before I have children, I simply do not struggle with the things that I struggled with eight years
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.200]   ago. I don't struggle with all those silly things about, "Oh, I don't feel like getting out of bed,"
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.880]   or "I don't feel like going to work." I don't struggle with motivation or any of those things.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:01.440]   And I don't think it's just related to chronological advancement of age, chronological age,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.000]   because I have a number of friends who are my exact same age who went through – have gone
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.560]   through similar life paths. Many of them are entrepreneurs. But the ones that don't have
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.720]   children and who are unmarried in many ways seem to struggle with those exact same things that I
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.960]   struggled with when I was in college. Many times they seem to be ruled by their feelings and how
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.120]   they feel at a certain day, whether they feel like working or don't feel like working. Many of my
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.120]   friends seem to be fairly drifting in their life. They don't seem to be particularly focused.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   And I just don't – I don't struggle with those things like I did when I was younger.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.920]   And so I am increasingly convinced that there's a causal factor to higher levels of motivation,
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.320]   higher levels of work ethic, higher levels of life organization. You simply can't be a father
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:57.280]   and have your family run at all smoothly and run your life in the same way that you did when you
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.640]   were single. The kind of haphazard approach to life where you go with the flow and don't plan
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.840]   ahead, you don't think ahead, that seems to necessarily change when you become a father.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.960]   I know a number of men who are older, never married. And when I compare their lives and
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.480]   their same haphazard approach, they seem to be stuck in this endless immaturity,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.920]   this sense of drifting where they don't make clear plans. They don't – they're not on top of things,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.960]   really. Now, I don't think that it has to happen. I don't think that I'd recommend having children as
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.920]   financial motivation, necessarily. I don't see any reason why a single man can't develop himself to
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.040]   be focused and productive and to plan ahead and to deal with all those psychological weaknesses,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.640]   etc. But I do think that there is a causal influence where children in many ways have caused,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.240]   at least in me with my own personal experience, major psychological changes. And those changes,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.480]   I think, have served me well. Even things like self-confidence. I compare my own personal levels
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.240]   of self-confidence, and because I've long been a student of confidence, I've long watched and
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.200]   observed my own lacks of self-confidence, I'm convinced that having children and leading a
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:26.000]   family has instilled within me far higher levels of self-confidence than I would have
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.680]   if I continued to be single. Even if I had the same level of chronological age, I'm convinced
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.840]   that simply the responsibilities and the experience of leading a family has given me
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:44.080]   much more self-confidence. Again, I compare myself to my friends and peers, who, a few of them that
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.720]   I am very close to, unmarried, no children. And of course, I have many friends who are married
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:55.120]   with children. And I see marked differences in the level of personal self-confidence from those
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.160]   of us who have children. I think back to, and I've often thought, what if I went back and became a
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.960]   financial advisor? If I started over today as a financial advisor, I could with my current,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.040]   I started in the business 11 years ago, I could with my current levels of personality and
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.880]   self-confidence change and do what previously took me three or four years, I could do it in a year.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.520]   And part of that might be to academic study, advanced chronological age, but I am convinced
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.880]   a big factor of it is the leading of children and the leading of family. When you recognize
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.720]   the responsibilities that you have towards people who depend upon you, and when you become accustomed
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:42.000]   to leading and directing a family, you simply don't care about other people's opinions as much,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and you necessarily have to take a leadership role. So, I'll continue to watch it as years go by,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   and if any of you come across good sociological data on the subject, I'd be interested to read it,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.040]   because it's something I think a lot about. Is there a causal factor between children and
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.280]   being a husband and a father to increasing levels of income and increasing levels of wealth?
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:15.200]   It's a question. But I'm increasingly convinced that for me, there has been a causal influence.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:21.280]   It's not just correlation, it is causation. But again, I don't think it's necessary. I would never
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.440]   tell a single man, "You have to get married in order to be more productive in your life or to
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   build greater levels of self-confidence." No, there's too many risks, there's too many dangers
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:36.000]   to marriage and children to make that argument, but it does seem to be a benefit that comes along
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.120]   with marriage and children. So, with that caveat, let's continue. My opinion is this. Reaching
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.280]   financial independence will be harder and more time-consuming for you to do if you have children,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.440]   but it's not impossible. Now, I don't think the question is going to be solved by simply financial
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.960]   analysis, because I don't think that really any of us would use financial independence as our
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:08.640]   primary, ultimate goal in life. And this is, I think there are some young devotees of the
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.760]   financial independence philosophy who do hold this as a primary goal in life. And they seem to think
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.400]   that this will be a transformative thing, that once they reach financial independence, everything
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:27.600]   will be fine. To me, this is simply a mark of youthful exuberance and immaturity. And there
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.320]   are plenty of mature people in the financial independence space who would caution that
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.720]   youthful perspective and say, "No, you're going to be the same person you are before financial
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.040]   independence as you are after financial independence." There may be some personal goals
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.880]   that you can pursue more, some things that bring more joy to your life that you can have the
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.520]   freedom and flexibility to pursue after financial independence. But I don't think there's really
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.000]   anybody out there, at least anybody with some maturity, who would say that financial independence
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.480]   will be the defining thing in your happiness. Happy people will probably be happy before
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.080]   financial independence and will be happy afterward. And miserable people will probably be
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.640]   miserable before financial independence and will be miserable afterward. So to me, that seems the
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.000]   expected perspective of most people who are mature. Most of the focus on financial independence,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.600]   I think, where it does get out of whack comes from those who are, again, expressing a youthful
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.520]   exuberance. And in time, with more life experience, that will probably be tempered. But I don't think
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.960]   there's anybody out there that's building their philosophy around financial independence as being
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.720]   the thing in their life. And so that's also not going to affect your perspective towards children.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.080]   I think ultimately, your more basic level of worldview will be the thing that drives you,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.320]   and then you look to see how financial independence fits in. Most people probably don't think that
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.960]   much about their philosophy of children. There are people who are very pro-children. There are
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.840]   people who are very anti-children. But most people seem to take life as it comes, and
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.720]   they—children happen organically or they don't happen, and they just simply adjust as time goes
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   on. I do personally have a deep level of concern for what seems to me to be an increasing rejection
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.440]   of children. You see this a lot in popular culture right now, at least in the United States. You see
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.360]   it in Europe as well, from the British royal family to popular musicians and popular politicians.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.840]   There's people who sincerely seem to be having this intense personal moral struggle about whether
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:42.080]   it's ethically right and morally right to have children. And I feel very sad and a great deal
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   of empathy for people who believe that. I remember reading one young girl's essay that she wrote on
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:56.000]   this, and she poured her heart out. I think she was in her early 20s, and she wrote this really
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   desperate essay where she poured her heart out about talking about how desperately she wanted
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.720]   to have children, but she had this intense ethical turmoil about doing so because of the impact that
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.480]   her children would have on the environment. And she was worried about global warming and the world
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:14.960]   blowing up, and it's just really remarkable. But ultimately, I think the underlying philosophies
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.200]   will be much, much stronger than any of the financial philosophies, whether you value
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:26.000]   children, you value human life, or you don't. So once you decide those things, once you decide
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.400]   if you are in the perspective of humans are either a blight upon the earth – you see this a lot right
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   now, where if you take the extreme form of some worldviews, many people seem to believe that
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.520]   human beings are the greatest curse upon the face of the earth. And it's almost like some people
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.400]   dream that if every human being were vaporized from the surface of the earth – I don't know,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.560]   raptured, you know, disappeared from the surface of the earth – then somehow this would make the
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.040]   greatest thing that could happen, because now the earth would be in its pure and perfect form,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.920]   and things could flourish, and the carbon would go down in the atmosphere, and volcanoes would
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.720]   blow up less, and wolves would be able to roam the streets of – or roam the empty,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.040]   grown-over streets of New York, and everything would be great. The buffalo could return to the
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:20.960]   prairies, and the – I don't know, the great white shark could regenerate itself and rule the seas
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:27.680]   again. That seems to be some people's perspective. I don't hold any of that. I see human beings as
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   the single greatest resource that the world exists. I have zero fear whatsoever about
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.400]   somehow in the future – I mean, they've got the same tired, like, Malthusian overpopulation stuff
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.480]   that has been so utterly disproven in time over the decades, but it doesn't seem to die. It's
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.640]   this crazy philosophy that seems to continue on, even though there's no evidence for it whatsoever.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.320]   Or people talk about, "Oh, well, the natural carrying capacity of the earth is 5 billion people,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.560]   or 1 billion people, or whatever their magic number is." It's absurd. The single greatest
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.440]   resource on the face of this earth is human ingenuity, and the human beings that exist.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:13.360]   And every single problem that we face as a human species, we will solve it by the human resources
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.280]   that we have. There is no problem today that is unsolvable. And to think otherwise is the most
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.880]   destructive, self-defeating philosophy. So, you may have guessed, I don't buy this in any way.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.120]   And it's this most remarkable expression of pessimism when people feel that their own
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.840]   species is not worth propagating, that their own family is not worth propagating, that the
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:41.200]   highest and best good that they could do is to make sure that the human race stops with them,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:49.600]   and practically that they just fold up and die too. And you see this sense of pessimism
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:56.000]   that grips people, and they're stuck in this catastrophic viewpoint of the world that everything
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.120]   is falling apart and everything is dying, and there's no internal confidence to actually go
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.800]   on and build a brighter and better future. But rather, the sense of morose, foreboding
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.320]   catastrophism that results in them being depressed and wanting to end things every day. It's crazy.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.240]   Now, there do seem to be some strong religious trends. If you study the global populations,
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.440]   there seems to be a high correlation between theism and people who are increasing. In general,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:32.160]   you see if you study religion and non-religion, you generally see that the most fundamentalist,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.920]   highly religious sects in different religions tend to be the ones that are growing, and that's
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:43.680]   having a transformative influence on culture, and so that's fascinating to watch. But I guess,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.440]   at the end of the day, it comes down to your philosophy, you know? Do you see people as a
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.480]   blessing, as a good thing? Or are people fundamentally a bad thing? For me, it's fairly
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.080]   simple. The Bible says, "Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it." And so, I see
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.960]   human beings as the single greatest thing, the single greatest resource on the earth.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   The basic commandment for people is love God and love your neighbor. We can't love your neighbor
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.000]   if you're simultaneously looking over at them and wishing they were dead and gone.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.560]   And most fulfilling experiences in life are enhanced by our community and sharing those
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.880]   with other people. So, it's not to say that parenthood is easy. It's certainly not. I doubt
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.200]   there's a parent out there who doesn't question if they wouldn't be happier at times without the
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   work and the challenge that their children bring them. Just like probably there's not a couple out
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.000]   there that has chosen not to have children that wouldn't look over at parents and say,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.080]   "Sometimes I wonder if we should make a different choice." I think most of us who are parents would
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.400]   admit that as much as we love our children, there are a lot of things in our life that are difficult
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.680]   without them. But at the end of the day, you have to choose. Or throughout history, most people
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.760]   haven't had to choose. It just kind of happens naturally. But today, increasingly, people feel
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.600]   that they have to choose. And so, it's going to go down to your philosophy, your philosophy of
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.280]   the value of people, the value of humans, what you're here to do. And in many ways, your positive
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.360]   feelings and optimism about the future or your pessimism about the future. So, you'll have to
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.480]   settle that yourself. But I don't think that financial independence is going to be the thing
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.480]   that makes the difference for you. So, assuming that you've settled it and assuming that you
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.840]   are in a situation where you've said, "Okay, I've got children," or "I'd like to have children,"
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.800]   does that mean that I've got to kiss off financial independence? Does the fact that I'm having
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.200]   children and I've got these two little children here in my household mean that for the rest of
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:50.960]   my life, I'm going to be stuck? I just can never grow financially? My answer is very loudly, no.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.160]   Now, we need to, again, acknowledge reality. In my opinion, there's no question that children
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.080]   will increase the costs of your life and your lifestyle. And there are some important inflection
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.480]   points for you to consider as you even consider the size of your family. For example, many people
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:15.040]   who do have children today are choosing to have only one child or possibly two children. The
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.680]   number of families today that have only one child or two children is at a historic high. There's
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.880]   never been a period in history where so many families have chosen, so many parents have chosen
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:34.560]   to only have one or two children and then restricted their, through whatever circumstances
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:41.600]   or means, chosen not to have any more children. That's a really unique and modern development,
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:48.320]   and it's having very substantial influences on the world today. In some cases, it's having
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:54.080]   catastrophic influences on the world today. But it is fascinating to analyze it from a financial
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.960]   perspective. One child adds very modestly to the household budget of a couple. I guess before I
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.880]   even go to one child, we should talk about the financial benefits of being single versus the
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.520]   financial benefits of going through life as a married couple. That one's a little bit more
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.600]   difficult because a lot of it will come down to the quality of your relationships. If you are in
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.560]   a very low quality, contentious marriage relationship, in many ways, I think you can
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.720]   make a good argument that it's a lot better to be single. You have a high degree of freedom
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.960]   and independence. You can easily disassociate yourself from people that you don't wish to be
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.120]   with. Whereas when you're married, you can't do that. You're married, you're in it for life,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.400]   you are in it. Whether it's happy for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, you're in it.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:44.080]   Now, financially, I do think the best financial arrangement, the most efficient financial
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:50.640]   relationship arrangement is going to be with two people working together. You can have such
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:57.200]   economy of expenses. It's cheaper for two people to live together in one house than it is for two
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.920]   individual single people to maintain two separate houses. When you can add your income together,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.560]   you can mutually support one another. One person is going to go to school, one person's going to
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.840]   start a business. Well, if the other person is earning wages, they can support that other person,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.440]   which makes it so much easier to go to school to increase your earning power or to go through the
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.720]   temporary financial shortfall of starting a business. So two people married is vastly superior
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:27.520]   financially to two individuals. There's only a reduction of cost when two people get married
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.920]   versus the cost of maintaining two separate households. But it's not necessarily the same
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.840]   way when you have children. So one child adds very modestly to the household budget. In general,
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.880]   I'm going to ignore things like birth expenses, not that they're immaterial, but simply that
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.240]   they're a one-time expense that is not repeated and they can be calculated. They're not insubstantial,
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.880]   but they're a one-time expense. The more important expenses are the expenses that continue throughout
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:59.280]   childhood until the age of adulthood. So for example, one child to go from a couple of two
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.440]   to a family of three means that there's going to be a 33% increase in your restaurant costs when you
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.960]   go out to eat. There's not necessarily a 33% increase in cooking at home costs, but there
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.520]   will always be a 33% increase in restaurant costs. There'll be a 33% increase in plane ticket costs.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.200]   Whenever you go somewhere, you buy three plane tickets instead of two plane tickets. That's a
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.720]   really substantial cost. But some other things are only going to be marginally affected. Maybe
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.200]   you'll might have to have a slightly larger house, but you can still get by with a small house if you
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.120]   have one child. A two-bedroom house is adequate. A two-bedroom, one-bathroom house is certainly
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.760]   adequate. You need a little more space than perhaps the couple could get by with in a tiny
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:46.000]   studio apartment, but a small house is still adequate. So only slightly larger expenses.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.240]   And frankly, you can stick one child just about anywhere. If you have a small closet in your
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.680]   studio apartment, you can convert that closet into a perfectly serviceable bedroom for one child.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.360]   Most of the world lives that way. Most of the world doesn't have these huge extra bedroom for
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.760]   one child. They convert a small closet or a small little room where the child can have a private
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   bed. You probably don't need a bigger car if you have three children. Maybe if you had a smart car
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.840]   as a couple, it doesn't work. You need a third seat. But a little hatchback still does. A little
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.480]   four-seat hatchback will work fine if you have one child. And then if you want to do fun things,
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.720]   you want to travel the world, well, you can still get by on a small sailboat or a little tiny
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:29.040]   RV. There's not a lot of big expense there with having one child. You will have significant costs
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.080]   in things like clothing. For example, you have a child. That means now that you have to acquire
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.480]   new clothing for that child. And that can be a major ongoing expense for children because they
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.880]   grow so quickly. And there's no real efficiency of reuse from multiple children. If you have
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.520]   four children and you have sets of clothing that you buy for the first one, with the exception of
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.320]   a few things that got worn out, most of the clothing can be handed down one by one. But you
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.680]   probably have cousins or nieces or nephews. You could probably get a lot of clothing donated as
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.440]   well. So there's not going to be a huge increase there. You will have costs that you incur for
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.000]   education of the child, depending on what structure you use for that. Those costs might be small or
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.280]   there might be substantial hobbies, classes, et cetera. But one child only adds modestly to the
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:20.240]   household budget. Two children, still very modest. There are costs that will significantly increase
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.320]   from now on as your children grow to a point where they eat a normal adult-sized food,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.080]   which happens pretty quickly. If you go out to eat, you're going to have double the restaurant
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.960]   cost if you have two children than if you were a couple. You're going to have double the plane
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.240]   ticket cost. But there are still things that are not so much more. You can still fit in one hotel
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.760]   room when you travel. Yeah, you get two beds, but you can still fit in one room. You don't have to
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.880]   double your hotel rooms. The small house is still doable. You can still fit in a small car. You may
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.720]   have a higher cost of clothing. Maybe you have a boy and a girl. Now you have two wardrobes that
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.760]   you have to buy and you don't have any efficiency of reuse, but you can handle that in other ways.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.000]   Now, when you get to three children, there does start to be an incrementally higher cost.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   You now have a massive increase in your plane tickets, your restaurant costs.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   It's double, more than double. You're getting five meals instead of two. You're getting five
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.520]   plane tickets instead of two. And now you're at the point where you will probably need to
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.080]   be committed to a bigger house for the duration of your child-rearing years. At this point,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.960]   you're probably going to be on track for a three-bedroom house, especially if you have
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:29.280]   both boys and girls. You can still maybe get by with a five-seat car, but if your children start
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:36.960]   to grow pretty large, it's going to be physically tight. Very rarely will a family with three
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:43.280]   children still skip by with that tiny little five-seat hatchback. You start to get some broad
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.800]   shoulders on boys. You start to get some broad hips on girls. They don't fit. At least I don't
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.520]   fit that well in the hatchback. I remember when I was younger, my parents were trying to buy a
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.320]   smaller minivan. And one of the things was they stuck me in the backseat and they looked at it
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.240]   and said, "Yeah, this little minivan is not going to work for us." And I had to get a full-size van.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   Just your children get bigger, but the costs are incremental with three.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.120]   Now, for children, you start to get tougher. Restaurants, very high. You're paying three to
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.160]   six times more than a couple would pay at a restaurant. Three to six times more for plane
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.640]   tickets. So instead of one or two plane tickets for a single person or a couple, you're now at
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:31.680]   six. That adds up. These days I buy six plane tickets. So that makes it much more substantial
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.800]   to get on an airplane. You probably have outgrown one hotel room at this point in time. It would be
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.880]   a very rare hotel room where you can fit four children and two parents in that hotel room.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.120]   When the children are small, you can do it. But as your children grow, you're pretty much locked
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.000]   into two hotel rooms when you go somewhere. You're definitely going to want a larger house.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.120]   You start to outgrow most cars and SUVs on the market if you have four children.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.480]   You can still fit into something like a double cab pickup truck if you have bench seats front and
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.560]   back, but it's tight. You're going to need a full-size pickup. You can't get by with an F-150
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.720]   anymore. You need the F-250. You can't fit in a Jeep. You can't fit in a Toyota Prius. So your
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.240]   vehicles, you need a minivan or a seven-seat SUV. And even if you get something like a seven-seat
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.560]   SUV, most of them are going to be tight unless you get the very biggest ones, a big Ford Expedition
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.320]   XL or big Chevy Suburban or Excursion or something like that. You don't get much luggage space.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:33.600]   Yeah, the Honda Pilot has seven seats, but by the time you flip down one, you don't have enough
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.840]   luggage space. They just don't work. If you're going to go traveling, you need a big RV with
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.200]   a bunkhouse. You can't just go down to 1-800-RV-4-RENT and rent whatever they have because
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.960]   there simply aren't enough beds. You don't fit on a 32-foot sailboat. You don't fit in most things,
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.160]   and so you've got to think bigger. And five children, that would be a big inflection point.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.680]   Now, generally, your plane tickets add up a lot. You officially always need a minivan. So now,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.000]   when you go on vacation, you're going to need two hotel rooms. You're going to need to rent a much
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.360]   more expensive car. You can't fit into the $12 a day car. You've got to have the $45 a day minivan.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.720]   Six children, now you always need a full-size van or you need multiple cars. You need a big house,
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.320]   etc. Now, there are some efficiencies that can grow financially with you if you have a larger
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.920]   family. For example, let's say that you already have a larger car. Many people with two children
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.640]   will drive a minivan, and it doesn't actually cost you anything extra if you're already going
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.120]   to have a minivan with two children to have a total of five children in your minivan instead
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.720]   of two children in the minivan. And it doesn't cost you all that much on your fuel mileage to
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.280]   drive around with seven people total in your minivan versus four people total. Maybe you lose
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.440]   half a mile per gallon because of the increased weight, but not much. And you gain some other
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.880]   efficiencies. You have more drivers. If you have children who are older and have more drivers,
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.160]   and you're going to drive across the country, you can drive straight through because you have
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.920]   more drivers. It's easier. If you have more children, you get efficiencies, economies of scale
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.880]   with things like clothing. You can reuse clothing from one child to the next. Things like shoes,
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:14.000]   things like books. You don't have to go out and buy a whole new set of books for the fifth child.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.280]   You've already accumulated them for one. And so there's a big difference between a couple
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.320]   and investing in a home library with one child. But a home library for one child can now be
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.200]   reused again and again for two, three, four, five, six children, however many you have.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:36.080]   Same thing again with clothing, shoes, etc. Size of housing. You don't, just because you have more
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.320]   children doesn't necessarily automatically mean that you have to go to that much of a bigger
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.920]   house. If you're willing to be cozy, you can fit things into three rooms. When I was growing up,
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:52.480]   I'm the youngest of seven children. Although at that time, yeah, there was a time in my life where
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.720]   all of us lived in a relatively small three bedroom house. Now it was tight and my parents
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   didn't do that for a long time. They adjusted their living circumstances and moved to a bigger
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.000]   house fairly quickly. But the point is, it is doable. A three bedroom house can have,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.120]   in our case, we had four boys in one room and three girls in the other.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:19.680]   So that, there are, it can be done. You don't have to automatically commit yourself to a huge
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   giant house just because you have children. There are benefits. You have more help. There's more
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.320]   cooks in the kitchen, more gardeners outside, more tutors for the younger children. And there,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:35.920]   you have more people to rely upon. For example, one of the benefits of having more than, more,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:42.080]   having children and having more children is that you can rely on your children as you go through
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:47.760]   life. Pretend you only have one child. Many couples, one child. And in later years, your
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:53.680]   child goes out and gets married to a spouse who comes from an only child family. And as is the
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.240]   norm increasingly today, they have one child. Now, pretend that you and your spouse are now old
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.720]   and you need some help. You need someone to be there with you to keep you company, perhaps to
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:13.440]   give you some help around the house. Well, very likely, your in-law child's parents are also in
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.680]   a similar stage. And so what frequently happens in parts of the world where there are changing
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.840]   day demographics and what's increasingly going to happen in the United States is that you'll find
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   that your child and their spouse, who of course is an only child, will have four old people to
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.560]   take care of. So now you have two middle-aged people who may or may not have a child to either
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.520]   have additional work for them or additional help for them, but you have two middle-aged people
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:51.200]   caring for four old people. That's really tough. That's really, really tough. That's very different
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:58.320]   than if you as the adult had four or six children and now the four or six children can share around
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.840]   the care for mom and dad. And this is one of the things that has happened demographically with old
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.920]   age welfare programs in the United States and is happening throughout much of the world, which is
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:14.000]   why it's going to be so tough on old people, is because as people started to have fewer children,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.200]   all of the math of the programs has fallen apart, where you don't have enough young workers
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.440]   working, earning money, paying taxes to support the older programs, and you don't have enough
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.560]   workers to care for all the old people. So right now things are working, but at some point in time
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.480]   there's going to be, demographically, unless there's some major change, which I don't see
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.200]   any reason why that would happen fast, at some point in time the young people are going to look
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.040]   at the old people and say, "Yeah, we can't do it anymore." And what happens then? I don't know.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.720]   But it's not necessarily a bright future for a lot of older people. And now as those government
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:52.480]   programs start to increasingly collapse, as the government programs start to have fewer funds,
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.200]   as there are fewer younger workers to care for the older people, you're going to see the government
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.840]   institutional financialized programs start to go down. Now it's a much scarier thing.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:09.680]   Imagine yourself as an 85-year-old, and yet you have one child who is not doing well
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:17.760]   themselves. Your future looks a lot scarier than if you have three children who can care for you,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.920]   and one of them has the financial flexibility and the lifestyle flexibility where they can
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:29.840]   care for you. So that may be one thing. You have more people to rely on as your children grow.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.920]   It's interesting that that's a very touchy subject for most people today.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.640]   When I used to do retirement planning for individuals who were planning to retire,
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.760]   the number one goal that most retirees seem to have is not being a burden on their children.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   Now I think we all share that, right? None of us want to be a burden on our children.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:55.040]   But what's fascinating is that that's a relatively new thing, culturally. Most historical cultures
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.440]   seem to have a different expectation of their children. Most historical cultures have seemed
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.240]   to say we invest in our children when they're young, and our children owe us a duty of care
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:10.560]   when we are older. I personally believe that's the right thing, that I owe my parents a duty of care.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:17.680]   But it is, it makes a big difference. I would say one other simple expression today would be
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:25.280]   simply the ability of, if you're currently caring for your older parents. I remember when
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:32.560]   my grandparents, I have one grandmother still alive, she's 105 years old, but when my other
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.960]   grandparents were in their 90s and my parents were caring for them, my parents built a house,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.840]   moved them in with us, wanted to provide care, we never wanted to send my grandparents to
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:48.000]   an institution. And so that care is really, really burdensome. It's really tough. And my
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.200]   grandfather had dementia, required full-time care for many years. That's very, very challenging.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:59.440]   But one of the things I'm grateful for and proud of is that at the time, my parents had children
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:06.400]   who were adult children who were able to help and relieve some of that burden. Now, my parents still
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:13.520]   bore the primary burden of caring for their parents, as they should, but some of us grandchildren were
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.640]   able to be there. At the time, I had graduated from college, I moved back with my parents,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:25.120]   and one of the reasons I did that was because I was able to help care for my aged grandparents.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.360]   My siblings also were able to do that. It was much easier for us to provide respite care
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.760]   so that my parents could get away. They weren't stuck in the same way that so many today are,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   where you have a single individual or a couple caring for parents, or often a single child
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.160]   who is a single parent caring for aged parents. It's very, very difficult.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.600]   So, perhaps I belabor that too much, but as you have more children, you have more people to rely
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.520]   on. And in many ways, there's more security, even emotional security. If you have one child
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:01.120]   and your child dies, that can be really, really tough. Obviously, it's tough if any child dies,
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.760]   but I think there's a great comfort that parents can take if they have other children to comfort
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:12.080]   them in their time of loss. I had one sister that died when she was 14 years old. And one of the
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:19.360]   things I'm very grateful for is that I wasn't one of two children. And my family, we missed
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:25.680]   my sister very, very much, very, very much. But I don't feel this just constant, never-ending
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:32.640]   pain of loss because I have many other siblings. Our family get-togethers and holiday celebrations
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:41.040]   are noisy, exuberant, jubilant affairs. And of course, there is probably a lifelong sense of
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:48.640]   loss of the death of one of my – of a sibling. But the fact is, my parents still have six other
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:55.280]   children to enjoy their old years with, to enjoy the fruits of their labors with, to enjoy the
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.840]   many grandchildren and the great riches of that. And that wouldn't be the case if they had only
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:09.600]   one child. I had a former co-worker of mine who – he had one child. And I think it was – he had,
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.480]   I don't know all the circumstances of his marriages, but he was in a second marriage with –
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.680]   where his wife didn't have any other children. They had one child. And he was extremely involved
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:26.400]   in his son's life, extremely involved. And they had many rich and rewarding experiences
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:34.720]   throughout their lifetime. My co-worker was financially extremely affluent, had plenty of
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   money, plenty of time freedom. They spent years – they bought an RV and his son was into dirt
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.200]   biking. And so, they would go all around the country in this RV and enter all the dirt bike
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:51.120]   races. He was a devoted, loving father and seemed to have a rich and rewarding relationship with his
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:57.680]   son. For circumstances I never learned, his son committed suicide when he was in his early 20s.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.440]   And I just remember talking with my friend – we weren't at the point where I ever inquired about
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.080]   the circumstances, it was none of my business. But my friend had all the money in the world,
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:14.000]   was extremely financially well off, had all the toys, the fast cars, the big boats,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.240]   the beautiful big houses on the water, had everything, and was totally set up. Retired
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:26.880]   at a very young age, pursued an active retirement out sport fishing in his big giant boat,
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:34.640]   traveling the world, big RV, traveling around with his wife. And yet, it seemed like there was this
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:43.920]   just deep emotional pain and loss that could never be changed. And he was psychologically healthy,
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.200]   but as I reflected on it, I imagined myself in his position and I thought how painful that would be.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:57.120]   How painful that would be. In comparison, I have another friend of mine who he and his wife had
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:03.360]   eight children, and two of their children have died. Their oldest also committed suicide in early
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:10.880]   20s, and one other child died in an accident. But as I looked at them, I see that through the pain,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:20.160]   through the deep pain, and I don't know what pain could go deeper for a parent than
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.360]   when a child commits suicide. I pray that I never experience it personally, but man.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:32.720]   How does it get more difficult than that? But through the pain, as I look at this other family,
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.920]   I'm grateful that they're surrounded by their children and they have this love and this
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:46.000]   comfort that comes from their other children. Now, these days, we don't think much about that,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.120]   the advancements of medical science and the advancements of, you know, we don't think much
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:58.640]   about losing children. Prior generations thought much more about it. Most of us don't.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:08.320]   And yet, I don't think it's foolish to think about it. That just the, that if you have one child,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:16.240]   if your child dies, it's, have a deep impact on your life. So, whether it's people to rely upon
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:22.080]   and having, or just the joy of that. You gain, even as you have more children, you do gain many
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:30.080]   efficiencies in many aspects of life. You gain efficiencies with child care, for example. Let's
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:36.400]   say that your husband, your wife, and you are both working. You have one child, you're paying
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.080]   for daycare. Well, financially, that sometimes works out. You have three children now. It often
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:48.560]   works out financially very superior for a mom to be a full-time mom. And so, if mom is going to stay
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:53.840]   at home and care for the children with one child or with three children, there's not a difference
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.520]   in incremental cost financially. There's certainly a difference of incremental amount of work and
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.400]   stress and skills that she has to learn to care for three children versus one, but there's not an
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.000]   incremental financial difference. You're not paying three times the child care costs with,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.400]   if mom is at home. You do, of course, have other considerations. I think every parent,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:20.800]   you wonder if there's an optimal amount of focused one-on-one time. If your time is divided among
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:27.120]   four children versus one child, there's no question that you have less time with each
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:34.560]   child with four than one, and you look at that and you think about that. But you do gain efficiencies.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:42.240]   There are many efficiencies with more children. I think you can justify some financial expenditures
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.040]   because you have more children to allow yourself to give your children a richer experience.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.600]   Example that comes to mind is when I was growing up, we were homeschooled, but we always had
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:59.120]   an expensive microscope. My parents had bought a very expensive professional level microscope for
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.760]   our science classes and science experiments. We'd go look at pond water and stuff like that.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.000]   We were the only family I ever knew who had a microscope like that. Most children, of course,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.920]   have the microscope in school, but we always had a nice fancy expensive microscope.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.040]   Well, if you amortize the cost of a fancy expensive microscope over a bunch of children versus the
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.160]   cost of one, you could perhaps justify some of those expenses. The counter argument is,
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.920]   of course, maybe you have more money if you have one child and you can easily justify it that way.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:33.680]   The point is that there are some benefits there. I think you can make some good arguments that
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.960]   you are providing your children a better circumstance if you have multiple children,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:47.120]   better growing up circumstance. For example, you're creating a family network, a tribe or a clan
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:54.880]   for your children to rely upon. And if you can maintain a positive, healthy home atmosphere
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:02.400]   and positive, loving relationships between parent and child and among siblings, I think the network
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:07.040]   that you build for your children of their siblings is one of the most valuable assets they have in
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:16.880]   life. Today, I would say that I rely on and value my siblings very, very deeply. And when you think
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:23.360]   about how to provide for somebody, when you build a support network for children and for siblings,
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:29.680]   it's a lot stronger than I can imagine anything else being created outside. And if you look at
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.720]   the world, kind of popular level, and you start talking to people, it seems like many people
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:42.320]   don't have much of a support network. Many people have difficult relationships with their parents.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.960]   Of course, many people don't, and we want positive relationships. But some people seem to have
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.800]   difficult relationships with their parents where they feel like they can't rely on their parents.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:56.960]   And they don't even have the emotional freedom to expect to rely on their parents, even as adults.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:02.000]   And then many people don't have siblings that they can rely on. They don't have those close
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.920]   bonds and relationships. And then as local communities have increasingly fractured,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.960]   unless somebody has a strong church community where they can rely on, where instead of it being,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.200]   you know, I attend religious services here, but rather they feel a part of a family,
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:24.320]   many people are going through life alone, fighting alone. I'll tell you, that has never
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.120]   been my experience. And when you talk about the confidence that can be created to pursue something,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:34.800]   to start a business, etc. When you feel like you have a deep reserve, when you feel like you have
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:41.040]   a safety net that's built up with people, it creates more confidence in you. Now, many people
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:46.000]   are seeking to use government and government forces to create that safety net, to establish
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.280]   a universal basic income and basic welfare programs, etc. Maybe, right, maybe that can
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.240]   have an influence. I can concede that that might help some people. But at the end of the day,
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.800]   a check from the government is nothing compared to the support of your brother.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:15.520]   I don't see how it can compare. And especially as the government becomes increasingly bankrupt,
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.320]   how does that compare to the support of your brother? So, if you feel like you have a wide
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:26.000]   family network with siblings that you can rely on, it creates this intense sense of belonging,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.680]   an intense sense of place. And I think that has untold ripple effects. I've only recently begun
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.880]   thinking about this, but realizing I think how important that is. I think children who grow up
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:42.320]   with multiple siblings have better social skills, have better coping skills. I recently saw some
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.520]   evidence that I'd never seen before, but I saw some evidence that children who grow up with
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:55.200]   multiple siblings have much higher rates of staying married, lower rates of divorce. Now,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.800]   I'd like to see that corroborated and dig into that. It was just, I saw it in passing, but
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:05.120]   I can easily believe that. When you grow up, learning to cope with sharing a room with
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.520]   siblings and learning how to control yourself and learning how to move together as part of a group,
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.800]   it creates, I think, a much healthier, balanced personality that makes it easier to integrate
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:23.200]   with your spouse. I think it's very challenging to raise an only child and not have that only child
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:29.600]   have this sense of entitlement. Not impossible, but much more challenging than if a child grows up
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.960]   among others. And I'll just tell you, as a child growing up in a big family, I think it's a lot
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.200]   more fun. A lot more fun. When you fact that you always have multiple playmates, you can always put
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:45.760]   together a game, a sports game all by yourself without having to get five neighbor kids out of
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:52.080]   their house, it's simply a lot more fun. We certainly aren't at this stage in our parenting,
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:56.800]   but I'm imagining a day in the future when parenting will be easier because the children
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:00.560]   can be together, they can protect one another, they can care for one another, and mom and dad
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.280]   can sit back and they can go on an adventure, and because they have built-in friends. I think that's
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:11.760]   really useful. So I share those things because I think those arguments may be underrepresented
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:21.200]   in the marketplace. I don't think that those give financial proof that a family with children is
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.160]   going to become financially independent earlier. I acknowledge that firsthand. But I think they're
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:31.920]   offsetting benefits that are probably under-discussed. And if you focus on everything
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:38.480]   financial, and the only lens through which you view things is the dollars and cents, I think
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.920]   you've got a very shallow, thin, and inferior worldview. This is one of the things that deeply
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.640]   bothers me and troubles me about our modern society, that we have a tendency to bring
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.960]   everything back to measurements in terms of dollars. I believe dollars are a very useful
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   measurement. They're a very useful barometer. But when you...they need to be kept in their place.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:07.040]   And it really bothers me that increasingly many people measure even their self-worth,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:14.080]   not by who they are as a person, not by their ontological reality in the world,
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:21.200]   but based upon their earning ability. And people measure one person versus another and say,
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.960]   "Well, I earn this much, and this person doesn't earn this much." And there's this intense
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.040]   class warfare, especially in the United States, where the culture is so fixated on money. And
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.600]   everyone's, "Well, men earn more than women, and women earn more than men." And I look at those
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:40.720]   arguments and I think, "Do you really value yourself exclusively based upon your annual
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.680]   productive income, your personal GDP, your growth, your personal output, economic output?"
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:52.560]   To me, that seems the thinnest and most depressing of statistics to measure yourself on
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:57:03.840]   rather than your ontological worth, your...rather than your role in life, your husband, your father,
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:10.560]   your wife, your mother, your son, your daughter, a valued member of your community,
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:16.880]   your good neighbor, your loyal citizen, you are a helper of those in need. Is that not more
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:24.400]   important than your annual income? And it's...everything always comes down to annual
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.360]   income. It's really, really, I think, a really destructive worldview to measure your worth
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:38.880]   by your net worth, to measure your contribution by your income. It's not that net worth can't be
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:43.440]   a useful metric. It's useful to track your productivity. I think it's very important to
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:50.160]   track your net worth because it's a barometer, it's a metric that you can judge to see your
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:56.320]   general efficiency with productivity. It's a measurement of your productivity.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.400]   But that doesn't mean that if your net worth is declining for a good reason, that you're
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:09.040]   worth less as a person. And the same thing with your income. Do we really say that the person who
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:18.400]   makes $500,000 a year is a more important member of society than my wife, who makes $0 per year,
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:25.840]   and yet is pouring out her life into molding and shaping the lives of children, and who lays down
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:32.320]   her life into molding their character and shaping and forming their personality so that they grow
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   into mature and stable adults? Is it really more helpful and more valuable if she goes and becomes
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:45.520]   a top-flight attorney, making $500,000 a year, so that we can hire people to do that work with
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:51.360]   our children? I find that the most insane of concepts, except that's the primary metric.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.160]   Especially mothers labor under this burden that somehow they have to produce more financially
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.880]   in order to be worth more. My husband will love me more if I make more money. It's crazy.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.120]   So let's assume that you're not making financial decisions based on the money, the finances,
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:11.840]   but that you are seeking to work within the constraints of your situation
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.360]   toward financial independence, even perhaps while you're caring for your children.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:21.840]   Well, I would say first, let your larger family give you the personal motivation to earn more
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:28.400]   money. I think, personally, it's easier for you to become financially independent,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.360]   even perhaps if you have five children, if you have a household income of $500,000
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   and household expenses of $100,000, than if you're single, casting about, earning $40,000 per year.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.000]   You're going to have an easier plan to financial independence, earning half a million dollars per
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.720]   year, even if you have five children, than if you're single, earning $40,000 per year.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:53.840]   So I see no reason whatsoever that you should simply say, "Well, I have children, thus I can't
[00:59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.080]   make a lot of money." That's silly. Let your motivation and even just the duties and the
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.880]   responsibilities that you have motivate you to earn more money, motivate you to build a better
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:11.200]   business. First, the data's on your side. People who have children tend to make more money. And as
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.240]   I stated earlier, I think there is a causative influence there. Not absolute, but there is a
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.320]   causative influence there. My opinion and reality is this. Most people don't make much money
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.520]   because they never decide to make much money. And they never pursue that as an important goal.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.600]   Most people have never set an income goal in their life or made a plan as to how they could double
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.560]   or triple or 10x their income. And so because they never decide to do it, they never specify
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.720]   it and state it clearly as a goal, they never do it. Because they're never tuned into the
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.320]   opportunities to do it. They're never tuned into the ways to do it. They're never thinking about
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.200]   how they could accomplish it. Now, can you do that as a single person? Of course you can.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.240]   Any single person could set out a goal and say, "My goal is to double my income. My goal is to
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.320]   make $100,000 a year. My goal is to make a million dollars a year." And there are many people who
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.120]   will accomplish that, never marry whatsoever, never have children, and accomplish those goals.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.560]   So of course that's possible. But it's certainly a little bit more important, probably, to people
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.240]   when they have others who are depending on their income. That was my experience. I never have
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.600]   cared that much about making more money. I generally have always been more comfortable
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.280]   just simply simplifying my goals and expenses. If I were single, I'd probably be living in the
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:37.200]   back of a pickup truck parked out in some random national forest land in Utah, staring at the red
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:45.040]   rocks every day, reading nonstop, living on $5,000 a year. Because I've never cared that much about
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.920]   making a lot of money as compared to indulging my own lazy streak and sitting around and enjoying my
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.200]   intellectual pursuits. Knowing what I know now, I would bet you that's where I'd be.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.840]   But yet, I don't want to stick my wife in the back of a random pickup truck and tell her,
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.000]   "Figure out how to live here and stare at the red rock cliffs." I'm not going to do that.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.880]   I'm not going to tell my children, "Yeah, we're broke, but we're going to live in this cargo
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.280]   trailer in the middle of nowhere because we can do it cheap, and I'm not going to provide any
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.320]   interesting opportunities for you." That's absurd. And so I embrace a totally different perspective,
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.520]   and I have a much deeper level of motivation and a much more useful, greater use of money
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.840]   than I would if I were single. So I say embrace it and let the goals, let the things that you
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.320]   desire to create and provide for your children, the experiences, the opportunities, the things,
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.600]   the relationships, the opportunities, let that motivate you. And instead of sitting around being
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:50.960]   a dirt bag, living in the back of your pickup truck, earn a million dollars a year and let
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.680]   that motivate you. I think that's powerful and may move you in the direction of financial
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:06.000]   independence. I think you can adjust your family lifestyle to an efficient mode of operation
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.920]   and gain from those benefits. The reality is a dual income, no child household,
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.880]   where both parents work for wage, both adults, both people in the, in the, the husband and wife,
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.040]   a dual income, no child household, where both people work for wages is absolutely the least
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.040]   efficient financial life possible. It's the most inefficient financial plan I can imagine.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.240]   You have extremely high taxes that come in on earned income. You have very few deductions,
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.000]   no business deductions available to you, not even any deductions related to children,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.200]   no child tax credits or whatever the equivalent is in your country. You have no family business,
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.760]   you have no built-in helpers. If things are bought, you buy everything with after-tax income.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.360]   It's extremely inefficient. Now you don't have to have children to adjust it to be more efficient,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.240]   certainly not. Just because a couple doesn't have children doesn't mean that they can't both run
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.080]   their own businesses. They can and they should if they're inclined towards entrepreneurship,
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:16.800]   but adjust your family structure and use what you've got. If you have a dual income household
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.960]   and you have a child and now mom stays home with the baby to pour her life into that baby,
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:30.720]   you probably won't lose all that much spending power that can't be made up in other areas.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.320]   You're going to have lower tax rates, you're going to have more efficiency at home,
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.680]   better family frugality, so just simply use that as a benefit.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:47.280]   Now, remember, and this is especially to my listener who is engaged, not yet married,
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:55.360]   remember that you have different phases of your life and you can build your plan efficiently while
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:01.120]   also simultaneously incorporating your children. If you are engaged and not yet married, I would
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:08.560]   caution you and say this, you do not need the same lifestyle as a newlywed that you might need if you
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:16.880]   have three teenage children. So, plan accordingly. When you are newlyweds, and this listener
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:23.360]   especially was not distraught but annoyed with the fact that because they value having children,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.200]   that they're going to be locked into an expensive house in the suburbs and they're just kind of
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:34.400]   going to be stuck into the normal wage slavery of life. I deny that. I deny that wholeheartedly.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.840]   Keep your expenses super cheap, especially before you have children.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.880]   When my wife and I were married, we rented a really cheap apartment. We had a tiny 243
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:51.440]   square foot studio apartment that we rented for $500 a month. Take advantage of the efficiency,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   the financial efficiency of that phase of life. Prior to that time, she was renting the apartment
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:02.800]   for $500 a month and I was renting for, I think more than that, I can't remember now, but at least
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:09.520]   $500 a month. I think it was more than that. And so, our per person cost for apartment rental
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.600]   went from, let's just pretend I was running for $500 a month myself. You take two people running
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.320]   at cheap, which is that's certainly cheap, $500 a month and bring those two people into one. Now,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:24.000]   your monthly rental cost per person drops at $250. And because you, maybe you maintain both
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.800]   your incomes, now you have an extra $500 of savings. Just because you marry doesn't mean
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.960]   your life has to get more expensive. Let it embrace the cheapness of it. Live cheap, live small.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.320]   Even when you have children, the vast majority of baby expenses are unnecessary.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:51.920]   Now, most first time parents think they are necessary. And then after you've had a few
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.160]   babies, you pretty much simplify and you don't really need the vast majority of the stuff that
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.840]   you get. There is a joy, especially that your wife will experience of creating a beautiful nest. And
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.320]   it's nice to be able to provide that. It's nice to have your wife develop a beautiful nursery and
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.760]   have it painted just how she wants it and have her stencils just how she wanted it and a beautiful,
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.080]   perfect bedding. It's fun. And it's really nice. And that's enjoyable. But it's not necessary.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.040]   And if you as a couple collectively share the goal of financial independence, you might simplify
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.320]   that nest a little bit. One of the things that I would do differently going back in time,
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.480]   when at that phase of life, I did not have the goal of being financially independent at an early
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:43.680]   age. I had a fairly stable life. I had a stable, profitable business. I was making excellent money.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:50.160]   As far as I could see, looking at the future, I had a fairly clear 40-year plan. I was a financial
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.960]   advisor. I had built a stable practice. I wasn't going to fail out of the business. I had clients
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:01.440]   that I liked. I didn't foresee any major changes. And so after we'd been married a year, we bought
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.080]   a house. And I was very careful and thoughtful in that house purchase. But I wasn't trying to cheap
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:11.440]   out and get the cheapest place that I could live. I was looking to get a very comfortable house that
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:17.520]   was modest because the house that you choose drives so many other expenses in your life.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.120]   So I wanted a modest house, but a comfortable house. I wanted a house that was big enough,
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.400]   big enough for children, but not too big, comfortable enough, but not too comfortable,
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.640]   small enough, but not too small. And so we shopped carefully. And I thought I found what I thought
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.760]   was the perfect house. It was a large three-bedroom, two-bath house. I had just under a half an acre
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.280]   of land right in the middle of town. I wanted to have chickens. I wanted to have a garden.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.880]   I was right in the middle of everything. We could walk to the library, walk to the grocery store.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.680]   I was less than, I think, about a quarter of a mile from my office. So I could walk to work.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.800]   And I did. And it was great. And I loved it. And so I went ahead and bought the house because we
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.520]   thought it was the perfect house at the perfect time. But it did make a major change. But we
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.880]   didn't have early financial independence as a goal. I didn't foresee any reason why I would
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.600]   ever need to change my career. I had total time freedom. I could come and go. And so I didn't see
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:15.840]   the benefit of being financially independent. I had pensions. I had passive income. So the early
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.080]   financial independence plan was simply that I could live on the passive income from my practice.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   I didn't need to have huge amounts of savings. So we bought a house, fixed it up how we wanted it.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.080]   And we made a lot of frugal decisions along the way. But in hindsight, if I were doing it over
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.960]   again, I wish we had stayed in the tiny little studio apartment. We, my wife, we had worked it
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.320]   out where she would put a baby if we had a baby. I don't think we could have had-- the toddler would
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:44.160]   have been uncomfortable to bathe, but a baby was no big deal. I wish we'd stayed in a studio
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.320]   apartment. And instead of buying a house for our own personal lifestyle, I wish we'd bought
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.120]   an investment house instead and just simply made that the first purchase. No, we didn't.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.160]   But I point out to you that you could. If you have a desire to be financially independent,
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.600]   just don't move into the hedonic adaptation phase. Keep things simple. Live in a small
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.600]   apartment. Live cheap. And maximize the time that you are a newly married couple before you have
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:15.600]   children. Don't spend money on big infrastructure expenses. Spend money on fun, on experiences.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.280]   Go skiing, go surfing, go on vacation. Enjoy that time as newlyweds. Lighten up on your
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.000]   entertainment budget. Just minimize on those other things. The best thing that we really loved about
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.960]   a tiny studio apartment, it took no time whatsoever to clean. On Saturday morning, we lived near the
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.320]   beach. On Saturday morning, we would say, "Okay, let's clean the house." And 10 minutes later,
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.720]   we'd get on our bicycles and we'd go to the beach. And that is the thing to do as newlyweds.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:45.040]   So live cheap. Live inexpensively. Now, as you start to expand, maybe you have a baby in a little
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.000]   tiny apartment, recognize that children are generally not self-aware enough to have much
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.440]   other than basic needs. A three-year-old child does not care whether you live in a huge giant
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.240]   house or whether you live in a single wide mobile home or whatever the Australian equivalent of that
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   is. A sandbox is enticing to a child, whether it's a natural sandbox at the beach or whether
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:14.960]   it's a designer sandbox at your big fancy house. So there's no reason to expand your lifestyle all
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.000]   that much at an early age. And you don't need to buy when you have young children, you don't need
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   to buy all the expensive things. Just take a picnic and go to the beach or go to the forest
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.280]   or go on a hike and think very carefully about any kind of expectations that you start to build
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:39.920]   into your children. There's no reason why you have to build children with expensive tastes.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.640]   Now, if you live in downtown New York City and you put your children into the designer daycare
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.680]   and the designer elementary school that everybody has to get into, and your children are surrounded
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.480]   by peers who have all the latest and greatest gadgets and who are spending their weekends at
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.360]   the expensive place, et cetera, you're going to build into your children expensive tastes.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.480]   And they're going to be bugging you for expensive gadgets and doing this and going to that and the
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.280]   other thing and all your money will be gone. But that's your fault for building those expectations
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.440]   into your children. You can also build the expectations into your children of a simple
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:24.000]   lifestyle, which has the ancillary benefit of being a frugal lifestyle. Now, am I saying that
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.880]   we should abuse our children by not providing for them opportunities? No, but I don't see that it's
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.200]   any benefit to establish these expectations in a child that in order to be happy, they have to
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:40.960]   be part of a consumer culture. I think the exact opposite. I want to be happy with simple life,
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.560]   with simple toys. And so why should I not want the same thing for my child?
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:52.160]   So how do you adjust your financial independence plan to the phases of your life? Well, here's
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.720]   what I say. If you don't have any money, rent a small, cheap apartment, whatever the smallest,
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.480]   cheapest thing is. Maybe you live in a sailboat. You can live on a sailboat as a young married
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.360]   couple and save a ton of money. If you're in England, you can live on a riverboat. If you're
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.760]   in the United States, you can live in a single wide or live in an RV. Do it. It's fun. It's an
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.640]   adventure and it saves you a ton of money. Don't buy a house just because you had a baby. Buy a
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.720]   rental house and stay living on the sailboat. You can have a one-year-old, a two-year-old,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.400]   and a three-year-old in the RV. You can have two or three children in the RV and be totally
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:31.120]   comfortable. So live in the sailboat, live in the RV, and buy a rental house. Then, as you start to
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.600]   have, maybe you have two or three children and your oldest is two, three, four years old, whatever,
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:43.040]   buy a duplex or a quadruplex and live in one small unit. Yes, it's only two bedrooms, one bath,
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.680]   but you can easily put three or four children in one of the bedrooms of a two-bedroom apartment.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:51.600]   The kids, it's fun. It's a lot better for a child to share a room than to think, "Oh, I've got three
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.240]   children. I have to have a five-bedroom house so everyone can have a bed or a bed, its own room."
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.160]   Far better for the children to share rooms. You don't have the same concerns about privacy that
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.080]   you'll have in the future. The children will enjoy it. You don't need the space. Children
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.040]   don't take up that much space. They're kind of small for a long time. So live in one of the
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:15.120]   two-bedroom apartments in your duplex or your quad that you bought and let your tenants pay it off
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:21.680]   and save money. Work hard, build a business, save money. Then as you start to get into the phase of
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:28.400]   life where you need to expand, it's one thing to have a child that's not walking on a sailboat.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.320]   It's another thing to figure out how to engage your seven-year-old. So as you start to need a
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.200]   little space, then if you've put the foundation in place in those early years, go ahead and expand.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:43.120]   Expand to the three-bedroom, two-bath house in the suburbs, but don't make it a 30-year plan or
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.480]   a 40-year plan. Just be smart about it and recognize that at this phase of life, this is
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.040]   what we need and figure out how to get there efficiently. Just because you need a bigger house
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:01.280]   doesn't mean you can't do it for less. There's a reason why people in the country probably on
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.000]   average have larger families than those living downtown. Now, do people in the country have more
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.960]   children or do people with children move to the country? Probably both. But most people with a
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.600]   number of children don't want to live in downtown San Francisco. It's just not conducive to family
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:22.320]   life. The suburbs are a much better fit. That's why those suburbs were built. But now you have
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.120]   children. Does that mean that you have to go and buy the most expensive house? No. Does that mean
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.480]   that you have to live in California? No. You can adjust, and if you have flexibility for your
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.360]   career, figure out how to adjust. Figure out how to adjust things with your family. Think of
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.240]   different strategies. For example, one of the things that I'm grateful for is my parents built
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:48.800]   a house when we were younger. We had outgrown the first house that we lived in that my parents owned.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.280]   We moved out of it. They rented it out, moved into a rental house. The rental house worked for a
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:58.400]   while, but in time, the landlord was ready to sell it and demolish it actually. And so my dad was
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.360]   trying to figure out what do I do. He didn't have the money where he could afford, with my mom being
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.680]   at home, he didn't have the money where he could afford to easily comfortably buy a house, given
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.280]   high housing prices in town. But he did have the money where he was able to buy an acre of land,
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.240]   30 minutes outside of town, out in the, would be a little bit farther out than the suburbs.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.160]   And he had the time freedom, even though he was working a traditional salaried job,
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.320]   he had the ability to do work from home, and so he built a house. And he did a lot of the work
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.720]   himself. Not all of it. Hired a general contractor for some of it, but he did a lot of work himself.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.160]   And he had the benefit of having a bunch of children. I don't know if it adds time to it,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:41.680]   or helps, but he did have a bunch of children. And it was a really unique thing because we spent
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.200]   a couple of years building a house. And I would say on the net, the children were helpful.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:54.320]   We did the roof. Children can easily do roofing. We did not the plumbing, but we did the electrical
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.640]   work. He did the electrical work himself, but children can run wires. It's not that hard when
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.920]   you have some direction. We didn't do the drywall, but we did all the painting. We moved into the
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.640]   house. We didn't have floors. We laid all the floors. Did some of the tile work, laid all the
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.320]   wood floors, et cetera. And so in that period, that had the couple benefits of number one,
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.120]   being able to build a big, huge house. When we moved into the house, there were 10 people living
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.480]   in the house. Six children, two parents, two grandparents, 10 people living in this big,
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:26.960]   huge house, huge house. But we also had the benefit of doing it at a lower cost because
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:32.240]   we did a lot of the work ourselves. And that formed a valuable part of my education and my
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:38.720]   siblings' educations, where for years, many of us used those carpentry skills, used those building
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:45.280]   skills, and used that to generate income because we had far more skills than our peers. So you
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.680]   can't do that with a three-year-old. The three-year-old shouldn't necessarily be out
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.240]   crawling through the rafters, stringing wires, but you can do it with a nine-year-old.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.000]   You can do it with a 12-year-old. And that's about the time in your life where you might need a
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.840]   little bit more space. The three-year-old is not thinking about how nice the house is or how much
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.080]   space there is. They're thinking about their Legos. They're thinking about their dolls.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:15.840]   But as they start to grow, use them and form that as a valuable part of their life and their
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:21.440]   education, et cetera. Now, I don't know what the ideas are that will work in your situation,
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.360]   but you can find them. And everything else that we talk about in good personal financial
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.000]   management and frugality holds constant. Just because you need a bigger car doesn't mean you
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.600]   need to spend a lot of money. The minivan that we have, I paid $3,000 for it years ago. I've driven
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.040]   it, what, 60,000 miles? I think I've had probably $1,000 of repairs, general maintenance. I mean,
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.400]   it's been great. I paid $3,000 for it. It's five-star crash safety test rating, et cetera.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.040]   It's just as safe as a $40,000 minivan. Just because you have children doesn't mean you have
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:02.720]   to go and buy a brand new Honda Odyssey. So don't think that just because I need a bigger car,
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.000]   I automatically have to spend $30,000. You don't. Just because you want to travel and build
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.560]   experiences with your children doesn't mean it has to destroy your family budget. If Disney World
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.800]   will destroy your budget, don't go to Disney World and don't nurture a love of Disney in your
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.160]   children. Parents create this thing. Now, many parents love Disney and they want their children
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.320]   to have the experience of Disney. And so they create it intentionally. They expose their children
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.880]   to the Disney characters and they build this passion for Disney stuff in their children.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.640]   And then it's their greatest achievement as a parent to take their children to Disney. That's
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.720]   fine. You're a parent. You can parent your children how you want. But recognize that you're
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:47.760]   the one building that in your children. You build the connection to Disney, which then builds the
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.600]   $10,000 Disney bill into your life when they're a little bit older. If you want to do it, fine.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:58.400]   But you can also build connections to almost anything else. If you don't want to go to Disney,
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:03.360]   take your children to the national park. Teach them to love hiking. Teach them to love swimming.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:09.120]   Teach them to love snorkeling. Teach them to love kayaking. It's a lot easier and cheaper
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.600]   to teach your children to love snorkeling or kayaking and spend a couple hundred dollars
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:20.160]   on snorkel gear and kayaking gear. And then go to places where you can camp and snorkel and kayak
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.720]   and build rich, rewarding family relationships. Your children will be grinning and having tons
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.840]   of smiles at the end of the day. Just as much, maybe more, I'm biased, but just as much as if
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.400]   you went to Disney World. The choice is yours. What are you going to build in your children?
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.120]   Just because you need more food to feed the hungry mouths doesn't mean you need to spend
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:47.760]   like crazy. There is obviously an increasingly caught increasing marginal cost of food,
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.880]   but you can grow a garden and offset that. It's a very healthy thing for children to be involved in.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.640]   I'm sitting here looking out the window at my garden right now that my children helped me plant.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:03.520]   You can buy your food in bulk. You will have to make a change of restaurants. I don't see any
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.000]   way around that. There's just no way where you can afford to hire servants in a restaurant to feed
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:16.800]   you and five children as cheaply and as afford as rationally as you can if you and your five
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:23.360]   children do the work. That is certainly one where there's a big, big difference and a big change.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.240]   But you can still go to restaurants sometimes and you can still plan ahead at how to do that
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.160]   frugally. And if you make enough money, you can still go to restaurants. But keep your hobbies
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.840]   simple. Do the children all need the super high end stuff? Do you need individual expensive lessons
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.560]   at the most elite place on Saturday morning? Or can the family develop a hobby that builds those
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:49.680]   same skills? Many times we as parents want so much to give our children the best of everything
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:55.200]   that we automatically assume that that means that we have to spend. It doesn't.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:03.680]   If you want to make a happier, more adjusted child, and if you had to pick from these two extremes,
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:10.960]   you don't. Just trying to make a point. You might have parents, they work in high status,
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.720]   high prestige jobs, and they're worried about doing the best thing for their children.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.880]   So they buy all the most expensive schools for their children, all the most elite things.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.360]   They hire the world's most expensive nanny to take care of the children and take them to school back
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.640]   and forth. They hire the world's most expensive housekeeper to have the house in perfect
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.680]   situation. They buy the world's most beautiful house. They buy all the coolest gadgets and the
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:35.840]   coolest things and the best clothes that their child looks totally great. And then they don't
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.080]   see their child because they're busy working all the time. And their child grows up without the
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:46.320]   emotional security of knowing that mom and dad love me. Now you flip that and you could have
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.120]   the poorest family in the world that doesn't have money to go and do anything except play at the
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:56.880]   local park, that doesn't have the time and the money to go out to restaurants. But you have
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:02.160]   parents who pour themselves into their children and the child has the emotional security of knowing
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:11.920]   mom and dad love me. I ask you, which child do you think will be more successful in life?
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:19.920]   The evidence is all around you. Now that doesn't mean that a wealthy parent who wants to put their
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.680]   child in the fancy school and buys all the fanciest things can't also make sure that their
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:32.000]   child knows that they love them. They certainly can. And it doesn't mean that a poor parent can't
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.920]   neglect their child because they're spending so much time worrying about money such that their
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:42.400]   child grows up without foundations. Obviously, the money is not the causal factor. But the money is
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:55.200]   not necessary to build the emotional security into the child. And I would say this. Plan your fund
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:02.960]   around things your family can do with you. And plan your financial independence around your
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:12.800]   children. I believe that the costs of raising children are higher than the costs of not having
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:22.080]   children. I also believe the rewards are incalculably higher. Now, since I have children,
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.960]   I'm biased. And I have a tendency towards confirmation bias. I want to believe that my
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:32.480]   wife and I made the best decision to have children because I have children. That's confirmation bias.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:39.280]   And if you don't want to have children, you're going to want to believe that your life is happier
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.440]   than those who have children. And there's good evidence that you could look at on both those
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.640]   situations. I'm recording this episode, as I said at the beginning, I'm recording this episode
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.800]   while my wife are in one of the most tiring, demanding seasons of our life, where we get to
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.160]   the end of the day, and I don't have a lot of energy left at the end of the day, and neither
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:07.360]   does she. So, I think we're in the thick of it right now. But I still, I look at others, and I
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.720]   walked around me, and to me, I see tremendous joy. My children bring me tremendous joy,
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.920]   tremendous satisfaction. I'm so grateful to be blessed with them. Let me give you some examples
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.360]   from the world of fun. I, over time, I enjoy looking at different YouTube channels, and I
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.320]   watch different people, and I am a student of life. I study what people do, and I try to do my best
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.640]   with the limited information that's presented to try to understand how people think, what they
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.640]   see, and just to watch people. There's a channel that I found years ago on YouTube. So, I'll use
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.760]   YouTube channels. You can look up these channels if you want. Years ago, I found this YouTube
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:47.600]   channel because it was on RVing, and it's called Gone With the Winds, W-Y-N-N-S. The protagonist
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.760]   on the channel are Jason and Nikki Wynn, and for a long time, they lived in an RV, traveled around.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:58.160]   Very good. Jason is an excellent videographer. Just a lovely couple. No children. And so, a couple
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.000]   years ago, they sold their RV, and they bought a sailboat. Currently, they're sailing in the South
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.640]   Pacific. Young, relatively young couple. I don't know how old they are, but young, vibrant couple,
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   beautiful people, very fashionable, very fit, very healthy, very fun. They have winsome
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:20.240]   personalities. Just really lovely, really lovely people. Young couple, no children,
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.800]   sailing the South Pacific. Week after week after week, they produce these sailing videos,
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.280]   and they're so beautifully done. And they bore me because it's just beautiful waves, another sunset,
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.880]   and oh look, we saw this other cool thing. Now, I'm not denying that it's fun, but they're kind
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.600]   of boring. I don't really watch them. I flip to them every now and then. But there's another
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:45.680]   couple. There's another channel that I watch. This channel is called Sailing Zatara, Z-A-T-A-R-A.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   And this couple, or this family, is currently also in the South Pacific, sailing in the South Pacific.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:58.720]   This is Keith and Renee are the parents, but they have four children. Oldest on the boat with them,
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.280]   they have another fifth child that's older, but oldest on the boat with them, I think is about
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.200]   18, 19. Youngest is 11 or 12 at this point in time. Four beautiful children. Now, is it just
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:13.920]   confirmation bias? Maybe. But I find that channel so much more engaging. First, it's an actually,
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.320]   it's a family project. The children all do voiceovers on the video. I think mom's the
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.200]   primary video editor, but the children do all the family voiceovers. And I was recently comparing,
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.080]   both channels had an episode recently where they had some engine trouble. And in the one,
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.240]   in the wins, Jason is down in the engine compartment working all by himself. Where in
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.760]   the other, Keith is in the engine compartment, and he's got his two teenage children helping him,
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:43.680]   working with him, et cetera. The joy, the hijinks, the fun, the fulfillment of Zatara seems to me
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:53.040]   much more fulfilling than the wins. Now, that family with the four children has had years of
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:59.680]   work, but they're sailing the world with their children. They've been on the sailing full time
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   for the last two years. They had to buy a much bigger boat. They've got a five bedroom, five
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.280]   bath catamaran sailboat. Jason and Nikki's boat is smaller. So they had to spend more money to
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.920]   buy a bigger boat. They had to spend more money on just about everything. Ask me to trade places,
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   I'd much rather be Keith than Jason. Much rather be the father of four teenagers and have the joy
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.040]   of showing my children, my teenage children, shaping their lives, the South Pacific,
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:37.200]   diving with them, fishing with them, living with them, schooling with them, teaching them business
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:48.880]   than Jason. Both people are out sailing the South Pacific. Now, I'm sure that Keith,
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:55.120]   the father of four, had to make a whole lot more money than Jason, the part of the couple.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.760]   I don't know anything about them, but Keith was a businessman, sold some businesses.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:06.240]   Keith had to make a lot more money to be able to afford it. I get the impression that Jason and
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:10.480]   Nikki probably primarily depend on their income from their video work to provide for their
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.560]   lifestyle. I'm sure they have savings, of course, but they're not financially independent in the
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:21.520]   same way that I think Keith is, the father is. But there's a richness there. I think Jason and
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:27.600]   Nikki are enjoying themselves. But to me, their lives strike me as a little bit empty. They have
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.920]   two cats they dote on. They have friends. They're having a good time. They seem to be
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:39.040]   really enjoying their trip. At the end of the day, I find it boring compared to the joy of the same
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.560]   exact places, but showing those to the children, helping the children to establish themselves.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.080]   Give you another example. This is another YouTube channel that I like. This YouTube channel is
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.200]   called Epic Family Road Trip. Parents are a Canadian couple. I forget their names. They have
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:01.680]   three teenage children. They started off in an RV, traveled the United States in an RV. Then they
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.520]   moved to a Jeep, traveled around New Zealand for six months in a Jeep with a rooftop tent. They're
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.280]   currently in a Jeep with a rooftop tent and a little trailer with another rooftop tent,
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:15.920]   traveling full time as a family of five with three teenagers, traveling all in the remote areas of
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:22.480]   the United States and Canada. They went out to Mexico as well. But along the way, they're working
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.880]   with their children. They're volunteering with their children. Their children are running the
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:31.440]   YouTube stuff or editing videos, becoming great photographers. They're talking about marketing
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:37.200]   and branding and building brand relationships, etc. And I look at that family, and I don't think
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.280]   they're ultimately financially independent. They don't, of course, say, but being a financial
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.440]   planner, I can pick up on the clues. I think they have enough savings to keep them going for now.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.960]   But after they were on the road for a while, they had to figure out a source of income,
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.960]   and they started to do that together. And the father does speaking and some coaching, etc.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   They're not financially independent, but they're at a phase of their life where they're with their
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.760]   children constantly at that very tender age that children and adolescents go through in their
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.560]   teenage years. And I look at the fun that they're having. The father just celebrated a birthday. I
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:13.040]   can't remember if it was a 50th birthday. The joy of that birthday was tremendous, at least that I
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:20.080]   could see in the video. There's a warmth and a love that comes through. It's palpable. It's tangible.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.800]   And you can see the children learn and grow through their working, through their service,
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.120]   through their fun. I compare that with another YouTube channel that I watch sometimes called
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:36.720]   Technomadia, Chris and Cherie, who are a middle-aged couple. No idea if they're married
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.600]   or not, but they were very clear they didn't want children. They don't have any children,
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.520]   middle-aged couple. They've been living on the road full-time for a number of years. They started
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:48.080]   in a little trailer. Then over time, they built a business. They have a business where they provide
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:54.000]   basically digital tech consulting that helps for nomads, etc. They review how to stay connected
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.560]   on the road. So they do a great job, really, really good, really good job. They live part of
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:03.680]   the year in a bus, an old restored bus that they've restored. They live part of the year in
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.440]   a sailboat. They're doing the Great Loop, not a sailboat, sorry, a powerboat, a large powerboat.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:12.160]   They're doing the Great Loop in the United States. They bought another small RV recently,
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.840]   and they do videos and such. They seem like they're having a nice time.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:21.440]   They get to work together. They get independence. They can come and go as they like.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:31.920]   But man, if I could trade places with one of them, either Chris or the Epic Family Road Trip father,
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.360]   put me on the road with my teenage kids. Even if it's only a few years and we can't do it forever,
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:45.200]   just to me, there seems like there's a joy of life that Chris and Cherie don't get access to.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:53.120]   I don't think that children have to keep you from having fun. A couple other ones, big families.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:57.840]   There's a family, has a YouTube channel, I think a website, called the Kellogg family. They have
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.200]   12 children. They live in, lived, currently live sort of, well, I don't know if they live in an
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:08.160]   RV right now. I think they're in Europe, but they have lived in an RV. Have lived in an RV. Their
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:14.880]   kids love kayaking. That's their thing. And they have this beat up old redneck looking RV that they
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:19.840]   lived in with, I think, their younger 10 children. And they're out kayaking. It's absolute bedlam.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:26.640]   But there's also just a joy and a liveliness to their lives. Now they're in Europe traveling all
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:32.000]   over. Don't tell me it can't be done. They got 12 children. Can't discern that they have a lot
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.560]   of money. I think that as a programmer, again, kind of a redneck looking RV, but you go back
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.960]   and you watch those videos and is it bedlam? Absolutely. Is it hugely stressful? I'm sure it
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:50.720]   is. Is it fun? The kids are having a ball. The parents are having fun. There's another channel,
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.520]   Norpin South, nine children, I think five adopted, four biological, something like that. Nine
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:00.160]   children, traveled in an RV, traveled around Europe, et cetera. Are they financially independent
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:07.360]   living on savings? Nope. Their income. But there's a sense of joy in the life. There's a sense of
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.120]   liveliness. Just because you have children and it costs you a lot of money doesn't mean that you
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:16.240]   automatically can't do anything fun. I was like Greg Denny's work. He's been on the show in the
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:24.080]   past, world schooling family. Six children, travel the world, working on the road. There
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.440]   were lots and lots of inspirational, none of those YouTube channels that I mentioned are necessarily
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.440]   financially independent, although they range. Probably the most financially independent would
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.280]   be the sailing family, sailing Zatarra, ranging down to the Kellogg show. They're not financially
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:42.480]   independent. I would guess not. They don't have a lot of money. They're just making it work,
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.200]   living and working on the road. But you could find inspirational stories of families who've
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:53.200]   become financially independent. Amy Decision, founder of the Tightwad Gazette. I think she and
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.520]   her husband had either five or six children. I forget now. He retired from the Navy, had a small
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:03.040]   Navy pension. Then she built the newsletter business, Tightwad Gazette. He became Mr. Dad,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:08.320]   did all the dad things while she built the business. But because of their hardcore frugality,
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.280]   they were able to raise their children, healthy, successful children, but also become financially
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.320]   independent. She retired from public life. I tried to get her on the show, talked to her on
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.320]   the phone for a while. She wouldn't come on. She didn't want to. She didn't see the reason to it.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.600]   There are other people too. Charles Long wrote the book How to Survive Without a Salary.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.840]   He told such fun and interesting stories about his
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:33.600]   conserver lifestyle, but also doing it with children, traveled the world with his children.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.680]   I compare him to, I think, Ernie Zelinsky. There's a difference in writing. I don't know if Ernie has
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.480]   kids or not, but you read it and the point is that there are lots of people who can become
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.240]   financially independent with children and without children. And yet, with children,
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:54.640]   I think children can be a source of tremendous joy and satisfaction. I don't believe that children
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.600]   necessarily solve anything in life. They don't make it easier to become financially independent.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:06.400]   Children are tough. A lot of work. A lot, a lot of work. They can tire you out. They can wear you
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:13.440]   out. I have nowhere near the amount of energy, creativity, time to work that I once had. I wish
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.720]   I had been more productive before I had children. But I don't think that children doom you to a life
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:28.320]   of poverty, either financially or emotionally. On the contrary, I think it's very possible
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.320]   to build great financial abundance and to enjoy the joy that comes with people.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:38.560]   Yes, your life will be different. I have no interest in forcing anyone to have children.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:45.040]   That's a very personal decision. I don't think it's anybody's business but you and your spouse.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:52.320]   But if you choose to have children, or you want to have children,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.240]   I don't believe that you should think that means that you can't be financially independent.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:06.080]   It doesn't. When you start to think about the phases of life, recognize that children are in
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:12.240]   your life for a relatively short period of time. Probably about 20 years per child,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.560]   depending on how many years you're having babies. That 20 years, if you have babies for 10 years,
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:23.040]   maybe it's 30 years that you're planning on. But in reality, those years are not all the same.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.880]   And financially, they don't have to look like the standard American or Australian model.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.760]   As I've talked about, babies have certain needs, young children have certain needs,
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.880]   teenagers have certain needs, and then they're gone.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.640]   And then your life changes again. So you might require a more creative approach.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.360]   You might not be able to come, maybe if you didn't have children from 20 to 25, you could
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.040]   become financially independent. But if you have three children for 20 to 25,
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:57.040]   your financial independence plans change. But don't think that having children means
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:04.160]   you can't become financially independent. I believe that parents with children can become
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.400]   financially independent. But those people who choose not to have children may become...
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:17.600]   Parents with children can become financially independent, and they'll have the joys and the
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.240]   fun of financial independence, and they'll also have the experience of having children.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:28.880]   Whereas those people who choose not to have children may become financially independent
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:34.960]   and experience the fun and the joy of that process. But they will never experience
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:44.720]   the joy and the trials of having children. Which one is better? I'm biased. I don't know how to
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:51.600]   differentiate between my confirmation bias to want to tell myself I did the right thing,
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.000]   I had the right solution. There have been many times I have thought, "This would be a lot easier
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.080]   if I didn't have children." I don't know how I'll ever be able to Jeep around the world.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.720]   I can't fit my family into a Jeep. I've thought about, "Okay, I'll build a six-door Jeep. I'll
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.480]   need $100,000." I don't know how I'll do those things. But where I'm at today, in the thick of
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.920]   it, if I were making the same decision, if I had the decision to make over again,
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:22.800]   I wouldn't change a thing about having children. I'd change a few things of how hard I worked
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:26.560]   before I had children. I'd change a few things about my financial productivity before having
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:34.000]   children. I will not deny that I do experience a bit of envy of those parents who were able to
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.320]   capture the vision of FI and build financial independence before they have children.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.840]   I don't know how, I don't think there's a parent out there that wouldn't say, "It doesn't seem like
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:47.920]   it'd be easier if I didn't have to simultaneously be financially productive and care for young
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.800]   children." But I can't change that. All I can do is try to help other people do differently,
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.960]   but I can't change that for myself. But I wouldn't change it. So you have to make your
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.080]   own decisions. Hope this was helpful to you. Hope it was a little bit inspiring to you.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.880]   Thank you for listening to today's show. I'll record separately a kind of conversation on the
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:12.720]   future of the show. I am excited about things. The last, I'll tell you, I mean, you've noticed
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.720]   there can be some heavy costs to having children. Last month's have been very difficult.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.800]   We had a sick baby, a colicky baby for three months. Man, that makes it hard to work.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:30.560]   It's just a tremendous burden on your wife, on you. It's really, really challenging. And it does
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.480]   make things less productive. And I thank you for sticking with me through the difficult times.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:40.000]   At the moment though, we're in a good work phase and I've got a lot of plans and I've got a lot of
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.560]   clarity on the future of Radical Personal Finance, which I will share with you in the future.
