[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.520]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 201.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:15.380]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.320]   Jesse, did you notice when you came in,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.480]   I emptied the garbage before you got here?
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.940]   - I did notice that, it's been full for months.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.320]   I probably should have taken it out,
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.800]   but I didn't, it got too much.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.240]   - Let me say this. - I didn't know where it was.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.420]   - Let me say this, I don't use the word hero lightly,
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.020]   but in this case, without reservation,
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.520]   I think I can describe myself that way.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.920]   I was quite proud of myself.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.700]   Two updates that I think, one in particular,
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.220]   our audience is gonna care a lot about
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.960]   based on email volume.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.060]   Yesterday, Jesse, was the big day at my house.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.320]   The new upstairs air conditioner, installed.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.560]   - How is it?
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.680]   - We're testing it out.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.720]   It's gonna take a couple of days to feel it out.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.200]   - It's not like unbelievable?
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.540]   - Well, here's the issue.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.560]   The first day you get a new AC installed,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.860]   that whole day, you have no air conditioner on.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.840]   So your house gets up,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840]   my house got up to 85 degrees up there.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.640]   So it takes it all evening to kind of catch up
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640]   and get rid of, they called it the heat mass,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.920]   that's the technical term.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.280]   So by night, it was cold up there, it did catch up.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.480]   But today's the first normal day.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.400]   I set it before I left.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.680]   So it'll be interesting to see when we get back.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.620]   But there's a parable.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.840]   So there's a parable for the stuff we talk about here
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.040]   in the AC installation,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.160]   because these new ACs are,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.240]   especially like we bought a fancy one
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.280]   for no real good reason,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.240]   but they're complicated, right?
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.720]   They're more advanced than they used to be.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.800]   My old AC we replaced was 20 years old.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.360]   I believe if you opened up that AC to look inside,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.140]   there was a pigeon and a thermometer.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.840]   And then if the thermometer got too high,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.400]   it would pull a string with its beak.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.360]   And this new AC has roughly speaking
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   the supercomputer HAL from 2001, trying to control it.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   So the technology has gotten really advanced.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.400]   I don't know what all those chips do.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.000]   There's three different computer chips in these things.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.480]   I believe if I'm reading the manual correctly,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.760]   in addition to automatically adjusting
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   the stage of the compressor,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.260]   this AC unit can also make novel policy prescriptions
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.760]   to fight climate change.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400]   It's all built into the circuitry.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.720]   But here's the thing.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.540]   It's wired out of the factory
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.440]   for this incredibly complex control panel.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.800]   It's a control panel that is the size of an iPad Pro,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400]   like a really big screen,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.040]   like full of all these fancy interfaces.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680]   It's $1,200.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.480]   And I told my guys, I was like, I don't want that.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.840]   I don't want a computerized cockpit to control my AC.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080]   I was like, I want my old thermostat.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   It tells me what the temperature is,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.360]   what it's supposed to be, like what it's set to.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.520]   And it has an up arrow and a down arrow.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   Like, I want that.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.720]   And so like, okay, we'll make that work for you.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.560]   They had to be on the phone with technical support,
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.600]   a carrier for probably an hour
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.800]   to figure out basically how to retrograde back the AC
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.440]   so that we could just control it old style analog.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.840]   Because the wires that are wired up by default
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.080]   to go to the thermostat are like digital control wires.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   So you can strap on your virtual reality helmet
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.660]   and drag your temperature gauges through the landscape
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.880]   that carrier created of the metaverse or whatever.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.120]   And I wanted up and down arrows,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.960]   which just requires these low voltage wires
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.120]   that aren't digital, just turn on, turn off,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.960]   turn on, turn off.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.000]   So they had to rewire this thing.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.440]   I mean, they were in there like connecting wires,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.280]   but we did it.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.520]   So I think that's a case study
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.840]   of digital minimalism in action.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   I rejected a $1,200 computerized cockpit
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.800]   for my air conditioner.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.040]   And we successfully got a 20 year old
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.920]   up arrow, down arrow thermostat.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.600]   - So when you go home today, it should be golden, right?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.780]   - I hope so.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.960]   Yeah, yeah, I've got it set somewhere cool.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.640]   Tomorrow's going to be hot.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.800]   So that'll be the real test.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.820]   There's all sorts of variables.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.660]   I don't want to get into it,
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.920]   but it's hard to get the Freon just right
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.840]   when you first install it,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.920]   you actually have to run it for a day or two
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.480]   to get it fully circulated so you don't overcharge it.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.440]   So like they might have to come back.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.120]   I may have had a probe thermometer up there earlier today
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.740]   to make sure that the delta interval
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.480]   on the air coming out versus the air in the room
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.340]   was at the acceptable level and it was.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.560]   So I was up there getting some numbers.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.040]   - So does reading the manual count as a June book?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   - I didn't actually read the manual,
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.620]   but yeah, it probably should.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.940]   - You read the whole thing or look out?
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.140]   - If I read the whole thing, yeah, I read the whole thing.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.220]   The other thing going on at the homestead is the library.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.540]   The long awaited library and building in my house
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.540]   to be my writing location is being installed
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.700]   starting yesterday and today.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.600]   They're putting in all these,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.340]   we got these custom built-in bookcases.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.680]   We're making an over the top room.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.520]   We'll bring you out there,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.700]   we'll film the video once it's done.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.540]   - Nice.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.240]   - But it's kind of over the top.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.480]   It's blue and walnut.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.100]   So it's like a custom built blue,
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.060]   the whole room is like blue bookcases,
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.720]   but with walnut surfaces
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.680]   and the whole room is surrounded in it
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.240]   and it's gonna have my custom desk.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.340]   And you know, I'm a big believer, location matters.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.300]   Like functionality matters for an office.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.440]   People always care about functionality.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   Like, do I have my printer?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.920]   Do I have the right monitor?
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.480]   You know, is my phone in here? Is the wifi good?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.440]   We never think about aesthetics, right?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.660]   What is the aesthetics of the room?
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.560]   What is the cognitive impact of the aesthetics?
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.760]   I think it makes a big difference.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.600]   So I'm, you know, putting my money where my mouth is
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   and building this.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.260]   - When's the desk come?
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.880]   - It's shipping in the first week of July.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.240]   So two weeks, ships in two weeks.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080]   It's cool.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   We got these painting, like at the top of the shelves,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   these brass lamps, like painting lamps, you know,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.640]   like paint the like long, like skinny brass things
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   that stick out and shine down on the shelves.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.320]   We put, I installed the gas line into our fireplace.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.740]   So in the winter, I can have crackling flames,
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.240]   like while I'm writing, I figure if I'm gonna be,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.920]   I'm writing a lot these days, books, New Yorker, et cetera.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.160]   I figure if I'm gonna be writing this much,
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.000]   let's lean in and actually try to get the right environment.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.920]   So I'm excited about that.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.200]   - So the books in the HQ are going bye-bye?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.040]   - They're going bye-bye.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.800]   Yeah, we got to rethink,
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.440]   we got a lot of redecoration to do, Jesse.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.160]   Like we gotta, I think we need to reconceive the HQ.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.000]   We never actually--
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.240]   - Well, the fact that we took out the trash,
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.200]   I mean, it's a big step.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.160]   - I think that's like 50% of the battle
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.000]   was emptying the trash.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.720]   And then the other 50% is actually bringing in furniture.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.960]   So we get the trash out, number one.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.720]   Number two, we actually have to figure out
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.760]   what we want to do with this place.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.880]   I think we can make it cool.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.320]   I mean, this is our only room that I would say is
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.760]   where we want it to be, is the studio.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.720]   But I don't know what to do in that main room.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.920]   I want to do something cool.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.760]   We'll think it through.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.960]   - When the books go, we got to do something
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.840]   'cause it's going to be bare.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.680]   - Yeah, we can't have it empty.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.720]   I mean, I'll keep it.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.760]   - Put a pull-up bar in there.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.600]   - Put a pull-up bar in there.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   Doesn't Joe Rogan's broadcasting warehouse have--
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.440]   - It has a gym.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.280]   - It has like a full gym, right?
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.400]   - Yeah.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.080]   When you get on a show, you should lift there.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.760]   - Yeah, and come in all sweaty.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.440]   - Yeah, I'm sure he has showers.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   - Yeah, I bet he does.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.560]   He has a, I heard he has a sensory deprivation tank.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.400]   - Probably.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.240]   - At the thing.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.760]   - Is that like the heat thing?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.560]   - It's salt water so that you float on it.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   - The exact temperature of your body.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.800]   So like, and it's dark.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.640]   So it kind of freaks you out.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.480]   - I think they got a good little routine.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.400]   They like record, work out.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.000]   Some of the guests probably go to the gym.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.640]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.840]   So we're building a gym.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.160]   I'll tell Zoe.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.320]   I'm sure the floors and stuff in here
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.100]   can easily handle gym equipment.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.640]   All right, well, anyways, we got a good show today.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.560]   Good questions.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.400]   We got written questions.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.480]   We got calls.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.520]   Later on, I have a new segment I wanna try
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.880]   where I go through a couple of cool things
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.280]   people sent me to the interesting@calnewport.com address.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.560]   But I thought I would start today's episode
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.680]   reacting to my own article.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.520]   So the day before we're recording this episode,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.040]   I published my latest for "The New Yorker."
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.000]   It was a bit of a longer piece
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.200]   than I've been writing recently.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.680]   It was more of a 5,000 word, more of an epic piece.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.840]   And the title is
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   "The Rise of the Internet's Creative Middle Class."
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.160]   And I thought I would go through
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.600]   just the big ideas from this article.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.400]   And then I have a couple of follow-up points
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.080]   about some follow-up points, not in the article,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.720]   but based on reactions I've gotten to the article
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.240]   since it's come out.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.920]   So if you're watching this, instead of listening to this,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.380]   I also have the article loaded up here on the HQ tablet.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.240]   So you can actually see the words I'm talking about.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.200]   If you're just listening though, I'll read what I'm saying.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.600]   So you'll be able to follow along.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.080]   All right.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.200]   So I just wanna give you the main bullet points.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   This is 5,000 words.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.960]   There's a lot of details.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.880]   But the article opened with me
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.640]   going to the studio of "Breaking Points."
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.560]   So "Breaking Points" is a internet news show.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.600]   It's hosted by Sagar and Jetty and Crystal Ball.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.280]   So they both come from journalism backgrounds.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.760]   Sagar from the right, Crystal from the left.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.840]   So Sagar used to be the White House correspondent
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.160]   for "The Daily Caller."
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.080]   Crystal was a host of a show on MSNBC.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.320]   Years ago, they came together
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.200]   to do a show together called "Rising."
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.000]   It was filmed at The Hill,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.680]   the publication The Hill here in DC.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.920]   And the whole idea was someone from the left,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.440]   someone from the right talking about the news.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.560]   And then they went independent.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.960]   So a couple of years ago, they went independent
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.240]   and said, "We can do this ourselves."
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.320]   And so I went to their studio.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.360]   They leased some studio space downtown here in downtown DC.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.960]   They have a cool set, $60,000 camera system
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.960]   that films at a really high resolution
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.160]   so that you can stream this onto big screen TVs.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.840]   And it looks really nice.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.880]   Real control room with actual, you know,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.920]   upper middle-age engineer control room type men in there
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.280]   working TriCasters and the sound.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.720]   And it was a real professional operation.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.040]   They do a news show.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.160]   It's on the internet.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.840]   If you subscribe, you get it on YouTube.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.280]   There's a podcast version.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.600]   They put clips of it on YouTube for free.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.560]   So I went to visit this and visit them.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.920]   If the names sound familiar,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.360]   it's they've gotten a lot of exposure through Joe Rogan.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.440]   So he likes them because they come at news
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.520]   from the left and the right.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.280]   And so they end up in kind of independent territory
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.040]   as opposed to just trying to work backwards
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:50.880]   from what's our point.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.760]   So they're on that show a lot.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.720]   I think that's, that helped them grow,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.440]   but they had a history from before then.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.520]   And I've been on, I was on "Rising"
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.240]   to talk about one of my books before they went independent.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.480]   I've been on "Soggers" podcast.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.440]   So I've crossed paths with them before.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.200]   All right, so you look at that show
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.900]   and you see that it's doing well.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.960]   It's doing well.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.980]   It does not require nearly the overhead
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.480]   of their old traditional TV shows.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.080]   They have only eight hourly contractors
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.120]   and yet their viewership metrics
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.920]   are already outpacing their former show.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.880]   So they have more views.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.160]   If you look on YouTube, if you look at podcast downloads,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.600]   whatever metrics you want to look at,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.080]   they're doing better than the old traditionally
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.360]   produced TV show at a fraction of the cost.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.840]   So my point as early in this article is that's interesting.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.280]   And maybe there's a lesson to be learned there
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.420]   about the evolution of news.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.800]   But the reason why I was focusing on breaking points,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.360]   the reason why I wanted to introduce them
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.080]   to the readers of this article
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.800]   is that I think they show a more important trend.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.960]   And here's my exact words from the article,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.720]   one in which a dismissed prophecy
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.160]   about the potential of the internet to support creative work
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.980]   might be making a triumphant return.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.960]   So they are my piece of evidence
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.120]   that a once dismissed prophecy about the internet
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.960]   might be finally coming true.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.200]   All right, so what is that prophecy?
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.280]   Well, we got to go all the way back to 2008.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.440]   Remember 2008 was a very different time
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.120]   than the web is today.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.240]   This was at the beginning of the web 2.0 revolution.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.140]   So this was the beginning of that idea
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   that you as a consumer could contribute content to the web
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.040]   as opposed to just going to websites and consuming content.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.320]   We're used to that now, but it was a big deal back then.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.240]   So it was in 2008 when web 2.0 was first becoming a thing
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.080]   that Kevin Kelly, the former executive editor of Wired,
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.040]   actually the founding executive editor of Wired
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.720]   and general techno optimist.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.120]   So someone who provided a nice blurb
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.520]   for so good they can't ignore you.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.240]   He had a nice blurb for a world without email.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.440]   So I've crossed paths with Kevin Kelly over the years.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.920]   He wrote a very internet important, I would say,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   essay called "A Thousand True Fans."
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.720]   This is gonna be the prophecy that this article is about.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.400]   So the basic idea with "A Thousand True Fans"
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.840]   is Kevin Kelly was saying,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.960]   now that the internet is here,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.120]   now that the internet is interactive,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.220]   now that you can produce and post content
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.920]   as easily as you can consume it,
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   this is gonna be a boon for creative professionals.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.600]   Because now as a creative professional,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.960]   you can not only post your stuff online,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.000]   you can interact with people online.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.700]   You have at your fingertips,
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.680]   this whole vast audience of the entire world's population.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.700]   And all you have to do,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.560]   and this was his "A Thousand True Fans" concept,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.040]   all you had to do is find a,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.460]   and cultivate a small but loyal fan base
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.400]   of all the millions and millions of internet users.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.320]   If you can find, and this was his math,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.060]   a thousand loyal supporters,
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.160]   each of whom is willing to spend $100 a year
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.440]   on you and your art,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.940]   you're now making a good middle-class living
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.940]   doing creative work.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.920]   Now this was a really big deal essay.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.080]   It was really influential because the idea was,
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.340]   pre-internet, if you were a creative type,
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.160]   you only had access to the people
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.600]   who were proximate to you,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.860]   the people who live near you,
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.760]   the people who lived in your town,
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.960]   unless you were one of the vanishingly small few
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.360]   who had access to national,
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.080]   international broadcast platforms
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.400]   like television or newspapers.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.060]   But there was such a small number of people
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.240]   who could be in the movies or be on TV
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.580]   or be in the newspaper,
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.580]   that almost everyone else who wanted to do creative work,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.000]   you only had access to people who happened to be nearby.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.520]   And it was probably going to be difficult
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.980]   for you to find enough real fans
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.480]   who lived within 50 miles of you to actually make a living.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.720]   And Kelly's point is the internet changes that
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.560]   because now you can assemble these thousand true fans
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.680]   from anywhere around the world and make a living off of it.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.400]   So now you've unlocked the economic potential
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.240]   for lots of different creative types
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.960]   to actually make a living doing creative work.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.680]   As I argued, this essay hit right as the economic crisis
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.560]   of 2008 was picking up steam,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.120]   so it was really aspirational.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.480]   People's savings were going away,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.200]   their retirement accounts were disappearing,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.380]   their jobs were, either they were losing them
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.960]   or they're having the screws turned to them,
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.280]   working longer for less money
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.360]   'cause everyone was faltering.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   And this idea of, hey, with this new technology,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.560]   forget this diminishing rat race.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.120]   You can make a living, support your family
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.720]   doing creative work, very aspirational.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.740]   This essay became very popular.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.040]   Here's the part that most people didn't know about.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.320]   If you go back and look at the reception of this essay,
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.440]   yes, it became very popular,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.920]   but almost immediately there was pushback.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.880]   And one of the strongest sources of pushback
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.220]   came from Jaron Lanier,
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.200]   whose work I talk about a lot on the show.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.800]   Jaron knew Kevin Kelly.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   They've known each other since the '80s.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.520]   When Kevin first met Jaron to interview him
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.080]   about his pioneering work on virtual reality,
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.880]   they were both techno-optimists from the West Coast scene.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.100]   Jaron Lanier in particular
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.600]   was a really big open culture advocate.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.000]   Software should be free, bits should be free,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.960]   the internet's gonna create this sort of utopian world.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.200]   What had happened to Jaron, though,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.000]   we've talked about this before on the show,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.280]   is he took a hard turn towards skepticism.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.680]   He eventually went back
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.120]   and renounced his techno-optimist views
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.360]   and said the internet is not going the way I hoped
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.380]   and the internet is beginning to bifurcate
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.740]   the haves and the haves not,
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.200]   and all the value generated is ossifying
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   at a very small number of companies
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.800]   and a very small number of individuals
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.000]   that have a lot of stock in those companies.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So he had had this turn towards skepticism around this point
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.360]   and he looked to Kevin Kelly's "A Thousand True Fans" essay
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.840]   and almost immediately came back and said,
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.040]   "Kevin, this makes sense on paper,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.940]   "but if it was true,
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.900]   "we should see more people doing this successfully."
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.260]   So where are all of these artists and musicians
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.920]   that have a thousand true fans
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.360]   that they have cultivated online,
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.440]   making a middle-class living?
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.400]   The web has been around now for a while.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.880]   Technologically, this has been possible for a while.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.960]   Where are they?
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.440]   And this is a little known chapter in this history,
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.880]   but Kevin actually posted a follow-up essay,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.220]   it's pretty soon after,
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:26.040]   and he explained Jarren's hesitancy.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.680]   And he said, "Okay, let's prove Jarren wrong."
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.700]   Now, in fact, I have the exact wording here in the article.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.120]   He said, "Okay, to prove Jarren wrong,"
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   this is Kevin Kelly writing to his audience,
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.580]   "Simply submit a candidate in the comments.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.920]   "A musician with no ties to old media models
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.040]   "now make it 100% of their living
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.920]   "in the open media environment."
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.580]   So Jarren complained, Kevin said,
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.700]   "No, no, I'm sure artists and creative types
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.480]   "living on this model exist and let's find them."
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.760]   He challenged his readers
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.040]   and they couldn't find anybody.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   The way Jarren summarized it later in his book,
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.880]   "You Are Not a Gadget,"
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.200]   which you should read if you have not,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.440]   very influential book for techno criticism circles.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.440]   They identified a handful at most of artists
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.360]   who satisfy that theory.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.180]   And if you really go down the rabbit hole on this
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.320]   and look at the artists they found,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.640]   it was kind of questionable whether they qualified or not.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.440]   Like they basically couldn't find anyone.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   And by the time Jarren published "You Are Not a Gadget,"
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.120]   it's a chapter about a thousand true fans in that manifesto
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.480]   where he's like, "This just didn't work."
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.360]   A thousand true fans was hopeful,
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.880]   but it wasn't actually something
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.700]   that we saw come to fruition.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.500]   And so for people who studied the internet,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.160]   it was sort of this sad case study of optimism
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.380]   that soon bled away.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.440]   So what actually happened here?
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.480]   Well, I think Jarren Lanier has a really good argument
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.160]   that it was the structure,
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.920]   the evolving structure of the web itself
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.280]   that scuttled the feasibility of the thousand true fans.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.360]   And in particular, the hijacking of web 2.0
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.200]   by a small number of large social media platform monopolies
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.960]   like Facebook and then later Instagram and Twitter.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.880]   And the way Jarren tells us,
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   I think it's a really important critique,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.440]   is that Google ads came along earlier in the 2000s
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.880]   and they showed that embedded ads could make money.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.960]   So in other words, putting ads on content
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.120]   that normal individuals made.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.440]   So here's my website, here is calnewport.com
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.680]   and I'm doing Google AdSense
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.200]   and it will automatically put ads
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.220]   onto the content I generated.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.040]   This made a lot of money for Google.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.640]   It became basically a money minting machine.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.520]   And there was this aha light that went on
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.840]   in the techno circles out in Silicon Valley,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.480]   which is web 2.0 means lots of people
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.260]   are creating a lot of content.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.220]   All of that content can be essentially the fertilizer
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.040]   for our advertising money trees.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.960]   So social media came along and even though
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.280]   it originally pushed itself as being about connection
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.160]   and relationships and making it easier
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.200]   to express yourself and connect to others,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.080]   that was not the pitch being made to investors.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.960]   The pitch being made to investors is
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   all of these millions of people
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.520]   are gonna be generating content.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.440]   If we can get that content generated on our servers,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.000]   on our platforms, we get all the money
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.760]   from all the ads we can place on it.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.120]   And so a small number of companies
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.220]   basically hijacked the web 2.0 revolution.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.040]   It said, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.080]   you should express yourself on the web,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.440]   but you do it in our walled garden.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   We can control it.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.680]   And that became as Jaren explains it,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.560]   the downfall of the thousand true fans model,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.440]   because once these companies were making
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.680]   hundreds of billions of dollars evaluation
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.880]   appear out of nowhere, just off of the back
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.240]   of this digital sharecropping that was occurring
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.480]   out there in this hijacked world of web 2.0,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.960]   they began pushing their technology platforms
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.040]   to optimize the money this made.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.200]   And this eventually led to these streaming style models.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.160]   Twitter led the way,
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.360]   but then Facebook and Instagram followed.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.760]   These models where you were no longer even going
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.160]   to social media homepages of individuals.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.040]   You were no longer posting on the wall
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.640]   of your friend on Facebook.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   Algorithms would just pull interesting information
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.040]   off of the platform and put it
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.120]   into an infinite scroll stream.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.060]   And you as a consumer would just keep scrolling
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.720]   through this, everything you were seeing
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.160]   was designed to hit your fancy,
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.000]   to give you distraction in the moment,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.040]   to give you those little chemical bursts.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.920]   In that setting, the thousand true fans
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   was not going to survive.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.420]   And here's the words I wrote,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.400]   this relentless pace rewards passive consumption,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.080]   not active interaction with individual creators.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.640]   So here's why.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.660]   As a creator, you can submit your creations
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.880]   into the stream, but once there,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.440]   they will be chopped up and commoditized.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.520]   If you're lucky, perhaps something you post
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.580]   will temporarily spark a surge of engagement,
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.940]   but the same spectators exhausted by the onslaught
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.360]   will soon shift their weary attentions
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.320]   to the next recommended item following close behind.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.720]   So this is what happened when web 2.0 got hijacked.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.760]   All of this user created content got chopped up
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.640]   and commoditized and put into an algorithmically
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.760]   optimized stream where it was dehumanized,
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.360]   barely connected to the individuals who created it.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.720]   And we sit there and watch this just stream past.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.420]   That was not an environment well-suited
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.900]   for many different individual idiosyncratic creators
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.800]   to foster and create communities,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.120]   small but loyal communities based around their work
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.100]   that they could then monetize and make a living off of it.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.880]   So that was why, at least in Jaren Linares telling,
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   that is why the dream of a thousand true fans fell apart.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.760]   But then we go back to breaking points.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.040]   And what I wrote here is perhaps we were too quick
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.240]   to dismiss Kelly's a thousand true fans theory.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.800]   It faltered in 2008, but 14 years later,
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.000]   it might be making a comeback.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.680]   Because you look at something like breaking points
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.940]   and what you see is actually something very much
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.600]   like Kelly's original model in action.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.780]   Sager and Crystal are not 20 million follower
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.500]   Instagram influencers.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.260]   They're not one of these YouTube Mr. Beast style superstars.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.940]   They gets 26 million views on every video they put up.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.740]   They have roughly 10,000 subscribers.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.300]   So yes, it's a factor of 10 larger
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.440]   than Kelly's original prediction,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.860]   but within that same ballpark, 10,000 subscribers.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.500]   So a small number by any of those large
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.980]   follower account type scales, 10,000 subscribers
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.980]   who pay them money because they respect what they're doing.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.420]   They like the style of independent news
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.500]   that Crystal and Sager produce.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.040]   Off of those 10,000 subscribers,
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.780]   they are able to produce the show.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.500]   And they pay themselves, I talked to them about it,
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.080]   salaries that are more or less in line
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.260]   with what they were making when they were hosting the show
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.700]   at the Hill, right?
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.460]   So they're not trying to become immensely wealthy.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.420]   They can cover their budget.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.980]   They can cover the studio they lease.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.700]   And those are hourly contractors
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.660]   that help work their equipment,
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.740]   the eight hourly contractors that helps pay for their time.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.660]   And it works out.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.620]   And when I pushed them, I was like,
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.240]   look, you guys wanna go the route of the ringer
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.860]   or of Gimlet, you wanna take on venture capital money
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.740]   and build up a huge staff and grow a large network
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.780]   that you can then sell for $200 million down the line.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.760]   They had zero interest in that.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.140]   Crystal was really clear.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.920]   She wanted to get away from bureaucracy and giant offices
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.880]   and having to deal with staff.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.080]   They just wanted to produce their show.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.920]   They wanna do news.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.320]   They wanna be able to do it full-time.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   It's Kevin Kelly's "1,000 True Fans" come to fruition.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.720]   When I go in the article and give a lot of examples,
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.600]   like we can actually find a lot of examples of this now
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   of people who have modest size audiences of strong fans
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.460]   who pay them money for the content or whatever they produce
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.760]   allowing them to make a good living, not to become rich,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   but can make a good living.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.540]   Again, that's the Kevin Kelly dream.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.460]   I gave two reasons for this.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.940]   Number one, I think the rise of online news paywalls
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.640]   and subscription video streaming services like Netflix
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.280]   got us used to the idea of paying all a cart
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.760]   for digital content.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   When Kevin Kelly wrote his original essay,
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.320]   that was a time where people thought
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   no one's ever gonna pay money for digital content online.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.560]   Everything has to be free.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.120]   Everything has to be ad supported.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.160]   Now we're used to it.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.920]   We pay newyorker.com.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.760]   We pay Netflix.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.840]   We pay Hulu.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.640]   We're kind of used to paying all a cart
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.720]   for digital content.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.200]   So once we're used to that,
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.520]   when someone like Sager and Crystal comes along,
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.720]   we're like, yeah, it's just another thing.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.120]   I pay a little bit of money for it.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   I pay a little bit of money for to get digital content.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.220]   The other thing to change was attitudes towards social media.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.840]   So there was a time, and I know this
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.680]   'cause I used to get roasted,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.800]   where social media was where all the energy is.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.900]   So the idea that you would leave social media
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.000]   and interact with creators directly over the internet
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.720]   without using the intermediation of social media
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.360]   would have been considered risky or weird.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.240]   Now, for all the reasons we talked about on the show,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.400]   there's a lot of pushback and skepticism
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.640]   and distrust about social media.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.520]   So this idea that I'm gonna subscribe to breaking points
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.920]   using a small app like Supercast,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.520]   and they have MailChimp is gonna email me direct link URLs,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.480]   their unlisted videos,
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.440]   a whole ecosystem I'm using to interact with them
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.720]   that has nothing to do with social media.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.440]   Now we're used to that.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.040]   We're excited to do that.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.160]   So we needed those two innovations,
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.360]   getting used to paying for digital content,
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.640]   and two, being comfortable leaving the walled gardens,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.520]   the heavily controlled walled gardens of social media
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.280]   and interacting with creators through other internet tools.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.840]   Those two things have come together.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.160]   And I think we see this revolution of the return of people
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.940]   potentially being able to make a living online.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.480]   One of the other big examples I give is podcasting.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.000]   Right, I mean, what is a successful podcast,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   if not a perfect demonstration
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.160]   of Kevin Kelly's theory in action?
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.360]   You have this audience of dedicated fans
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.120]   who are willing to stream hours
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.200]   of your audio content each week.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.920]   From an advertiser perspective, that is really valuable.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.800]   And you can monetize that.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.480]   And with a modest, but really strong audience,
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.840]   you can make a creative living with a podcast.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.640]   I worked out the numbers for this article.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.060]   I mean, depending on the type of content, et cetera, et cetera
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.280]   something like 30,000 downloads a week.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.360]   So if you had 30,000 dedicated fans
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.840]   who had listened to one episode of your show per week
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.880]   and with the right number of ads, if you do the math,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.700]   somewhere in there,
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.760]   you'd get to Kevin Kelly's $100,000 a year.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   So again, this is all within the ballpark
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.680]   of his original number, but this is the optimism here.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.380]   We are returning to a place where it's possible
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.440]   for a larger, more diverse group of creative types
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.520]   doing a more diverse array of creative activities
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.600]   like Sager and Crystal,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.320]   like a bunch of podcasters out there
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.980]   to actually really make a full-time living
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.200]   doing creative work by leveraging
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.220]   the potential of the internet.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.000]   It required that we escape the social media walled gardens.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.200]   It required that we got more comfortable
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.320]   spending money for digital content.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.920]   But I think this is a good thing that's happening.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.200]   All right, so that's what my article is about.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.280]   Two quick follow-up points after that article came out.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.940]   One, I talked to Kevin Kelly a little bit
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.300]   after it came out and he confirmed actually more recently,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.220]   he gets more and more notes from people
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.660]   who read that original essay
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.740]   and are successfully making a living
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.640]   with a small but dedicated group of fans.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.840]   So he can confirm directly,
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.000]   he hears from people succeeding with that more and more.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.120]   The other point, and I'll make this briefly,
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.020]   someone sent me a note and I hear this critique a lot.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.260]   So let me just address it real briefly.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.380]   They say, yeah, maybe it's true
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.880]   that there's more avenues now
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.280]   to make a living creatively online, but it's really hard.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.680]   And it often requires whatever timing and luck
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   and Crystal and Sagar already had media backgrounds.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.940]   And it's not just like anyone can just go and do this.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.480]   And my reaction to that is yes, of course.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.960]   Making a living doing creative work is really hard.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.320]   It requires talent and it requires luck
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.160]   and it requires opportunity.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.660]   Now, I think what we're seeing
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.000]   with the thousand true fans models
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.440]   that opportunity piece has vastly broadened.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.600]   You don't have to be one of the vanishingly small few
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.560]   to get on cable news or have a newspaper column now.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.720]   There's a lot more opportunities with the internet
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.660]   to make a living creatively,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.380]   but you still need the talent timing, luck portion of that.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.240]   And most people just don't have that.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.400]   But I think that's always the case
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.480]   where we're talking about the democratizing
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.100]   any type of media.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.800]   This is always the critique that comes back.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.040]   Blogs come along and they say,
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.360]   hey, this is gonna really revolutionize print.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.760]   Now anyone can publish print.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.360]   You don't have to be in a newspaper.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.000]   And the people said, oh, that revolution failed
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   because most blogs are bad.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.260]   Of course, most blogs are bad,
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.120]   but it did open up a lot more people
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.700]   who had a lot of talent and a lot of luck
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   to actually find an audience
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.800]   that would have been able to before.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.040]   Same thing with podcasts.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.080]   People say most podcasts are bad and don't make money.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.280]   That's true, but it opened up a lot more opportunity
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.920]   for a lot more people with talent and luck
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.360]   to actually go and do that before podcasts were available.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.220]   So I think that's the key caveat I wanna make
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.160]   is that there's no technological revolution
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.940]   that's gonna mean anyone who wants to make a living
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.840]   doing creative work can.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.360]   That's always gonna be really hard,
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.080]   but it used to be that you had an incredibly narrow group
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.840]   of people who even had a shot.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.120]   Now a lot more people have a shot to take.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.640]   Then of course, most people will still miss it,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.360]   but we're gonna have vastly more successful creatives
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.560]   'cause there's vastly more people out there with talent
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.280]   and the right timing and the right thing to say
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.520]   or the right skill for the moment.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.800]   There's vastly more people out there
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.100]   than there used to be opportunities to support them.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.000]   And so I think that's all a good thing.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.520]   So there you go.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.460]   A little injection of optimism
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:50.460]   into a otherwise normally grim topic area.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.120]   There are some good things happening with the internet.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   - Did it take you a long time to write that?
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.480]   - Yeah, it took a little while, like 5,000 words.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.980]   Those are longer pieces.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.560]   But honestly, this one was in production longer
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.760]   than it probably took me to write it.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   I mean, so what I did was there's kind of a break
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.360]   in my writing.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.920]   My last column was in January.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.560]   And then I had to kind of take a break
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.760]   because of administrative stuff at Georgetown.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   When I turned my energy back to this article,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.560]   it took me a month.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.480]   I went back and looked at it.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.400]   A month of solid work to get it done.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.080]   I did that back in March.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.040]   And then there's just production,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.820]   just, you know, it takes a long time.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.880]   So yeah, that took about a month of work.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.600]   Whereas my column from last fall,
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.680]   it'd take about a week of work per column.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.200]   - Do you talk to Kevin Kelly a lot?
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.480]   - No, just off and on.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.080]   Yeah, we just kind of--
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.920]   - How old is he?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   He's like in his 60s, right?
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.740]   Or is he older? - Older, yeah.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.680]   Probably now in his 70s.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.920]   - He's on Ferris' podcast every now and then, right?
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.200]   - Yeah, he's a cool guy.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.120]   Yeah, he sent me some stuff.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.000]   Not gonna talk about it now
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.720]   because I'm gonna write about it.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.480]   But he sent me some new thoughts he had on some things.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.360]   Really creative guy.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.360]   There's a classic Kevin Kelly article
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.400]   from five or six years ago on artificial intelligence
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.240]   and WIRED.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.060]   Everyone should go back and read it.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.280]   It's really good, really prophetic.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.920]   All right, well, speaking of making a living
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.600]   doing creative work online,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.460]   before we jump into our questions,
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.400]   I wanna talk about one of the sponsors
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.320]   that makes this show possible.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.520]   It's a new sponsor of the show,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.400]   but probably one you've heard of before,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.800]   and that is BetterHelp.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.360]   I mean, one of the things I have been hearing about a lot
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.440]   and reporting on a lot is the epidemic of burnout
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.160]   that we see happening out there,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.140]   especially after the stresses of the pandemic.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.080]   Symptoms of burnout include lack of motivation,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.480]   irritability, fatigue, and more.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.260]   Now, we often associate burnout with work.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.560]   That's what I often write about,
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.800]   but it's not the only cause.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.340]   Any of our roles in life can lead us to feel burnt out.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.720]   BetterHelp Online Therapy wants to remind you
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.440]   to prioritize yourself.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.260]   Talking with someone can help you figure out
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.160]   what's causing stress in your life.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.080]   We'll say the timing has probably never been better
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.440]   for a service like BetterHelp.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.240]   Just based off of multiple conversations
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.600]   I've had with people I know,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   there is a lot of people out here right now
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.860]   that do feel burnt out, do wanna prioritize themselves,
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.680]   but when they're looking for,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.320]   let's say therapists to talk to,
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.800]   there's only so many that happen to be
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.280]   physically located nearby,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.260]   and a lot of these offices are full.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.280]   They have waiting lists.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.200]   This is where a service like BetterHelp enters the scene.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.840]   BetterHelp is a customized online therapy
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.400]   that offers video, phone,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.680]   and even live chat sessions with your therapist.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.160]   So you don't have to see anyone on camera
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.760]   if you don't want to.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.220]   It's much more affordable than in-person therapy,
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.760]   and you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.440]   Our listeners get 10% off their first month at BetterHelp
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:21.380]   if they go to betterhelp.com/deepquestions.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:27.280]   That's betterhelp.com/deepquestions.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:34.680]   We also wanna talk about stamps.com.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.340]   This is true.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.160]   I have to go to the post office
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.380]   right after we record this for a sort of arcane reason,
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.640]   and I'm not really looking forward to it,
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.300]   having to go walk down to find it, wait in the line.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.540]   It is exactly avoiding having to do that on a regular basis
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:57.540]   is exactly why you need to consider stamps.com.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.140]   Stamps.com saves you time, money, and stress.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.100]   For more than 20 years,
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.740]   stamps.com has been indispensable
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.720]   for over 1 million businesses.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.860]   It gives you access to all of the post office
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.700]   and UPS shipping services,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.700]   and you can get access to them right from your computer.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.540]   They also give you discounts, like up to 20% off,
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.980]   30% off, I should say, UPS rates.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   USPS, USPS, that's US Postal Service, and 86% off UPS.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.940]   Jesse, we have a competition now.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.460]   What's harder, ZocDoc.com or USPS versus UPS?
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.940]   - We have some competition.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.160]   - Probably the latter.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.200]   I can't even say it.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.240]   - USPS, UPS.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.220]   - I'm a pro.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   You can streamline your shipping process
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.140]   with stamps.com's easy to use software.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.240]   All you need is a computer and a printer.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.380]   You can print official postage for any letter,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.740]   any package, anywhere you want to send.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.700]   It works seamlessly with Shopify, Amazon, Etsy, eBay,
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.060]   and more, so whether you're sending invoices,
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.780]   or you're in Etsy shops in your products,
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.060]   or a warehouse shipping out your orders,
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.860]   stamps.com is your mailing and shipping solution.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.100]   So stop wasting time and start saving money
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.180]   when you use stamps.com to mail and ship.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.960]   Sign up with promo code "deep" for a special offer
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.220]   that includes a four week trial,
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.020]   plus free postage and a digital scale.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.060]   No long-term commitments or contracts.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.860]   Just go to stamps.com, click the microphone
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.360]   at the top of the page, and enter the code "deep".
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.860]   From USPS to UPS, from ZocDoc.com
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.500]   to Sally's Seashells by the seashore,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.260]   stamps.com is where you need to go.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.500]   - See, that's just called professionalism, Jesse.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.340]   - Radio voice.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.220]   - Articulation, enunciation.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.260]   That's what they teach us in radio school.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.500]   You know, my dad actually went to school for radio.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.780]   Like, was a broadcast major.
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   - Yeah, you mentioned that he was on the radio, right?
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.760]   - Yeah.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.380]   When he was still in college, he was also the news guy
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.980]   at the local news, the sports guy, I think,
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.040]   at the local TV station.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.780]   And then when he was in the army,
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:13.340]   he, at the National Guard, he ran a radio station
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.020]   at the, you know, on the base or whatever.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.640]   That was his guard duty.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.540]   And then, yeah, he left academia to host his own radio show.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.300]   - Does he give you tips about you?
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.420]   - He's got a great radio voice.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.700]   Yeah, I've got a garbage radio voice compared.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.700]   But a lot of it's training.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.540]   You can train your radio voice.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.540]   A lot of it is more air and enunciation,
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.180]   and you can bring out the resonance
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.540]   in the resonance chambers.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.540]   It's a whole art to--
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.780]   - Oh, I'm sure, yeah.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.580]   - But it's why, you know, he was born and raised in Texas.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.640]   I was born and raised in Texas till I was eight.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.500]   Never an accent.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:53.340]   Because he was trained in radio and TV back then.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.940]   You were trained with the Johnny Carson Midwest accent.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   So it's the American accent with no inflection of any type.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.880]   That was the broadcasting voice.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.260]   So we did not grow up in a house with Southern accents.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.460]   - Nice, so there you go.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.140]   Trivia.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.860]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:16.140]   All right, our first question comes from H,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:22.140]   who asks, "How do I get over fear of starting a business?
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.780]   I've always wanted to be entrepreneurial
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.840]   to maximize autonomy over my life
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.580]   and alignment of what I do in my career with my values.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.380]   But I have a lack of confidence in my personal skills
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.580]   or any domain expertise.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.340]   And more than that, I'm very, very scared
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.480]   of the risk of entrepreneurism.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.760]   Do you have any advice?"
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.660]   Well, H, the right advice for you, I think,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.780]   can be found in my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.860]   And in that book, I introduced the idea,
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.660]   which we've talked about on the show before,
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.660]   of money acting as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.940]   It's a term that I borrowed
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.560]   from the entrepreneur, Derek Sivers.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:12.700]   Now, the concept here is the way you de-risk
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.660]   a change in your career, especially a change,
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.540]   let's say, from a steady paycheck job
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.140]   to an entrepreneurial vision,
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.380]   is that you look to see
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.020]   if you can make money on the new thing.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.100]   You don't ask people, "Is this a good idea?"
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.620]   You don't ask people,
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.500]   "Do you think I should go out on my own
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.460]   and start this business?"
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.620]   You don't just look to your gut
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.020]   and say, "What's my passion?
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.660]   Or what do I feel like doing?"
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.660]   You instead, on the side, start doing, to a reduced degree,
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.500]   the thing you are considering
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.940]   and see if people will give you money.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.660]   Because here's the thing,
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.660]   it costs me nothing to tell you something's a good idea.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.500]   It costs me nothing to compliment you.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.940]   It costs me nothing to get you fired up
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.780]   about going big and betting on yourself.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.300]   That costs me nothing.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.700]   And I'll just do that, why not?
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.380]   I'm a nice guy, I don't wanna be mean to you.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.460]   But you want my money.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.420]   Now that's different.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.420]   People are different about that.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.340]   They're not gonna give you their money
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.340]   unless they actually value what they're getting.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.900]   And so Derek Sivers says,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.340]   "Use money as a neutral indicator value."
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.700]   It's a way of evaluating, is this business idea good?
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.540]   Can I get clients?
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.420]   Will they pay me?
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.180]   Can I sell these things?
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.700]   Derek Sivers used this to,
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.900]   before he left his job as an A&R executive
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.060]   to become a full-time musician,
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.620]   "Can I make enough money of gigs on the side
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.740]   to replace my salary?
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.180]   Then I will quit the A&R job."
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.860]   And when he left his job as a musician
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.180]   to start a online music company, CD Baby,
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.420]   he ran it on the side
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.020]   until he was making enough money to support him.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.580]   And then he quit touring to work on the company.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.540]   So if you're really, really worried,
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.940]   let that worry be your motivation to use this strategy.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.700]   Get a specific idea.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.980]   Run it on the side.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.780]   See if you can make money.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.660]   And if you're making enough money to live off of,
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.380]   then you won't have the fear,
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.820]   or at least your fear will be greatly diminished.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.180]   And if you're not making enough money to live on,
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.020]   that's a great signal.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.020]   That means don't go quit your job.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.740]   Don't go try to do this new thing.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.100]   There be dragons.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.860]   I'm surprised how often people skip this step
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.980]   because they don't want the answer.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.620]   They love the romance of doing something different.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.500]   They love the romance of what life would be like
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.420]   if they didn't have a boss,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.660]   but they don't want to confront the reality
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.020]   that their idea might not be that good,
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.420]   that people might not actually pay them,
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.660]   they might not actually make a living.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.900]   So they avoid this step
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.100]   'cause they don't want an obstacle
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.340]   to the thing that they want to be true.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.420]   And I think it's a very dangerous way
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.420]   to go about career shifts.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.140]   So H, try what you want to do.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.340]   See if you get paid for it.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.380]   If you don't, try something else.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.420]   If you do, your fear should be pretty diminished.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.420]   All right, we got another question here.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.700]   Ooh, it's a dangerous one.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.580]   Maybe I'll have Jesse answer this one.
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.460]   Rob asks, "How can I convince my wife
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.660]   that I mean it when I say I have a deep session
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.340]   from say 10 a.m. to 12 noon and I am unavailable?
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.580]   My wife does not take me seriously
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.220]   when I say I need to focus on something.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.580]   She thinks blocking off hours is unrealistic
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.540]   and I should handle her spontaneous inquiries
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.220]   in a timely manner because she is my wife
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.580]   and our family comes first.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.940]   How would you deal with that?"
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.060]   But Jesse, I always get nervous
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.780]   when people ask me for relationship advice.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.020]   I don't want to get in the middle of it.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.820]   What would you say to Rob?
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.140]   Always listen to your wife?
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.940]   It's usually good advice, actually.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.060]   It's a good question.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.220]   All right, I will answer this with care, Rob.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:54.540]   So my immediate answer is I agree with you
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.700]   and not your wife on the point of whether or not
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.540]   it is reasonable for you to have sessions during the day
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.260]   in which you're locked in and not, let's say,
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.020]   looking at text messages coming in on your phone
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.220]   or answering your phone.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.020]   That's completely reasonable.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.460]   There are many, many jobs where that's unavoidable.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.460]   And if you're an airline pilot or an athlete
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.940]   or a professor or a classroom teacher or a podcaster,
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.180]   there's clearly times in your day
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.220]   where you can't be reached.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.260]   Like there's no way you can take a call
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.700]   or there's no way you can do text messages.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.140]   And all of those people are fine.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.020]   Even the pilots and the athletes and the teachers
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.180]   and the podcasters who have families,
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.580]   we don't hear about rashes of disasters that happen
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.820]   because they couldn't be reached
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.820]   while they were in the classroom,
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.300]   while they're up in the air.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.860]   And it's one of the real issues with these jobs.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.780]   They're fine and it works fine.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.740]   And so it's not some unreasonable, weird thing.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.940]   There's plenty of jobs where it's the case
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.900]   where there's just times where you can't be reached.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.260]   And I talked about this point in my book,
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.700]   Digital Minimalism.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:04.300]   It was like a minute ago, relatively speaking,
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.180]   that it was very hard to reach people.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:12.080]   It wasn't that long ago that if you weren't at your desk,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.420]   no one could reach you.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.660]   Before we had cell phones,
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.940]   and that again, wasn't that long ago,
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.100]   no one could reach you.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.380]   I mean, I remember this.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.460]   Even as like a college student doing interviews,
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:27.020]   I remember going out to interview at Microsoft 21
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.860]   or whatever, I don't know,
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.220]   it was a senior year in college or something like that.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.980]   It was before cell phones, I didn't have a cell phone.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.440]   I remember, you drive in,
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.140]   you go to the rental car counter at the Seattle airport,
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.540]   and they kind of give you a map and they draw on it.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.860]   And I remember getting lost and at some point,
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.940]   finding a gas station and like using a payphone
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.020]   and a calling card.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.220]   And I called my house, like,
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.980]   dad, do you have an Atlas there?
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.100]   What road, I'm on highway, whatever.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.060]   And he looked it up, you know, like that's the way things,
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.100]   that's the way things work.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.100]   Our parents would go out on dates,
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.900]   we'd have a babysitter and they would be unreachable
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.740]   till they got home.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.860]   They had a restaurant, they had a movie,
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.240]   we all survived, it was all fine.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.300]   All right, so my main answer is no,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.020]   it's not fundamentally unreasonable
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.780]   that you are not reachable.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.500]   There are some things you can do to help.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.600]   So if you're time blocking,
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.420]   work with your family or your partner
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.020]   to go over your time block schedule for the day
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.220]   so there's some clarity.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.220]   Oh, here's the part of the day where I'm gonna be locked in
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.040]   and not available.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   So like, you might wanna grab me right before that
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.380]   or know that during this time,
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.340]   you're not gonna be able to get through me
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.360]   because there's often a frustration where it's unpredictable.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.780]   If it's, oh, I just never know.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.380]   I never know when Rob's available.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.560]   He just doesn't answer his phone.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.880]   That's more frustrating than I know
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.740]   there's this two hour block and this one hour block
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.540]   where he won't be available, but he will be otherwise.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.900]   That makes it a lot better.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.820]   Rob, I would also suggest that you proactively check in.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.100]   If you're about to go on a two hour locked in,
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.260]   focused, deep work block,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.260]   maybe call your wife first.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.100]   Be like, hey, what's going on?
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.100]   I'm about to be off the radar for a while.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.220]   And you could deal with a lot of things
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.700]   that have built up right then.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.420]   And then otherwise just apologize.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.900]   I apologize all the time.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.340]   Family members, friends, people are always trying to reach me
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.300]   and it's not even like I'm actively trying
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.020]   to turn off my devices and lock in.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.540]   I just, my phone doesn't work.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.420]   I mean, Jesse knows this.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.380]   I don't know why,
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:30.380]   but this thing, if it's in whatever, vibrate mode,
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.700]   if a call comes in or there's a text message,
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.300]   it's like the gentlest breeze slightly shifted it.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.420]   I mean, you would have to put this right next
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.260]   to the needle of an incredibly sensitive seismograph.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.460]   To even know that this thing shook, it's crazy.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.420]   And then when I put it on ring, like, okay,
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.980]   so now I really don't want to miss a call.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.820]   It's like,
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:58.060]   and it kind of goes silent again.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.340]   There's no way for me to know.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.660]   So like, and this is true.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.900]   The only time I ever am able to answer calls
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.380]   or respond in a timely fashion to a text message
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.660]   is if I happen to be holding using the phone.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.940]   Like text messages, the main reason I respond
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.260]   to text messages is because it also comes up on my computer.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.140]   So like if I'm on my computer, a message will pop up.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.060]   I never catch them on here unless I happen to be holding it.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.660]   I never catch calls, not because I'm trying to be all deep
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:25.940]   and smart and disconnected,
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.640]   but because my phone doesn't work.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.980]   Now, in fairness, I don't really do a lot
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.940]   to try to fix that.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.300]   I don't know why it doesn't work,
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.900]   but anyways, I just apologize a lot.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.420]   That's what I would say to do also, Rob,
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:41.740]   is do your work and then apologize later
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:42.580]   if someone gets mad at you.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.420]   Like I tried to reach you,
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.340]   you're like, you know, sorry, I was working on whatever,
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.580]   but I'm available now.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.620]   Eventually people adjust.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.180]   Eventually people adjust.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.100]   And so those are my immediate reactions.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.860]   There's a bigger observation here,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.700]   and it's a bigger topic than I can handle right now,
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.340]   but I just wanna plant this seed.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.860]   In my book, "A World Without Email,"
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.300]   I talked about the rise of the hyperactive hive mind
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.680]   in the context of work.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.620]   So using unstructured back and forth ad hoc messages
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.940]   over email and Slack or Teams or whatever tool
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.860]   as our primary way of doing collaboration,
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.860]   coordination in the workplace
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.940]   and how this is a real issue
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.940]   because we have to constantly be check you did.
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.340]   Well, the same thing is happening
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.040]   in people's personal lives.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.620]   The personal hyperactive hive mind is also an issue.
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.900]   And this is where you're just constantly
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.860]   stage managing multiple ongoing conversations,
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.780]   typically over text messages for the younger people,
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.260]   sometimes WhatsApp as well.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.740]   There's just all of these different messages
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.580]   going back and forth.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.400]   Well, what about this?
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.240]   And how do we arrange this?
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.360]   And when are you gonna come over here?
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.460]   And just like with the professional hyperactive hive mind,
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.300]   it's incredibly convenient.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.220]   If everyone can kind of just answer messages right away,
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.900]   you can just have a lot of plates in the air.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.180]   You can be doing a lot of arranging of things over here
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.940]   and figuring out when am I gonna meet you for lunch?
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.540]   And can we do this carpool over here?
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.380]   And what do you think about this?
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.460]   It's all very convenient in the moment,
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.420]   but it creates a tempo of life
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.580]   that is cognitively speaking almost unlivable
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.340]   because it is constant context shifting and disruption.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.480]   It's a bifurcated experience of the world
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.940]   where it's constantly what's in front of me
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.780]   and what's on the screen,
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.860]   what's in front of me, what's on the screen,
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.500]   and you can't get away from it.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.060]   But it's so convenient that once you're in that world,
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.660]   it's hard to get out.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.020]   And once the people you know are in that world,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.100]   it will make their life harder if you leave.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.740]   So there's this issue of the personal hyperactive hive mind
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.340]   that we don't discuss as much,
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.380]   but I think is just as serious in some cases
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.020]   as the negative impacts of the professional
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.860]   knowledge work hyperactive hive mind.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.300]   I don't know exactly how to solve it.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.260]   I mean, I think informal office hours
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.620]   probably goes a long way towards this solution.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.060]   So imagine there's just sort of set hours every day
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.460]   where you know you're gonna be with your phone
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.140]   and you're doing errands and tasks
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.480]   and pushing people towards those.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.680]   Informally, you know, not making a big deal about it,
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.800]   but just like, yeah, yeah, call me.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.640]   Yeah, anywhere between one and four,
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.080]   like call me or text or whatever, let's get into this.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.040]   Proactively reaching out to people during that time,
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.880]   that's when you make your calls or text to people,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.800]   like, hey, there's seven things
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.880]   I wanna check in with you on.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.640]   I think something like that probably helps.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.120]   So you can still catch up with people and organize things,
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   but not have to have it be all the time.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.320]   To discuss, so the term to discuss list
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.400]   are probably useful here.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.840]   Kind of keep track of, okay, next time I talk to Rob,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.000]   I wanna talk to him about this, but also this, also this.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.600]   And then in your next informal office hours,
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.320]   you call him or text him.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.160]   And if he's around,
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.440]   then you have like a bunch of things you get through
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.960]   as opposed to as soon as you have the thought,
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.840]   you immediately send off the text so it gets off your mind.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.120]   So I think there are solutions.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.840]   I don't wanna give a comprehensive set of solutions
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.820]   right now 'cause I haven't thought a ton about this yet,
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.040]   but I think this is a bigger topic.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.760]   The personal hyperactive hive mind is having a real,
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.280]   I think, negative impact on people's
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.640]   day-to-day present experience.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.720]   And it's something we need to think about
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.020]   just as much as we think about what's going on
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.740]   in the workplace.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.080]   All right, there's a couple of questions.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.640]   Yeah. - Do you have the iMessage
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.260]   pop up when you're doing your writing?
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.960]   - Yeah, I don't know how to turn it off.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.320]   - Does that distract you?
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   - I just ignore it.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.120]   Now, so I'm a big Scrivener fan.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.480]   So if I'm really in sentence crafting mode,
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.600]   I'm in composition mode where it takes up the full screen,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.600]   and I don't think the iMessage pops up then.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.540]   So if I'm taking notes or pulling notes,
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.520]   like I have the multi-panes going on Scrivener,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.060]   then it can pop up, but I just ignore it.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.600]   Like, I guess I can see it, but no, I think I ignore it.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.280]   The problem, the place where it's a problem,
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.020]   because again, I don't know how to use any of this technology.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.600]   The places where it's a problem is if I'm doing
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.080]   like a phone interview with a reporter,
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.280]   and if my family gets going on some sort of back and forth,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.980]   it's just like, like it doesn't come through.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.120]   It's not like the reporter can hear it,
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.400]   but it's very hard to concentrate
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.880]   when your phone is basically just shaking constantly
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.520]   as these conversations are going on.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.640]   I mean, I figured out how to turn it off,
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.960]   but then I forget to turn it back on,
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.400]   and a month will go by where I miss all text messages.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.840]   So I don't know.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.840]   I mean, phones used to ring, right?
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.720]   I used to have cell phones where it's like,
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.360]   ring, like it was loud.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.480]   You'd hear it across the house.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.080]   - Yeah, mine has trouble.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.120]   Like when I put mine on ring,
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.040]   it doesn't always ring either.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.280]   Most of the time I have mine like on, doesn't do anything.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.360]   So then I just have missed calls and I call people back.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.040]   - Yeah, like if you called my phone,
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.920]   do you ever, I don't know, is your phone nearby?
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.760]   - Yeah.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.600]   - Let me call my phone.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.840]   Look, let's do an experiment here.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:52.240]   I turned off the silent mode.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.760]   All right, Jesse's gonna call my phone.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.160]   I'm holding it near the mic.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:05.000]   Hear that?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.480]   Like you can kind of hear it.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.000]   Like there's a wind chime across the field.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.080]   Like I'm holding this right up to the mic.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:15.680]   It's silent, right?
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.240]   - Yeah, it's pretty big.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.880]   - Technically it's making a sound.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.720]   - Yeah.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.720]   - It's technically making a sound.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.840]   You would have to be in a dead silent room
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.120]   to even notice that.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.640]   I would describe that as four houses down.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.080]   The wind chime is sort of gently, right?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.800]   All right, Jesse confirms.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   It's not my fault that I miss all calls.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.040]   There we go.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.880]   I'm sure there's just a setting.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.280]   It's like a volume is turned down somewhere.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.240]   All right, well, speaking about calls, let's do a call.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.320]   - All right, sounds good.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.000]   - Hey Cal, I hope you're doing well.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:51.960]   My name is Daniel.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.400]   I am 29 years old and I am a music business
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.120]   development strategist for a large tech company.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.320]   I'm a big fan of your work.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.600]   I've read most of your books
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.960]   and your books actually helped me double my salary
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.240]   earlier this year.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.520]   That came with me being put into a position
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.520]   that is very much in line with where I want to go
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.760]   in my career and leverages my existing skillset
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.160]   and knowledge base quite well.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.480]   So thank you very much for that.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.080]   However, with life being life and loving to throw curve
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.760]   balls about a week after this promotion,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.240]   I also got the news that my girlfriend had been diagnosed
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.720]   with a very aggressive and fast moving cancer.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.080]   We live in a city where it's just turned to I,
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.200]   we don't have any family nearby.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   So I am in the position of being her full-time caregiver.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.680]   I did take some time off at the beginning
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.280]   right after the diagnosis to adjust to our new lifestyle.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.360]   But as she settled more into her chemotherapy routine,
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.520]   I have a bit more time to be able to devote to my work.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.360]   My bosses have been very understanding with everything,
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.400]   which has been amazing.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.640]   They've given me the space and time I need to come up
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.760]   with a schedule that works for me.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.120]   I'm finding it very difficult to even just sit down
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.120]   and think about beginning to get into a deep work state.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   I understand that I am going through a bit
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.440]   of a stressful time right now,
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.400]   and my priorities do have to shift for me
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.160]   to properly navigate this.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.160]   But these deep work sessions before the cancer diagnosis
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.680]   were very therapeutic for me.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.240]   I got a lot of gratification and confidence from them.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.200]   And it's a feeling that I feel like I could really
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.720]   use right now in this situation.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.120]   Trying to find that balancing act
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.240]   between full-time cancer caregiving and deep work
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.160]   probably requires some form of deep work.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.160]   So any idea or comments that you would have
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.320]   that could help me navigate this stressful period
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.160]   that I'm going through would be greatly appreciated.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.840]   Thank you so much for everything, Cal.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.080]   Big fan of your work.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.040]   Can't wait to read your next book when it comes out.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.480]   - Well, Daniel, sorry to hear about
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.080]   the news with your girlfriend.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:54.200]   My immediate instinct is to pull back, work-wise.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:57:00.160]   Pull back, and by pull back, I mean,
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.560]   let's officially, temporarily,
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.440]   but let's officially downgrade responsibilities.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.880]   By downgrade, I mean reduce.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.200]   Reduce responsibilities.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.360]   So this might be stepping back from the promotion
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.760]   in the form that you got it.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.640]   However, I would go into that
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.000]   with the mindset of less but better.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.600]   I think the therapeutic nature of getting lost
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.760]   in some sort of craft, professional craft,
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.800]   I think that's important,
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.560]   and you don't want to abandon that.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.000]   And so doing less but better,
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.360]   so I'm doing less total work,
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.400]   but when I am working,
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.760]   I am, the smaller number of things I'm working on,
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.040]   I'm giving it attention when it's time to work,
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.680]   and getting the therapy of that,
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.720]   the therapeutic benefit of doing that deeply,
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.240]   I think that would be important.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.520]   Now, you're gonna have to structure this work more.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.080]   You're gonna have to have ritual around it more.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.480]   Your mind is understandably
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.320]   being pulled in a lot of directions.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.560]   I think there's few things that the human brain
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.240]   is wired to take more seriously
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.760]   than a loved one in distress.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.080]   So you're probably gonna have to lean
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.440]   pretty heavily in the ritual.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.960]   So it's less work because there's less you can do,
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.160]   but when you do it,
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.760]   you go to a certain location
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.480]   that's just for that type of work,
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:23.280]   and you can set yourself up to get lost into it temporarily.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.040]   That's what I would do.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.080]   And then you can go back to
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.640]   leveraging the career capital and promotions.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.720]   Look, if you could do that once,
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.200]   you'll be able to do that throughout that career.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.320]   That means you know how, when conditions are right,
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.520]   they'll lock in and focus and create valuable work.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.320]   And you have a whole career ahead of you
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.960]   in which you're able to do that.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.640]   But we get back to the fundamental question of like,
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.040]   what's the point of, let's say, work and deep work?
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.080]   It's like, well, it could be valuable
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.280]   and important part of your life.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.240]   All right, well, obviously care for a loved one
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.880]   is also valuable, important part of your life.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.240]   So that's the thing that is valuable in your life
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.160]   that you're putting a lot of energy into now.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.080]   At another stage, you'll be putting your energy,
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.120]   let's say, back into work.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.520]   At another stage, you will be dropping a lot of energy
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.560]   maybe into raising kids.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:05.640]   There's all sorts of different things
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.080]   that come up and down in your life,
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.920]   in the course of a deep life that are important,
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.760]   and your energy changes accordingly.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.480]   So that's my instinct is to not just informally
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.320]   pull back from your work,
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.060]   but I think there's a relief in making it formal.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:24.640]   I wanna temporarily restructure my work.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.920]   We all agree, we pull back on the money
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:31.760]   and cut back on what I'm doing,
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.840]   but leave a portfolio of a small number of things
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.640]   that you do really well and you can get lost into,
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.060]   but it's not overwhelming.
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.440]   You have flexibility, you have time affluence.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.720]   It doesn't take up all your time.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.480]   It doesn't demand more than your diminished
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.680]   cognitive reservoir has to offer at this particular point.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.600]   And that's where I put my focus.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.040]   Other seasons of life will have other focuses.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.580]   So anyways, I'm sorry for your situation.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:59.280]   I think you're doing the right thing.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.440]   I think going forward with something like I'm talking about,
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.160]   if it sounds right to you,
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.480]   I think might give you that balance
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.380]   of focusing on what matters, living deeply,
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.960]   balancing these different things
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.200]   in a way that gives you the best overall outcome.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.320]   All right, let's see here.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.220]   We got a written question from Sam.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.800]   Sam asked, what is the potential of AI
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   in productivity optimization and how will it work?
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.520]   Well, my theory on this, my prediction on this,
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.520]   my, maybe I say my optimistic or wistful hope
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.920]   for the role of AI in the future of work
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.100]   is going to be the AI chief of staff.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:57.200]   So I've long argued, this is the natural terminal point
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.280]   for the intersection of AI with in particular knowledge work
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.420]   or office work is being able to implement a software,
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.200]   something like a chief of staff role.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.680]   But for many more positions than we could ever afford
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.720]   to actually have chief of staff.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   So obviously we think of chief of staff,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.760]   it's a prominent role in political life.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.400]   The president of the United States
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.220]   famously has a chief of staff.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.920]   West wing fans know about Leo McGarry on the West wing
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.000]   and they really manage the president's life.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.480]   Like you never see the president
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.560]   if you watch the West wing,
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.460]   you never see Martin Sheen's character looking at calendars
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.800]   or going through email or trying to figure out
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.640]   what should I be working on?
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.460]   The chief of staff comes in,
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.600]   okay, here's what you're doing next.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.080]   All right, now we have to go meet with this person.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.160]   Okay, I need you to read this, read this briefing packet.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.080]   You're gonna need it when we meet
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.120]   with the joint chief of staff later or whatever, right?
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.240]   That idea then made its way into the business world.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.200]   A lot of it is big in Silicon Valley,
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.880]   a lot of big Silicon Valley CEO
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.280]   and entrepreneur investor types,
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.760]   hire chief of staff to help organize
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.840]   these parts of their lives so they could focus more
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.680]   on actually where they add value.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.420]   Yeah, there's this little insider,
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.480]   Cal Newport tidbit,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.560]   but if you look at the back of "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.760]   my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.680]   I have a blurb from Reid Hoffman,
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.640]   the co-founder of LinkedIn
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.520]   and it's big investment fund now
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.600]   is one of the PayPal mafia types from way back when.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.840]   I have that blurb because my longtime
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.980]   and good friend Ben Kastnoka at the time
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.680]   was Reid Hoffman's chief of staff.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.240]   And that's how Ben got started in the Silicon Valley world.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.240]   Anyways, AI might make these accessible to individuals.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.380]   So in this vision,
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:52.520]   your AI chief of staff entirely implemented in software,
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.080]   it's a software agent,
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.380]   helps you actually organize your work day
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.440]   to the extent that you no longer are in email,
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.760]   you're no longer like even really looking at calendars,
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.520]   it is communicating with other AI agents,
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.840]   figuring out what you should be working on,
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.400]   getting you the materials you need,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.320]   helping to figure out your day
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.240]   so that like the president of the United States,
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.080]   when you come into your office, your AI agent is like,
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.760]   "Look, I know you're working on whatever,
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.180]   this initiative, this report you're writing,
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.600]   I've gathered resources for you,
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.080]   they're in this folder over here.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.320]   By the way, there's a couple of meetings
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.140]   we put on your calendar for this afternoon
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.560]   because so-and-so need to meet you this,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.880]   but don't worry, they're in the calendar,
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.320]   I'll get you the information when we get there
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.640]   and then in the afternoon,
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.920]   you need to check in on X, Y, and Z later,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.800]   don't worry, when we get there,
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.080]   I'll load up the information you need
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.120]   to remind you of where we are
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.480]   and tell you where that information needs to go,
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.640]   oh, at the end of the day, we need to sign these things,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.240]   or whatever, you know what I'm talking about?
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.920]   AI will be able to do that
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.760]   and it will leave cognitively skilled knowledge workers
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.800]   to spend most of their time
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.640]   actually applying their hard work skills
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.760]   to adding value to information,
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.160]   like doing the fundamental act,
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.280]   the fundamental act of knowledge work,
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.760]   economic value creation,
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.520]   and I think that will be transformative
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.080]   for that economic sector,
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.760]   I think that will increase the output,
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.800]   so the value created per skilled knowledge worker
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.240]   will increase by a factor of two to five,
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.560]   this is gonna be so powerful
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.280]   that it might have unexpected negative ramifications,
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.940]   if we become that much more productive,
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.160]   we might actually see reductions
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.680]   in how many people we need to run
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.800]   various industrial knowledge sectors,
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.160]   anyway, this will be, I think,
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.800]   the future of AI enhanced productivity,
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.120]   it's not just speculation,
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.680]   I've talked to CEOs of knowledge work AI companies
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.120]   that talk about this as being the goal,
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.360]   AI agents that talk to other people's AI agents
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.160]   and help organize your workday,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.460]   so it's possible that AI is going to eliminate
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.080]   this world of hyperactive hive mind,
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.120]   overhead spiraling, constant communication collaboration
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.280]   that afflicts us today,
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.760]   the fact that we have to do that all on behalf of ourselves
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   is a perhaps a temporary dark period
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.800]   in the history of this economic sector
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.320]   and maybe AI will be part of the solution,
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.040]   before we get there, I will just add,
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.440]   we can solve a lot of these problems
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.660]   even without that technology,
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.920]   just through more structured processes
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.720]   and more intelligent approaches to how we collaborate
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.720]   and this is what my book,
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.280]   "A World Without Email" is all about,
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.840]   so we don't have to wait for the AI chiefs of staff
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.520]   to free ourselves from this unproductive overhead,
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.880]   we can start making changes right now,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   but eventually whether or not we make those changes
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.660]   in our processes, AI, I think will save us.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:49.240]   All right, Jesse, I have a new segment I wanna try,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.320]   as you know, I maintain an email address,
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.060]   interesting@calnewport.com,
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.920]   which is just open for people to send me things
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.520]   they think I might find interesting,
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.200]   articles, case studies, stories from their own lives,
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.520]   photos, I can't answer all these emails,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.760]   I'll make that clear, 'cause I get a lot of them,
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.600]   but I read most of them
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.640]   and it's really a cool source of ideas for articles,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.400]   et cetera, well, I thought it would be cool to go back
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.340]   and occasionally pull out a cool few things
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.520]   that people sent and highlight them on the show,
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.100]   so we'll call this the interesting mailbag.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.240]   The first thing I wanna show here
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.700]   and this is gonna be better if you're watching this
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.360]   on YouTube, because there's a cool picture
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.280]   involved with this, but I'll try to explain it,
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.200]   is someone sent me a picture of a home office
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.480]   that an anthropologist and ethnobiologist/national
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.400]   geographic explorer in residence named Wade Davis,
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.960]   who lives here in Washington, DC,
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.680]   he had a fancy architecture firm,
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.520]   build them this over the top home office,
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.480]   which I really enjoyed, so if you're watching at home,
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.860]   you'll see a picture of it now on the screen.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.200]   What it is, is like an oval room,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.040]   so let me describe this to you,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.160]   it's like an oval room, there's no windows around the oval,
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.480]   it's a desk that goes all the way around the oval,
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:12.400]   and no windows, white walls, lit to kind of glow,
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.040]   and it looks like he has various,
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.360]   I don't know if these are like Native American rugs
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.720]   and pictures and artifacts against these walls,
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.080]   so you're at this completely circular desk,
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.000]   all the way around the wall is this blonde wood desk,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.480]   just looking at artifacts on a blank wall,
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.960]   up above it is a large,
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.240]   I don't know how else to think of this,
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.760]   is like a little cylindrical tower almost,
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.800]   coming out of the top of this room,
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.880]   complete circle, like a giant chimney,
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   and it's a library, it's full of books,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.000]   five rows of books all around this giant,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.800]   whatever we wanna call it, tower coming out of the office,
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.440]   there's a really long ladder that goes from the floor
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.000]   up to these books, these must be 15 feet off the ground,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.800]   so you have to walk up this ladder
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.960]   to get access to these books,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.560]   and you can't really see it in this particular photo,
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.880]   but at the very top of this tower is a giant skylight,
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.960]   and that's where all the light comes in to this office,
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.920]   is a skylight through a tower of books
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.520]   down into this windowless circular room
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.520]   with a desk going all the way around,
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.100]   so it's really striking,
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.200]   here's what they said about it,
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.240]   here's their explanation,
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.960]   their architectural statement about this,
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.120]   while many need light-filled rooms for inspiration,
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.240]   the person in question here, Wade Davis,
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.920]   wanted to avoid large window openings
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.160]   onto a residential neighborhood
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.040]   and sought a cave-like atmosphere
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.080]   to disappear into his work,
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.200]   subtle light was brought in by other means
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.640]   when the architect built a dome above the client's desk,
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.760]   which Price describes as similar to the rotunda
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.480]   of the Oracle's Temple at Delphi,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.160]   and they filled it with books that he uses most,
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:56.040]   the client, Wade Davis, whimsically calls the spaces
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.320]   Navajo Kiva of Knowledge.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.160]   So we were talking about earlier in the show
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.680]   how my wife and I are building
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.440]   this over-the-top library at our house
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.280]   for among other reasons for me to write in,
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.280]   here's another example of this philosophy
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.540]   that aesthetics matters much of functionality
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.640]   when it comes to workspace,
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.660]   it's something we should consider,
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.000]   obviously this is a cool example
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.880]   of someone building a really personalized
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.200]   and over-the-top home office,
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.620]   but I'm sure it's gonna help him do the work that he does.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.160]   All right, here's one other cool thing
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.920]   that came into the interesting @CalNewport email address,
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.320]   let me read the message that the reader sent me,
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.160]   "I just wanted to say hi from a listener
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.420]   "and reader from Mongolia.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.900]   "You mentioned recently in your podcast
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:45.160]   "the Mongolian version of Deep Work.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.200]   "I wanted to let you know that not only is it popular here,
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.360]   "but also your digital minimalism book in Mongolia
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.640]   "is a top seller too.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.320]   "I shared the attachment, a screenshot
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.480]   "of a popular book club account here
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.920]   "which recommends your books in the latest post."
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.960]   So again, if you're watching at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia,
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.200]   I'm showing this image now and you can see what Deep Work
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.960]   and digital minimalism,
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.300]   what their book covers look like in Mongolia.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.160]   So these books do really well, Jesse,
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.760]   internationally.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.200]   Now, I don't know the right way,
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.720]   like if you call this languages
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.920]   or I'm not quite sure how it works,
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.280]   but you have to sell the foreign rights of your book
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.480]   region by region.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.920]   It's like we sold the Mongolian rights of Deep Work,
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.640]   we sold the Mongolian rights of digital minimalism,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.440]   you would sell like in the Portuguese rights,
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.560]   you would sell the Brazilian rights.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.160]   So I guess it's more, I would say countries maybe,
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.440]   but sometimes you sell the rights to like the UK rights
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.160]   cover the whole British Commonwealth,
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.080]   like it covers.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.320]   So it's kind of complicated.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.380]   So it's kind of languages, it's kind of countries,
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.840]   whatever you wanna call them,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:58.840]   we're now up to like 45 different foreign territories
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.160]   or languages.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.640]   So I don't know if I say it's in 45 languages,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.160]   probably not because some of these countries
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.680]   speak the same language,
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.360]   or if it's in 45 countries,
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.080]   maybe it's more than that.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.520]   Like the French African rights covers a lot of countries,
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.120]   you know, that speak French.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.560]   So anyways, all I know is these books,
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.000]   especially Deep Work and especially digital minimalism,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.840]   there's lots of places now,
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.480]   over 40 different countries or territories and languages,
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.680]   however you wanna say it around the world
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.720]   where these books can be found.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.640]   So they've been very international.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.040]   - Your boy, Rory McIlroy,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.720]   has got a big golf tournament this weekend.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.720]   So if he wins that, he might be talking about your book.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.680]   - Yeah, he won last week, right?
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   - Yeah, this is the big weekend this weekend now.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.520]   - Yeah, so someone sent me,
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.000]   that was another thing in the interesting,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.360]   at calneupra.com address,
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.720]   someone sent me an interview with Rory
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.000]   and he had bookmarked two places.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.760]   One part where Rory talked about digital minimalism,
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.280]   and then another part where he was talking about Deep Work.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280]   So I didn't realize he was a Deep Work fan as well.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.120]   But then I looked it up
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.920]   and that interview was from a couple of years ago.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.920]   So I was going to take credit for his victory last week,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.320]   but it's been a couple of years
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.000]   since Rory's directly mentioned my books.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.440]   But I think it's sunk in.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.160]   - He probably talks about it in like the locker room.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.320]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure there,
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.280]   his caddy is tired of hearing about it.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.600]   Speaking of people who are stacked,
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.840]   that's also a gentleman.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.400]   I don't know if you've seen him recently.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.720]   - Yeah, he's a good guy. - He's a small guy
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.840]   just in general, but his arms are--
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.760]   - He crushes the ball.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.160]   - He crushes the ball, yeah.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.600]   We could be the ones to innovate that,
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.600]   you know, like Tiger Woods brought that to golf.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.040]   Being strong is like, it could help in golf before that.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.320]   It was, you know, people out of shape.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.000]   It was daily, those type of players.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.640]   I think we need to bring that to podcasting.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.640]   Being incredibly good shape is the key.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.880]   Like just being notably, notably strong.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   Maybe Joe Rogan already pushed that, I guess.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.760]   - Yeah, Jaco, Rogan. - Yeah, all right.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.360]   Andrew Huberman.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.680]   - Yeah, he's-- - Jacked, yeah.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.520]   And he's a professor.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.760]   So even in like professor academic podcasts
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.120]   where someone talks to the camera,
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.440]   okay, that's too late, I guess.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.080]   - Well, Alexander Sharzov, is that a guy's name
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.520]   from last episode? - Yeah.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.240]   - You wanna be like him, work out an hour a day
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.360]   and get absolute credit.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.760]   - Yeah, I got a shout out to Kyle Hunt
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.880]   from Kyle Hunt Fitness.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.240]   He sent me a note and said,
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.800]   we'll get you the SARS guard status.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.680]   We can do it for you.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.560]   - Is he in the area?
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.840]   - No, I think he was just joking around.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.600]   - Oh. - But interesting account.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.760]   All right, let's talk about a couple ads.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.200]   Then I have a couple more questions I wanna get to.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.720]   All right, so speaking about health,
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.880]   let's not forget NAD plus supplementation.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.920]   That should be an important part of any health routine
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.480]   as you age.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.880]   Basis by Elysium Health is the most trusted source
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.400]   for NAD plus supplementation.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.400]   Their product basis is clinically proven
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   to increase levels of NAD plus by 40% safely
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.920]   and sustainably.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.880]   That should be our thing, Jesse.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.680]   So there's already podcasters who are jacked.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.000]   We'll be the people who bring in the necessity
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.520]   of NAD plus supplementation for crushing it
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.080]   in podcasting in your 40s, as we're both about to be.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.280]   All right, so if you are interested
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.600]   in NAD plus supplementation,
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.000]   Elysium is where you need to look.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.680]   Their basis product is what you need to look at.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.400]   They product their,
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.200]   Elysium products target aging at its source.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.880]   They are unlike any other health company I've seen
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.520]   in the sense that they are at the forefront
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.560]   of NAD plus supplementation.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.120]   You look at the scientists involved in this company,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.200]   it's very impressive.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.320]   You would think it's like a university science department
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.400]   or something like that.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.200]   And if you don't know about NAD plus,
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.680]   here's my non-expert summary.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.360]   It's found in every single cell of your body.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.000]   It's responsible for creating energy
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.200]   and regulating hundreds of cell functions,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.640]   but it is something that declines as you age.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.480]   Lack of sleep, intense exercise, an unbalanced diet,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.640]   sun overexposure, these can also deplete NAD plus levels.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.400]   Decreased NAD plus levels are linked
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.680]   to faster biological aging,
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.000]   can slow down vital bodily functions.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.520]   That's why this basis product is important.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.920]   It replenishes youthful levels of NAD plus
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.980]   to promote healthy aging,
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.120]   support cellular energy and metabolism
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.500]   and reduce general tiredness.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.560]   All right, so you can get up to youthful levels of NAD plus
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.240]   up to 40% increases safely and sustainably.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.240]   So go to trybasis.com/cal

[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.900]   Thank you to Elysium Health for sponsoring this episode.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:57.080]   All right, well, let's also talk about Z-biotics.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.760]   Rarely have I been more excited about road testing
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.760]   a potential sponsor's product than I was with Z-biotics.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.760]   Let me explain to you what this is.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.600]   Z-biotics, pre-alcohol probiotic
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.280]   is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.920]   It was invented by PhD scientists
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.200]   to tackle rough mornings after drinking.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.920]   Here's how it works.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.740]   When you drink alcohol,
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.800]   it gets converted into a toxic by-product in the gut.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.980]   It's this by-product, not dehydration.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:36.720]   That's the blame for your rough next day.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.560]   Z-biotics produces an enzyme to break it down.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.720]   It's designed to work like your liver,
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.400]   but in your gut where you need it most.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.200]   So when you have that night out with your buddies coming up,
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.280]   when you have that wedding looming,
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.900]   I just got back from a wedding myself
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.840]   just a couple of weeks ago,
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.700]   and you know, gonna have some drinks.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.000]   Might be a bit of a late night,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.320]   but you still have a full day the next day.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.640]   You still need to go do your Alexander Sarsgaard workout.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.120]   You still need to do your deep work.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.560]   You got a full day and you're not 21 years old anymore.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.960]   You're not 24 years old anymore
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.520]   where you can just roll out of bed.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.740]   That's where you throw some Z-biotics into your routine.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.640]   You take some, prophylactically helps break down
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.600]   that harmful by-product the next morning is less rough.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.520]   I have tried this out.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.440]   I had explained stoically to my wife,
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.640]   "No, no, no, I need, I'm drinking this beer
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.080]   as part of the sponsorship investigation for my podcast.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.940]   This is a professional justification
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.200]   for what I'm doing here."
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.920]   Which she bought, though she's confused
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.640]   why I have to test out the sponsorship
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.080]   five days a week for the last six months.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.160]   But you know, you wanna be thorough.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.480]   Now, but anyways, it works.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:01.320]   You take this, help make that next morning
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.400]   just a little bit less rough.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.480]   Not a cool idea.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.940]   So give Z-biotics a try for yourself.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:10.840]   Go to zbiotics.com/cal to get 15% off your first order
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.200]   when you use that code CAL at checkout.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.840]   Z-biotics is based, or is backed, I should say,
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.360]   with 100% money back guarantee.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.320]   So if you're unsatisfied for any reason,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.500]   they'll refund your money, no questions asked.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:29.360]   Should note that July 4th is right around the corner.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.280]   So you might wanna order a pack of Z-biotics now
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.120]   for you and your friends,
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.560]   just to make sure you get it in time
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.660]   in case you plan on really getting after it
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:42.120]   when it comes to celebrating the birth of the nation.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.600]   So remember, head to zbiotics.com/cal
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.800]   and use that code CAL at checkout for 15% off.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.040]   Science can do anything these days, Jesse.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.760]   - Yep.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.640]   - All right, let's see.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.600]   Let's do a couple more.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.440]   Where are we?
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.720]   Ooh, kinda doing a long one today, but feeling feisty.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.760]   So let's do a couple other questions.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.600]   We'll do them quick.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.240]   We've got a question here from Sam.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.720]   By the way, it's a running joke with me and Jesse.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:12.000]   Me saying let's do this one quick is a complete no-op.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.880]   It has no impact or influence
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.520]   on how long it takes me to answer the next question.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.040]   I just say it aspirationally.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.920]   But maybe this time I'll actually do it.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.640]   All right, Sam asks,
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.480]   "Is there a way to minimize cognitive residue
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.280]   "after switching from one time block to another?
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.960]   "I find it wasteful to have a 15-minute blank
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.920]   "supposedly required to get out of cognitive revenue
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.040]   "when switching between tasks.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.960]   "I'm wondering whether there's a way to minimize it."
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.440]   I mean, yes and no, Sam.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.440]   Attention residue is a real thing.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.600]   If you've been working on this,
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.840]   now you switch to that,
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.960]   it's gonna take a little while
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.400]   until you can be completely up to speed on that.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.680]   The neural configuration that got fired up
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:59.680]   for the first thing you're doing can't change on time.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.240]   You have to inhibit networks,
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.240]   you have to amplify other networks.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.440]   It does take some time.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.280]   If you're working on non-demanding tasks,
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.320]   then you're basically just powering through that residue.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.400]   You just sort of understand
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:15.120]   if you're cleaning out your email inbox
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.440]   or trying to batch together 10 unrelated tasks
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.240]   that you wanna get done right after another,
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.400]   you're just gonna be functioning at a reduced capacity
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.760]   because you're gonna constantly have residue.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.280]   But if it's not demanding, just be okay.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.640]   It's gonna feel a little bit harder.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.960]   It's gonna be a little bit more frustrating
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.640]   than you might like.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:34.480]   But that's just the reality of attention residue.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.320]   Couple of things that help with non-demanding tasks,
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.040]   batch like tasks together.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.840]   If you have four scheduling things,
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.360]   do four scheduling things in a row.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.600]   So you're trying to minimize context shifts.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.200]   I'll do this with emails.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.040]   I'm cleaning my inbox.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.880]   I'll actually make a transcript
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:56.200]   in my working memory.txt plain text file
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.960]   of the messages that I need to answer.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960]   Type out little summaries, a couple words,
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.280]   description of each of these messages I need to answer.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.800]   And then I'll move them around in the text file
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.480]   to cluster them together.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.040]   So like questions are together,
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.220]   similar emails are together.
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.620]   And then I answer the emails in that order
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.100]   just to try to reduce to some degree
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:23.100]   the negative impact of that context switching.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.020]   When it comes to demanding task,
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.940]   you're working on something deep
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.380]   and you need to move over to something else deep.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.580]   Yeah, it's gonna take 15 minutes
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.700]   for you to get up and going.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.860]   One thing I sometimes suggest
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.820]   is when you finish deep project A,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:39.780]   immediately get everything set up for the next deep project,
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.500]   load up the files, go to the right software,
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.100]   gather what you need.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:47.180]   So it's there and then go and take 10 minutes
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:49.820]   to go get coffee or go for a walk,
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.960]   just to give your mind time
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.480]   to clear out what it was doing before.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.900]   So that when you get back to the next deep task,
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.480]   it's not so frustrating.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.680]   You'll be able to get up and going.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.780]   Now it doesn't save you time
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:03.060]   and it says you're taking a 10 minute break,
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.260]   but I'd rather be clearing my head on a 10 minute walk
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.960]   than I would be trying to work for 10 minutes
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.660]   and find it very frustrating.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.540]   'Cause if that 10 minutes you find it very frustrating,
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.520]   you are way more likely to give up.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.240]   And be like, I'm just not in the mood to do this
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.400]   and start checking email.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.720]   So that's my tip for dealing with the residue
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.980]   as you switch between one deep endeavor to another.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:26.040]   All right, Jesse, let's do one more call
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:26.880]   before we call it quits.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   I think we have one more call in our queue here.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.840]   Okay, we've got a great accent here.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.140]   Ooh, I love great accents.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.320]   - Hi Cal, it's David here
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:42.000]   in overcast cloudy Falkirk in central Scotland.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.600]   I was pleased to hear your announcement
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.640]   in episode 197 of your upcoming books
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.920]   on the deep life and slow productivity.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.620]   You made the observation that this is the first book deal
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.920]   that you've signed since the deep questions podcast began.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.120]   And I'm sure that the regular listeners will be excited
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.660]   to hear your updates as writing progresses.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.840]   But it sparked a question for me.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.040]   How has the podcast itself influenced your thinking
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.200]   and therefore your writing choices?
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.120]   Now, you're clearly responding to trends and forces
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.240]   that predated 2020 and that were then exacerbated
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:20.780]   by an explosion of remote work and digital communication.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.560]   And your work has always involved
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.240]   interviewing interesting people
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.120]   and interacting with groups
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:30.240]   and answering questions when giving talks.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.480]   But if the medium really is the message,
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.940]   has your thinking been pushed in new directions
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.360]   by immersing yourself in the medium of podcasting?
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.380]   Or do you think that you would have pitched book proposals
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.420]   at this point in time with roughly the same subjects,
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.280]   even if you hadn't started the podcast?
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.940]   I'm enjoying the show as ever,
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:53.740]   and I look forward to reading the new books.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.140]   - Well, David, it's a good question.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.800]   I don't really know the answer to that counterfactual.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   I mean, I can give you the conceptual history
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.220]   of the deep life.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:09.280]   So that topic, if you trace it back,
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.180]   that actually got introduced on my blog and email newsletter
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:15.980]   at calnewport.com in the first two months
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.660]   after March of 2020.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.540]   So early in the pandemic, I did a lot of writing.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:24.260]   I spent the month where I said I would write every day
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:26.380]   because I had a lot of extra intellectual energy
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.100]   and it just seemed like something to do.
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.980]   And so I was in a hyper receptive mode
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.420]   and it was actually pretty early on.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.260]   This might've been March or April of 2020
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.860]   is where I landed on the concept of the deep life.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.300]   I was just sensing that in my own life
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.780]   and I was sensing that from the messages
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:41.860]   I was getting from readers,
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.940]   that there's this big disruption that had occurred
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.420]   and it was causing people to rethink,
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.740]   what am I doing with my life,
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.000]   especially for knowledge workers
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.100]   that were home with their kids and working remotely
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.320]   and like, what are we doing here?
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.500]   And I just felt that energy
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:57.900]   and I began to explore it for sure in my writing.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:01.200]   And the podcast started up in May, May, 2020.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.220]   And in the very first episode,
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.340]   I was doing questions on the deep life.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.220]   And then I think I broke it up into work technology
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:11.700]   and the deep life right from the beginning.
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.260]   Those are my initial three categories.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.360]   So by the time I got to the podcast in May,
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.580]   I knew that was gonna be a major topic
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.260]   I was going to explore.
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.860]   And so the role of the podcast played
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:25.000]   is it really gave me a way to work with
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.860]   and play with that topic,
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.220]   probably at a faster rate than I could do just with writing.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.600]   I think answering four or five questions a week
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.880]   allowed me to cover a lot more ground than one essay a week,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.340]   especially when only some weeks
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.980]   would be dedicated to that topic.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:45.960]   So I thought about the deep life before the podcast.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.340]   I would have almost certainly still developed that concept
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:49.860]   and written about it without the podcast,
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:52.140]   but the podcast greatly accelerated
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.900]   the rate at which I could explore
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.680]   and push on the nooks and the crannies
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.160]   and find the contours and really start to evolve
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.200]   and figure this out.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.880]   I think all the feedback I got from listeners, questions,
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.680]   what are they asking about, I would give an answer,
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.560]   what would they cue into,
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.000]   then what would I talk about the next episode?
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   I think a lot of that probably really accelerated
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.680]   the evolution of the concept
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.960]   and probably gave me a richer understanding of that concept
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.840]   than I would have had just writing.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.000]   So definitely the podcast took what I had long been doing
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.520]   with my email newsletter,
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.840]   which was exploring ideas and getting feedback on ideas
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.880]   at a faster rate than I could just do books.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.020]   And I think it pushed that even farther.
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.800]   I could explore ideas even more, even get more feedback.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.080]   I think the same thing happened with slow productivity.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.020]   I introduced it in a blog post.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.920]   So I often develop ideas in blog posts,
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.640]   but pretty quickly began talking about it on the podcast.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.020]   Also, I began talking about it in podcast interviews
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.840]   with other people.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.340]   I talked about it with Tim Ferriss
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.920]   and among some other interviews I did.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.480]   And that really helped it develop.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.320]   Then I wrote a New Yorker article about it.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.340]   That really forced me to really think it through.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.140]   And so again, I think sometimes
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:09.800]   that slow productivity is similar to deep life.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.600]   I introduced the idea in my writing,
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.760]   I rapidly developed it in this medium,
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.620]   and then it's coming back into the world of writing
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:20.500]   where I can ultimately be the most nuanced about it.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:25.500]   So yeah, I think the podcast has been useful in my ideation.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.700]   It did not fundamentally change how that happens,
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:31.380]   but it definitely changed the rate and magnitude
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:34.620]   at which I can work through concepts.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.860]   Also, it's a lot of fun.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.700]   So anyways, David, I appreciate the question.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.800]   I love the accent too.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.140]   I won't try that one.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.400]   I have a great French accent, everyone agrees.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.940]   I'm not gonna try the Scottish.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.340]   We will lose all of our Scottish listeners.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.420]   - I'm going to Scotland in August.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.500]   - You're gonna play golf?
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.380]   - Yeah. - Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.820]   That's a cool trip.
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:58.900]   - I've been there before, sweet place.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:01.180]   - It's a different type of golf, right?
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.900]   - Yeah, I've been there.
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.740]   This will be my fourth time there.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:08.260]   - So are we gonna broadcast deep questions from Scotland?
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.500]   Is that the idea?
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.100]   - Yeah, actually I remember vividly,
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.980]   I was on a jog there before a round and like on the beach,
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.660]   and that's when you interviewed your buddy
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.500]   who does the Zytel Massa.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.340]   - Oh yeah.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.540]   - I remember that so vividly.
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.180]   - Yeah, Srini.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.720]   Yeah, he was here, came to the studio.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.980]   Yeah, it was fun.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.580]   All right, well, you've heard it here first.
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.660]   We will be broadcasting from Scotland
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.500]   in extensive Scottish studios.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.660]   I will be back, I mean, at some point I will be back there.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.340]   It's in my contract now.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:39.460]   I don't know if I mentioned it last time,
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.740]   but the contract I signed with Little Brown in the UK
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.260]   for the new books,
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:48.640]   the contract includes I have to come to the UK.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.020]   - You should go to St. Andrews in town.
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:50.980]   It's such a cool town.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:52.180]   - I would, I would like to go.
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.740]   I have a guest bartending job there
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:56.060]   when I go over there, that's true.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.620]   - Who has the best, Neil Gaiman,
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:00.260]   the writer Neil Gaiman,
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:03.740]   he bought a property on the Island of Skye.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:06.380]   So it's one of these like Scottish islands.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.500]   It looks like one of his books, like a fairy tale land.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.740]   And he has a, I don't know what you call it over there,
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.580]   but like a rolling hills and a house.
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.300]   And I admire that.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.140]   - Yeah.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.420]   - Yeah, that's a good use of resources.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.380]   Not like Neil Gaiman is, I think he's Dan Brown.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:23.220]   I mean, it's not like, okay,
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:25.500]   here's your $50 million a year in earnings.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.900]   Like he's a more eccentric, esoteric, brilliant guy.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:31.140]   He does comic books and novels
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.020]   and all sorts of different things.
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.300]   I mean, I think he does well.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.220]   It's like he's rolling in money.
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:37.460]   So I think it's a good strategic investment for him
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.420]   to have a land on the Isle of Skye.
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:43.420]   It looks like a place where fairies live
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.040]   and that's gotta be so well-suited
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.100]   for the type of work he does.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.180]   - So golf memberships are cheap over there too.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.900]   So you can get into golf.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:51.740]   - So what I'll do.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:52.560]   All right.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.400]   So I'm gonna buy an island,
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.420]   an estate on an island in Scotland and play a lot of golf.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.260]   - Sounds good.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.020]   - All right, I bought it.
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.300]   Until then though,
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.540]   thank you everyone for listening to this episode.
