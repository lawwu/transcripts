[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.780]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.440]   with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.520]   to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.980]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.360]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.660]   Today, I have a simple encouragement for you.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.960]   I want to encourage you to put numbers to your goals.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.360]   Think about what some goals or dreams are that you have
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.840]   and sit down and put some numbers to your goals.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.640]   And I think if you'll do that, you'll be able to see ways
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.880]   of achieving certain goals that probably previously seemed totally out of sight.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640]   I was reminded of this truth yesterday.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.740]   I was sitting down and thinking about some things,
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.260]   and I just decided to start putting some numbers down on paper.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.860]   And I was really shocked with how it transformed my perspective.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.260]   I'll share the example specifically.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.120]   I'm traveling right now, currently in Bogota, Colombia.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.360]   And as I was traveling, I was thinking about traveling.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.140]   And when you think about traveling, I'm attracted often to people who who
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.900]   well, I'm attracted to the idea of setting and achieving big goals.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.740]   I like to do things that other people, not very many people have done.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.320]   And one of the things that I have often thought about doing in my life
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.040]   is traveling to every country in the world.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.420]   I've been interested in this for over a decade,
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.960]   reading about people who've accomplished this goal, just kind of interested in it.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.020]   Never really said it as something that I really want to do, but interested in it.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.960]   So recently I was watching
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   some YouTube videos from a young lady named Alexis.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.140]   She has a YouTube channel called Lexi Limitless or Limitless Lexi, one of the two.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940]   And Alexis is the youngest person
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.140]   to have ever traveled to all of the countries in the world.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.780]   She did it when she was 20, by the time she was 21 years old.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.920]   And I was thinking about my traveling and I was thinking about my children.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.560]   I thought, I wonder if I could take my children to every country in the world
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220]   and have them break the Guinness Book of World Records
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.700]   for the youngest person to travel in the world.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.800]   I've got four children, ages one, three, five and seven.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.900]   And as I was thinking about it, I thought, well, I could,
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   I could, my one year old start, you know, start traveling.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.580]   And by what age could my one year old break that, break that travel record?
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.940]   And I, again, I'm not saying that I want to do it.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.120]   There are a lot of downsides to doing something like that.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.580]   I've never committed to this as, ah, this I want to do.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.960]   I just admire it when people set big goals.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.220]   It's tough.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.320]   The idea of traveling to every country in the world is tough.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.560]   But what keeps people back from doing something like that?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.900]   Some people like me would think about it and say, but do I really want to?
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.100]   Right. Is that really useful and valuable?
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.940]   Let's say that I did choose to take my children to every country in the world.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.040]   Well, what kind of time commitment would that be?
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.400]   What kind of things would you give up?
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.800]   You would give up a lot of of experiences.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.940]   You would give up a lot of of experiences of of kind of normal day
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.040]   to day life and of local social,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.620]   so social networks and things like that.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.880]   You would gain other experiences and maybe that would be superior.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.160]   I'm not so sure.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.060]   But along the way, of course, you would quickly come to money
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.300]   and you would say, well, how can I afford to travel to every country in the world?
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.460]   How can I how could I do that?
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.940]   And here's where putting numbers to paper is, I think, incredibly free.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.400]   And let me give you the numbers that I put down as I was thinking about
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.900]   what it would cost if I actually did set a goal like I'm going to travel
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.080]   and take my children to every country in the world.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.180]   Travel, there are lots of people who travel
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.120]   and those people usually track their expenses.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.520]   And so I there's another travel blogger that I have watched
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.260]   over the years named Drew Binsky.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.280]   Drew has traveled to every country in the world.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.420]   He's made videos, daily videos about his work.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.300]   Drew says that it costs him seven hundred dollars per country to travel,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.800]   and he's tracked all the expenses along the way.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.300]   Drew's an American citizen.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.340]   So, of course, he has fewer visa expenses,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.040]   but his seven hundred dollar per country ticket or number includes everything.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.280]   It includes visa expenses, includes transportation to and from the country.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.480]   It includes lodging and accommodations while in the country and tours
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.620]   and things like that.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.580]   So his number is seven hundred dollars.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.260]   And I think that that's probably a pretty accurate number.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.620]   Some countries are very expensive.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.720]   Some countries are very inexpensive, but it all evens out in the long run.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.060]   So let's say you do seven hundred dollars.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.760]   So I sat down and I said, OK, seven hundred dollars per country.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.140]   Now I lead a family of six.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.840]   So seven hundred times six.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.480]   Let's assume that there's no cost savings involved with traveling with family.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.420]   There are some certainly some cost savings.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.380]   You might have fewer hotel rooms.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.160]   You don't necessarily have to have six hotel rooms and and transportation
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.220]   might in some cases be less.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.800]   But let's assume there's not cost savings.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.000]   So seven hundred dollars per country times six people equals four thousand
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.500]   two hundred dollars per country.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.560]   So that's what it would cost me for me to take my family
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.940]   of six to each country in the world.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.300]   And to me, that feels just about right.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.840]   Four thousand two hundred dollars per country
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.140]   based on my experience traveling to a few dozen countries.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.380]   Then how many countries are there?
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.840]   Well, the numbers vary.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.640]   There's one hundred ninety three UN countries.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.380]   There's a couple of disputed territories like Taiwan, et cetera.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.080]   So a good number is about one hundred ninety five.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.360]   And then some people go to two hundred.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.420]   But let's just say let's use one hundred ninety five.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.420]   So four thousand two hundred times one hundred ninety five
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.100]   equals eight hundred nineteen thousand dollars.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.400]   So let's say that I did set a goal of taking my children
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040]   to every country in the world.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.180]   My budget for that would be something like eight hundred nineteen thousand dollars.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.180]   So let's call it 800 grand, maybe 900, who knows?
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.120]   Now, in some ways, that's a big number, but in some ways
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.640]   it's not that big of a number.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.380]   So let's add one more adjustment to change the number.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.580]   How long would it take me to travel to every country in the world?
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.340]   Who knows? Right.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.380]   There are people who have done it in a year and a little under two years.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.180]   That's under the Guinness Book of World Records.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.380]   I would not want to travel that way and definitely not with children.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.920]   I would want to travel much more slowly.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.320]   You figure if there are one hundred ninety five countries
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.460]   that you're traveling to, if you did it in ten years,
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.860]   that would be nineteen and a half countries per year.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.960]   That's pretty fast.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.220]   Now, in some cases, that's easy.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.400]   Some places that's easy.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.420]   Some places that's not.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.720]   And that's where you start to think about, well, what style of travel
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.860]   would I be engaging in?
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.940]   Would I want to spend a month in each country?
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.000]   Well, if you had a month in each country, then that would be one hundred ninety five.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.240]   So if you did that as one hundred ninety five countries per year,
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.140]   then that would be sixteen point two five years.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.980]   Well, here's what's interesting.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.540]   Let's say you did do it in sixteen point two five years.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.680]   Let's call it sixteen years.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.380]   Eight hundred nineteen thousand dollars
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.220]   divided by sixteen years is an annual budget of fifty one thousand dollars.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.420]   Eight hundred and ten thousand dollars divided by sixteen years
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.560]   is an annual budget of my calculator is not working.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.600]   Basically, fifty one thousand dollars.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.140]   Quick sidebar, once you learn reverse Polish notation,
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.300]   you can't ever get your other calculators to work quite right.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.140]   So I've used I use reverse Polish notation for years.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.500]   And now when I go to pick up the calculator on my iPhone,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.840]   it just doesn't work quite right for me.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.580]   So let's call it fifty two thousand dollars a year.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.680]   All of a sudden, now that big, hairy, audacious goal
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.660]   doesn't seem quite so overwhelming.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:56.020]   Fifty two thousand dollars a year to travel to one country per month.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.560]   That's pretty doable.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.220]   And all of a sudden you realize that, wait a second,
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.400]   I'm already spending fifty two thousand dollars a year.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.960]   And you realize that there are thousands and hundreds of thousands of people
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.300]   all around the world who make their living through an Internet connection
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   and earn more than fifty two thousand dollars per year.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.380]   And now you don't all of a sudden have to have a million dollar fortune
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.740]   that you're going to systematically spend over the next sixteen years.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.980]   You just need to earn fifty two thousand dollars a year
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.340]   and you could accomplish a goal like that.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.640]   I find that amazingly freeing,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.280]   amazingly freeing, where you take this big, scary goal
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.640]   take I'm going to take my kids to every country in the world
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.380]   and you start calculating the budget on it and you figure out,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.360]   well, all I got to do is earn fifty two thousand dollars a year
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.500]   and I could cover my expenses enough to travel to one new country every month,
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.700]   twelve countries a year.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.960]   And over the next sixteen years, I could travel to all these countries.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.300]   That's awesome.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.480]   To repeat, I'm not setting this as a goal.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   I'm not. I don't think I want to do it.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.180]   I don't think that's the lifestyle I want to live.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.680]   I don't think that that's what I want to do with my children.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.420]   It's not a personal goal of mine.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.160]   I think there are other non-financial reasons why I don't want to do it.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:29.140]   But it's really nice to know that when you actually start digging out numbers,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.440]   most goals, most goals that you and I have,
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.180]   even the big, scary ones are really eminently achievable.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.980]   So I encourage you, if there's a goal that you've been thinking about doing,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.460]   get out a calculator and a sheet of paper and start working the actual numbers
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.020]   and figure out what would that actually cost me.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.760]   Might be a lifestyle goal.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.060]   What would it actually cost me to go here to do that?
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.860]   What would it actually cost me to buy this or to engage in this other thing,
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.440]   to start practicing this certain thing I want to do, this hobby, this skill,
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.900]   to add in this certain sport?
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.800]   What would it actually cost me?
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.140]   And then break it down into a budget amount that makes sense.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.180]   And you may find that your goals are still big,
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.780]   they're still hard to achieve, in which case you need a better engine.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.420]   But you may find that they're eminently achievable and relatively easy to do,
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.100]   in which case you can move past worrying about the money
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.500]   and you can think about the other things.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.940]   I'm not scared of the financial cost of a goal like,
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.240]   I'm going to take my children to every country in the world.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.180]   Because I've done the math and it doesn't actually cost all that much,
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.280]   even for you as an individual.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.720]   If we use Drew's number, $700 per country times $195, that's a $136,000 goal.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.880]   Right? If you wanted to travel every country in the world,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.520]   it would cost you a hundred and something thousand dollars.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.260]   You could do it cheaper, stay in fancier places, maybe it's $200,000.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.500]   Not that much money in the grand scheme of things.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:19.900]   So now, once you're free of the financial stress,
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.100]   you can move on to thinking about the other things and deciding,
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.040]   is this really a good idea? Is this really something I want to do or not?
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.020]   Hope that helps you. Have a great day.
