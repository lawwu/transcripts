[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   Tenniel writes in to ask this, "Romans 12, 2 says, 'Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.700]   but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.760]   is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.'"
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.680]   Pastor John, what does it mean when it says "by testing"?
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.400]   That is a really, really good question.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.360]   I love it because it means she's really paying attention.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.200]   She's looking at the book and she cares about the words.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.400]   And oh, I love people who care about the words of Scripture.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.800]   And that phrase, she's obviously reading from the ESV, I think, because it's translated
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.680]   differently in different ways.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.240]   Let me just give it again so that the listeners can get it before their mind.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.820]   "Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.440]   that by testing you may discern the will of God."
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.160]   Now that phrase, "by testing you may discern," is the translation of one Greek word, dokim
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160]   mazo.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.920]   The standard lexical definition goes like this, "to make a critical examination of something
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.420]   to determine genuineness, such as metals by fire."
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.800]   And interestingly, it's used in 1 Corinthians 3:13 where it says, "fire will test"—that's
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.920]   the word, dokim mazo—"will test what sort of work each one has done."
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.480]   So our works at the last day are going to be tested by fire.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.040]   So the idea is that the genuineness of something, in this case the will of God in Romans 12:2,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.900]   the genuineness of something is found out by an appropriate test.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.360]   For metals, it is often fire.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.060]   For genuine ripeness in fruit, it would be like tasting.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.640]   And for genuine health in a horse, you might look at his teeth.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.500]   And here, interestingly, powerfully, in verse 2 of Romans 12, the thing to be recognized
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.440]   is the will of God, namely what's good and acceptable and perfect.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.300]   And the question is, so what's the test?
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.360]   You look at the teeth of the will of God, or you put your tongue on the behavior you're
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.900]   testing?
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.020]   Do you put some match to it?
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.740]   What is the test?
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.200]   And Paul answers, "the renewal of your mind is the test."
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.160]   By the renewal of your mind, you will be able to discern by testing what is the will of
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   God.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.660]   So here's the picture I have in my mind.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.380]   My renewed mind, renewed by the Word of God, renewed by the Spirit of God, renewed by soaking
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:10.700]   in the revealed nature of God in Scripture, is litmus paper which turns green when the
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.340]   good and acceptable and perfect will touches it.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.620]   Green, go!
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.980]   Go for that!
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.700]   And it turns red when it considers some act which is not the will of God.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   It's not good.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.700]   It's not acceptable.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.060]   It's not perfect.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:38.500]   So my mind is being shaped by God into the kind of mind that when it contemplates a behavior
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.100]   or an attitude or a word, there's something that reflexively says no or yes to it because
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.100]   of the way our mind has been formed.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.020]   And here's a great example that shows you how the mind is being renewed for this very
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.020]   purpose.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.140]   It's in Romans 1.9 where Paul's praying that this would happen.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.700]   He prays like this, "It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:18.300]   and insight so that you may prove"—now there's the word—"approve what is excellent."
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.760]   So he's saying what happens to your love is that love gets more knowledge in Scripture
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.220]   and love gets more insight in Scripture and love gets more of everything it needs to be
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.540]   the kind of litmus paper it needs to be so that when you're out there in the world
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.300]   and you're navigating at work every day and you don't have your little lists in your
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.740]   pocket to say, "Oh, where's a list I can consult?"
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.460]   Well, you can't consult a list for every decision you have to make.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.820]   I would say 90% of the decisions we make through the day don't have a list that applies
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.820]   to them.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.280]   We've got to make judgment calls over and over again as to what is good, what is acceptable,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.440]   what is perfect, and that's why our minds are being renewed day by day.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.700]   And let me say one more thing that I think is crucial here.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:15.040]   The translation "discern by testing" might give the impression that all that's
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.480]   implied is, "Well, you test, you discern, and you know that's the will of God.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.280]   You don't like it, but you do it anyway."
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   That's not what's going on.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.440]   The word "documazo" doesn't just mean "prove and discern."
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.280]   It means "prove and then when something is found to be genuine, approve, approve of it."
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.880]   We know that because in Romans 1:28 it says, "The sinners did not approve to have God
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   in their knowledge."
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   And that's the word, "documazo."
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.800]   They didn't want it.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.400]   They didn't love it.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.520]   And so the renewed mind is the mind that not only has the mental or intellectual or knowledge
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.480]   or insight capacities to discern something that's good and acceptable and perfect, but
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:13.880]   it also has the spiritual taste so that when something is seen to be of God, it tastes
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.960]   good to us.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   We delight in it.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.360]   We approve of it.
