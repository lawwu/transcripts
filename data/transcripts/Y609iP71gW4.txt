[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   something can be not godlike, and still more powerful than you.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.000]   Like you look at the world chess champion Magnus Carlsen, who by objective, by which I mean AI
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.720]   measurements, is probably the strongest human player who ever lived. He's not god. He's not
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.640]   infinitely smart. He starts off on a chessboard with no more resources than you have, and he
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.120]   predictably wipes the board with you, because he doesn't have to be godlike to defeat you,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.880]   or me, to be clear. I also can be defeated by being short of godhood.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.600]   Magnus Carlsen can't make diamond nanobots. Do we agree on that statement?
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.400]   Not quickly. I'm not sure what happens if you give him a million years to work on it.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.600]   Then I'm not sure what happens. I agree that he probably can't do it quickly.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.360]   Okay.
