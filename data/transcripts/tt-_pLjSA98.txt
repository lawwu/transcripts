[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   This is Westminster Chapel in the heart of central London, where my grandfather, Dr.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.000]   Martin Lloyd-Jones, preached for 30 years before stepping down from the pulpit in 1968.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.720]   The church held about 2,000 people, and he preached morning and evening, and on Friday
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.860]   evenings going through major series such as Ephesians and Romans and Acts and the Gospel
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.640]   of John. After stepping down from the pulpit in 1968, he remained active through to his
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.100]   death in 1981. But in the early years of his retirement, 1969 to 1971, he did a series
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.980]   of television interviews. Alas, we don't have all of those interviews, but thanks to the
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.740]   permission of the broadcaster, we do have two, and they're on our YouTube site. This
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.240]   one is with the Welsh broadcaster, writer, and researcher, Anirin Talvin-Davies. We do
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.600]   hope you enjoy it.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.400]   Now, Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, you've been about 40 years in the ministry, and before that,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.000]   you were a physician on the threshold of a very successful career. Now, what made you
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   change course?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.200]   Well, of course, that's a question one can't answer in a few words. It was nothing sudden
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.000]   or dramatic. It was a process which went on really for several years, but particularly
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.600]   for the last 18 months before I left medicine and became a minister of the gospel.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.600]   What do you believe would make a successful preacher? Had you those qualities? Did you
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.880]   feel in yourself that you had the qualities that would make a successful preacher?
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.000]   I really was never concerned about that. My concern was with what needed to be preached,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.480]   and it was this burning conviction as to the message needed that drove me on. I've sometimes
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.960]   told people of a story which will help to answer your question, how having taken my
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   decision to go into the church and to preach. Someone very near to me was walking with me
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.680]   one night and asked me the question, "How would you know that you'd be able to preach?
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.640]   You know what you can do as a doctor. Why not go on with it and exercise Christian influence?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.160]   What if you find suddenly that you can't preach?" Well, I'd only tried preaching about three
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.080]   times in very small places, and the only answer I could give was this. I know what I want
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760]   to preach and what I think must be preached, and I have a feeling somehow that I'll be
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.880]   able to say it.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   Did anything happen during your childhood days which predisposed you towards a career
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   in the ministry?
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.240]   Well, the one big thing, of course, was that I very nearly lost my life at the age of 10.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   Our home somehow or other went on fire, and my brother and myself and my father, my mother
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.440]   was away from home. We very nearly lost our lives in the fire. We'd just escaped. And
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.880]   I, ever since then, had some peculiar feeling and sensation that I was called to do something
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.880]   in this world with respect to mankind. I'll put it as generally as that. It first came
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   to me in the form of medicine, and then, as I said, it turned to the other.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.360]   Now, your father, I understand, was a radical. He was a follower of Argyle Campbell and a
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.800]   politician. Now, what-- it seems to me that there's been a reaction against this in your
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   life. He was against the piety of Methodism, for instance. Now, would you say that you've
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.920]   reacted violently against your father's views?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.760]   No, far from it. My father's influence on me was one of the greatest of all because
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   of his sincerity and his honesty. Now, what he reacted against, I was reacted against,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:50.400]   was the degeneration of true Methodism by our time, the fire at gun. And it wasn't a
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.120]   true Puritanism. It was a false Puritanism. It was a preaching of morality without any
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.520]   gospel. And, of course, he reacted also against the popular preaching. And I've always reacted
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   against it, the mechanical popular preaching, what was the old Welsh hoil, which I think
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.240]   was put on generally. Now, he reacted against that. So did I. But we've reacted in different
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.840]   ways only in this sense, that he turned to people like Argyle Campbell and the then new
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.440]   theology. And I turned back to the message that was preached by the Methodist fathers
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.080]   in which I maintain is the message of the church throughout the centuries.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.360]   It's a coincidence, perhaps, but when the booklet called The Fundamentals, I think,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.000]   which gave the name fundamentalist to that group who believe in that way, there's a coincidence
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.280]   that among them that were in the first booklet published, Dr. Campbell Morgan, and also a
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.160]   man described as an eminent physician. Now, are you a fundamentalist?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, I, like many others, I don't like the term. I prefer to call myself a conservative
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   evangelical. That is very largely because of the abuse of the term, I think, in the
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.760]   United States. But I am a conservative evangelical, as Dr. Campbell Morgan himself was, and as
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.080]   most of those men who wrote the contributions to that symposium you're talking about were.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.320]   What would you say the difference between yourself and the people who call themselves
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.280]   fundamentalists is?
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.080]   Well, one doesn't want to be offensive, but I think our attitude is a little more intelligent.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.240]   I mean, I have very little sympathy with a man who just holds up a Bible and says, "I
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.600]   believe this," from cover to cover, every comma and full stop, and all the rest of it.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:51.160]   There's been a little bit too much of that, and a refusal to use one's mind and to recognize
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.400]   figures of speech and so on. I think their danger has been to be literalistic in a wrong
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.800]   sense. That would be the main difference, I think, between us.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.000]   One thing that's impressed me about Westminster Chapel, the services there, when I've attended,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.360]   is the, first of all, the amazing number of young people you have, and that they are also
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.240]   there with their Bibles in their hands. And as you preach, so they turn the leaves of
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.440]   the Bible and follow you. And it seems that your style is different in many ways from
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.480]   the style of the preachers we heard in Wales in the beginning of this century. Now, what
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.720]   do you think is the attraction for these young people in your preaching?
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   Well, I would say that what appeals to them is the note of authority, and that isn't anything
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:51.960]   in me. It's that I am an expositor of the Scriptures. I don't believe it's the preacher's
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.800]   function to stand up and voice his own opinions and theories and ideas, but to expound and
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.520]   to bring out the message of the Bible. And I think it's this, and one does this in as
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.280]   reasoning and as logical a manner as one can to show the inevitability of the conclusion.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.680]   I think that young people today are looking for authority. They're bewildered and they're
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.480]   confused and they want something certain.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:29.760]   Two trays in the evangelical outlook on religion, it seems to me, are that they tend to lessen
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.740]   the social content of the Gospels. That is, there is a lack of social content and it seems
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:42.220]   to me a refusal to face the modern world with all its problems. And the other one is a kind
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:49.680]   of exclusivity, spiritual exclusivity, which inhibits them from joining with their fellow
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.920]   Christians in action. Now, that's a long question. I'll give you time to reply to it without
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   disturbing you.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.280]   Yes, well, the trouble is you won't give me time. You see, I should need many hours on
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.400]   both the questions, with which I'm very familiar, of course. This is the usual taunt. Now, with
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.760]   regard to your first question, I just dispute that completely. There is all the difference
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.680]   in the world between exercising a political and social influence directly and indirectly.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.200]   I believe the function of the church is to do this indirectly. In other words, it is
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.860]   not the business of the preacher to deal with political and social issues in the pulpit.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.800]   The key is to preach to men and women, lay people, who are to go out into the world to
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.080]   do this. And never have they had a greater need of the spiritual note. The danger is
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.600]   to be materialistic in outlook. Now, and I think this has been true historically, I think
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.520]   I could show very easily that it is the evangelical gospel and its preaching that has had the
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.240]   greatest impact upon this country politically and socially. For instance, hospitals started
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.200]   in this way, education. The main impetus to that was the evangelical awakening of 200
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.680]   years ago. It's agreed that the trade union movement came out of this. But you see, this
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.460]   is indirect. In other words, when you build up a man spiritually and make a true Christian
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.660]   of him, then he develops a social conscience. Whereas these other men were always preaching
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:24.140]   politics and about social conditions. I observe that the main effect they have is to drive
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.100]   their congregations away. Their congregations have become smaller and smaller. And some
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.940]   of them have even had to amalgamate with other churches comparatively recently I've observed
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.220]   with much interest. In other words, they have no impact at all. The main result of a man
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:46.620]   preaching politics to me is that he gets notoriety. But he doesn't affect the situation at all.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.700]   Now, I think this is a very vital point. For instance, you remember there was a time when
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.180]   there was such a thing as the nonconformist conscience. And people had to pay attention
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.540]   to it. Hugh Price Hughes, a Methodist preacher, gave an address on a Sunday afternoon here
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.380]   in London. And Mr. Gladstone had to listen to him and take a particular attitude with
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.860]   regard to Parnell. Why? Not because Hugh Price Hughes was a preacher or a political preacher,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:19.580]   but that Mr. Gladstone knew that the nonconformist conscience, which in turn leads to the nonconformist
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:25.580]   vote, would be against him if he didn't listen. So the main... If I want to influence political
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.820]   social conditions, my best plan of doing so is to produce Christian people in large numbers,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.640]   and then the politicians will pay attention. They don't listen to what the preachers say
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.540]   about political and social issues.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:43.900]   Well, I said I wouldn't, but just to remind ourselves that your first ministry after you
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.500]   left the medical profession was in Port Talbot in a working class neighbourhood.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   Precisely.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.900]   Why was that decision taken?
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.420]   Well I wanted to go there because I wanted to be with people, with the working class
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.300]   people in particular. It seems to me this is the great trouble in the church today,
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.220]   that she's not touching the working classes. I was there amongst them, and the majority
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.440]   of the members of our church were working class men.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.480]   Would these working class men in your chapel in Port Talbot, would they also be enthusiastic
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   trade unionists?
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.160]   Of course they were. They were great politicians. Even the secretary of the church when I went
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:28.840]   there was a great politician. But he came to see that he needed something more. In other
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.040]   words, I saw that the great trouble in Port Talbot was, and remember when I went there,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.240]   the member for that constituency was Mr. Ramsey MacDonald, and they almost worshipped him.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.920]   So my great theme in a sense was, "Put not your faith in princes." And when he formed
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.300]   his coalition government, of course I became a true prophet. I'd always told them not to
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.040]   trust men to this extent. And they were very disillusioned. And it gave me a great opportunity
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.600]   of preaching the gospel. In other words, if you want to deal with social conditions, you've
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:04.900]   got to do it in this indirect manner, through the preaching of the gospel. I think this
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.400]   can be established historically quite clearly. And today, more than ever, I think we need
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.560]   to do this. The state has come in and provision is made for the poor and so on, in a way that
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.800]   wasn't true even when I went into the ministry. What we need now is to remind people of the
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:27.120]   spiritual nature of men, that men cannot live by bread alone. And if ever there was a need
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.840]   to emphasize this, it's now.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.640]   Well, shall we go to the second part of the question, that is on the spiritual exclusivity?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   Well, yes.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.040]   You are not a very enthusiastic ecumenist, are you?
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.500]   Well, I am, but not in the common sense of that term. I'm a great believer in church
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.560]   unity. I think that these divisions are sinful.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.200]   What grounds are there for this church unity that you want?
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.360]   Well, the New Testament teaches this. Our Lord's high priestly prayer that they all
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.460]   might be one and that the world might know we are meant to be one and to present this
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:06.080]   common message to the world. But there is all the difference in the world between a
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:13.400]   true spiritual, biblical New Testament unity and a mere amalgamation of people who call
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.440]   themselves Christian and who disagree violently with one another with regard to the very essentials
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.320]   of the gospel. That's my criticism of the ecumenical movement.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.520]   For instance, what would the public think if two men appeared on a political platform
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.720]   together, maintaining that they were standing for the same things, one of them an extreme
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.480]   socialist and the other a dyed-in-the-wool Tory? The world would ridicule.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   Well, now, that's the very thing.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.840]   I mean, isn't this possible? We see these variations within the Christian church. Is
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.880]   it really, must we really have one policy, one viewpoint arising from the Christian faith?
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:58.720]   Well, just a minute, let me put it like this to you. I think that there are certain broad
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:05.880]   distinctions and I would say that the one big dividing line is what I would call evangelical
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.960]   or non-evangelical. If you like, evangelical and more Catholic. Or, again, I'll put it
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.960]   in this way, men who believe in definitions of the faith and are opposed to any vagueness
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:26.200]   or uncertainty and those who take perhaps a more priestly view or put it more in terms
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.920]   of some vague general spirit of brotherhood and friendship and concern about humanity.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.040]   Yeah, but one is concerned that by this kind of division that you are making, that you
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   are really dividing the sheep and the goats, as it were, and that you are cutting out from
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.280]   your ecumenism at least half the Christian church.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   Well, yes, of course, but you see the Bible talks a great deal about this, about the remnant.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.720]   The Bible has a great deal to say about the remnant and we are not concerned about figures.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   Luther, you see, at one point...
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   But it isn't the remnant within the church, is it?
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   Well, no.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   The church is the remnant.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   No, no, not at all. You have a remnant within the church, as you had a remnant in Israel,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.480]   which was the church in the Old Testament. And Martin Luther at one point stood absolutely
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:17.080]   alone. You don't decide these matters in terms of figures. It's a question of your view of
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.920]   the truth. And I believe that the people outside are utterly confused when they see on the
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.640]   television or hear on the radio men both claiming to be Christians and standing for the same
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.760]   thing, but violently and totally disagreeing from one another with regard to the very content
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   of the gospel.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.320]   Well, then it comes an interpretation of the gospels.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.000]   Of course, precisely.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.680]   What is your source of authority for the statements you make, the deductions you make from the
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.680]   gospel?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.200]   Well, you see, I'm a typical and traditional Protestant. My source of authority is the
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.320]   Bible itself. Then you're going to ask me, I know immediately, but that's your interpretation.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.560]   Well, of course. But one is guided in this and one checks one's interpretation by what
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:09.360]   has been taught throughout the centuries, by the fathers, the patristic fathers, and
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:17.120]   by the reformers and by others. In other words, the Apostle John tells us that we have an
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.400]   unction from the Holy One and we know all things, he says. In other words, the Holy
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.080]   Spirit is in us and therefore we all ought to be capable of interpreting the scriptures.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:32.100]   But if we are truly Christian, we'll be humble and modest and we'll check our interpretation.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.400]   But this does mean that there must be some consensus somewhere.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   Well, there is.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.960]   If you cut out half the church, there's hardly going to be any consensus except within a
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   sect within the church.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.920]   Well, you've got a consensus in the other half.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.560]   Yes, but they must come together, surely.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.040]   Well, why? In other words, you are suggesting obviously that the Protestant Reformation
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   was a tragedy.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.600]   No, I'm not suggesting anything of the kind.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.040]   Well, but there was a division.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.880]   But there was a division, but the Protestant Reformation wasn't all right.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   I agree.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   Neither was the thing that they reacted against all right.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   All wrong, you mean.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   Yes, yes.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:15.240]   But there must come a time, surely, in the history of the Christian church when we must
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.440]   envisage the church coming together again, all these sections of the church.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.320]   No, no, I don't believe you will ever have a perfect church.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.880]   And this mechanical attempt today to produce one world church is to me something that's
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   quite impossible.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.320]   The church will never be perfect, even if you had the evangelical church that I'm looking
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.720]   forward to throughout the world, where there is a general consensus of opinion and agreement
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.960]   concerning the doctrines we hold to and stand for.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.600]   That would not be a perfect church by any means.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.480]   But there isn't a consensus within the evangelical movement, is there?
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.880]   There are minor differences, minor differences.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   Major differences, I would have thought.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.200]   No, no, no, I will not grant that there are major differences.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.100]   We have agreed about the content of the gospel.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.560]   We disagree at certain points in the application of what we believe in common.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   That I really must contend for that amongst conservative evangelicals.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.960]   And as you said, I preach in various parts of the world.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.360]   I find this, wherever I've been five months in America this year, I found it there.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   There is this.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.880]   Ralph, we've come to near the end of our time, and I want to give you the last word.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.920]   And I'd like to ask you this question.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.640]   What do you think the church needs above all else today?
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.360]   Well, I think I've really been answering the question the whole time, haven't I?
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.040]   She needs to be absolutely certain about her message.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.240]   We need to get back to the position of Paul when he went to Corinth.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.520]   I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.600]   We mustn't be trying to preach philosophy or politics or things of that kind.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.840]   We must go back to this New Testament message and realize on top of that, that without the
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.160]   power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit, even the preaching of that message will be
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.400]   in vain.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.680]   That is what I believe is absolutely essential today.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.400]   As Paul puts it in writing to the Thessalonians, "Our gospel came not unto you in word only,
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:16.700]   but also in power and in the Holy Ghost, and with much assurance."
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.520]   That's the essential.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.060]   Amen.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:26.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
