[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   What's cool is that interest rates can be refinanced and you can
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.800]   refinance your mortgage at any point.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.820]   So it's not like, Oh, I'm paying 7% right now on my mortgage.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.400]   Okay, fine.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.900]   Well, in two years, if they go back down, you refinance into a 5% or 4%.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.520]   You're not stuck for life with that.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.680]   But what doesn't typically and almost historically always go down as rents,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.260]   rents typically go up because inflation tends to go up, rates go up and down.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.000]   So it's kind of like dollar cost averaging.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.160]   When things go down, you just refinance to get the lower rate.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.280]   And then you lock in that rate for the next few years.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.480]   If they go down again, you just refinance again.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.200]   So I don't worry about rates right now because rates are temporary.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.520]   Rents are going up.
