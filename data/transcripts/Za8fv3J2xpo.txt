[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   I signed up for this newsletter called Loyalty Point Hunters.
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   And so I get these like, oh, here's this offer where you buy a meal kit and the discount
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.780]   basically makes it $5, but you get thousands of loyalty points.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.080]   And a part of me just really wants to play this game.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.720]   And then a part of me thinks it's absolutely crazy because I never fly American.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.900]   So I'm going to address my own problems after I run through this inventory.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.560]   But I figured it's kind of helpful to hear where all these statuses came from, how I
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.000]   ended up with them, because they do provide a ton of benefit.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.860]   When you have a lot of statuses, you're boarding early, you're earning more points, you're
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.300]   not paying for check bags, all kinds of things like that.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.440]   I am happy I have them.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.740]   I just think to some extent, it's a little crazy, given that we're not flying that often.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.620]   On the flip side, I really love it.
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.560]   And it's kind of a game.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.460]   So if I treat it from that perspective, then it's really interesting.
