[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]   We don't want to talk about Andrew.
[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.940]   I think that guy, Palmer Lucky, is super fascinating, the Oculus guy.
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.200]   Why do you want to talk about that company?
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.820]   Because I think an American company...
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.000]   He's launching a syndicate soon.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   No, I...
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.560]   Are you an investor?
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.920]   Palmer Lucky hates me.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.360]   He won't come on this week in startups.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.900]   He literally hates me.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.540]   What did you call him?
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.340]   Palmer Lucky?
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.240]   Palmer Lucky.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.640]   Cosplay Palmer.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.820]   He's a cosplayer.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.240]   I like the fact that he does cosplay.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.780]   What is that?
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.480]   That's when you dress up as comic book or like superhero characters and go to conventions
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.660]   without any ears.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.160]   You know how you dress up in the clothes of old Italian women?
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.740]   Yes.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.640]   He dresses up like a superhero.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.220]   These are cold open, folks.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.800]   I do dress like a Matrona sometimes.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.460]   Yeah, right.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.340]   I'm a Chimada.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.100]   I'm making you a rigatoni.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.480]   You are a rigatoni with the vodka sauce.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.540]   I'm making it for you.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.340]   In Italy, there's a culture in the olden days.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.680]   It's like you used to have these things called salotti, which basically meant all the decisions
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.660]   of the country were made by these people in the living rooms after dinner.
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.620]   And the most powerful people in the salotti.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.620]   Were these women who were married to these men and they would be the architects of all
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.620]   these decisions.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.620]   Oh, the Mussolini, I don't like him.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.620]   He never finished the pasta.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.220]   He always leave us so much on the plate.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.940]   And people would call them Matronas.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.660]   So I'd probably be a Matrona.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.500]   I've always felt you were like the old Italian lady in our group.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   Let your winners ride.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.500]   Rain Man, David Sacks.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500]   And it's sad.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   We open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone, "Oh, my God.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   I'm so sorry.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   I'm so sorry.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:38.080]   Hey everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.560]   podcast. Yes, we're still publishing Yes, we haven't been
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.740]   cancelled. But it's early in the show, so you never know. With me
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.820]   again, the dictator himself. The Sultan of Science, David
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.400]   Friedberg, whatever beverage you like I'll make it for you right
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.960]   now and his replicator. And of course, yeah, the Rain man
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.440]   himself. Yeah, definitely gonna win the midterms. Yeah, David
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.020]   Sachs. Everybody have a great week getting their asses kicked
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.700]   in the market.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.780]   I'm pretty good.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.400]   You're okay. Everybody. Okay, nobody.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240]   I can't look at my portfolio anymore. I just stopped
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.580]   checking.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.020]   Not a fan of the color red.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.360]   I actually I've been using this period to kind of desensitize
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.700]   myself. I went back and I started to think about like all
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.200]   of the
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.140]   sort of errors of commission that I've done in like the last
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.040]   decade. And I, I was able to look at like four or five
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.640]   specific trading moments where I was like, wow, what did I do that
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.920]   for? And I came away with two things. One was, if I confuse an
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.600]   investment with a trade, I'm done for meaning like there are
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.680]   things that you invest in that you just want to own forever.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.600]   And then there are things that are trades that are just
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.180]   speculative. And, you know, at the end of the day, you have a
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.840]   sense that it could be up in the short term. If I confuse those
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   two, I've made huge mistakes. And then the other one is I would
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.600]   always get really emotional and panic at the lows. And so I was
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.680]   like, you know, in early December or November, when I
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.820]   wrote that letter on Twitter, and we talked about it, and I
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.180]   sold a bunch of stuff after Jeff and, and Elon were selling,
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.600]   raise some cash. And I was like, Okay, now, I have enough buffer
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.320]   here. The whole point from here on out is to basically like,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.820]   insulate myself.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.460]   From my own emotional turmoil. Stocks go down. And so far so
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.240]   good. And my litmus test if when I go home, at the end of every
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.060]   day, you know, I check in with Nat and I'm like, Am I an asshole?
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.100]   Yes, what does that have to do with it?
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.360]   When I get crushed in the market, I tend to I tend to take
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.760]   it out on my friends and my loved ones. Honestly, because I
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.360]   were your friends. We come to your poker game, when your socks
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.000]   are down. And you're just like, Oh, my God, it once that's it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.860]   I'm popping the blinds up. I can't take it anymore. You
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.540]   remember last year to mop during the the market collapse. When
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.180]   at the start of COVID, and you decided you didn't care about
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.640]   having nice jeans anymore. And then you fast forward to
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.620]   December, and you're proclaiming the virtue of a $5,000 fresh
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.940]   alpaca sweater or whatever. I think another another indicator
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.360]   of sentiment in the market for you is your clothing. Oh my God.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.740]   choice. But this is a really nice cashmere ribbed sweater from
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.420]   the Loro Piano.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.200]   Okay,
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.240]   we're back in the game. It's good to see we're back to normal
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.060]   now. Yeah, let me ask you then I'm going to put a couple of
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.840]   items out there is Bitcoin a trade for you or an investment
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.420]   for you? Or was it and is it now?
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.840]   Well, I invested in 2011 at $80.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.800]   Yeah, yum yum.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.180]   I wrote an op ed in that same year in Bloomberg, which I hope
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.040]   at some point they take off the paywall. And the whole thing
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.920]   was you should have 1% of your net worth in this thing. Yeah.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.040]   It's remained an investment.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.600]   Since so still an investment.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.040]   Yeah, I've structured it so that I don't hold any Bitcoin
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.700]   personally myself because I don't want to have the pressure
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.880]   and the risk of keys and coins and wallets and this and that.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.080]   But I still really believe in Bitcoin in the long term.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.340]   Sacks, how do you how do you deal with the emotional turmoil
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.760]   of opening up your stocks, crypto, whatever wallet and
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.800]   seeing red and then going to work every day or he's just
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.720]   curled up in a ball playing chess with Peter Thiel?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.880]   Yeah, I mean, you just gotta try and ignore it.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.160]   Okay. Try try was a key word in that sentence.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.100]   It doesn't really affect me that much. I mean, so
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.440]   I run the avoidance acceptance function.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.140]   I have removed my emotions.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.720]   No, look, there are there are countervailing benefits. So when
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.760]   exit prices are great, entry prices are lousy. And when when
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.800]   entry prices are great, exit prices are lousy. So there's an
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.060]   inverse relationship. So in other words, all the the
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.320]   companies that I mean, the public markets have massively corrected
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.640]   and
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.360]   though and now finally, you know, we talked about this few
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.420]   few months ago, those new price levels have trickled their way
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.960]   down into venture markets. And so finally, you know, venture
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.600]   deals are starting to price at more reasonable prices. So in
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.340]   terms of harvesting gains from old investments, obviously, it's
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.540]   not as attractive as it was three months ago. But in terms
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.700]   of making new investments is much more attractive. And for a
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.560]   relatively young venture firm, which is what we are, we're going to have to do a lot of things.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.380]   We are, you know, we Yes, we do have some investments that are
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.560]   kind of in the harvesting stage. But you know, we're only a four or
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.860]   five year old firm. We're still the bulk of our activity is
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.600]   making new investments. So you know, it's not, it's, it's all
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.800]   just kind of part of the game. And I'm not really that worried
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.060]   about it.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.060]   Said another way, fortunes are made in the down market, they're
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.360]   collected in the upmarket is the way I always phrase it. But it's
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.540]   true, things are going to be on sale right now. And we saw Bill
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.440]   Ackman, I think, who I think is a friend of the pod.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.580]   listens. Yeah, super, super, super smart. Brilliant.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.680]   Yeah. And I just I just want to emphasize because I don't want
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.620]   founders to get the wrong idea. It's not like we're trying to
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.520]   pull one over on founders and get some sort of sweetheart deal
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.920]   or something like that. My view of like our role as VCs is just
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.100]   to be a price taker of whatever prices the market sets, we don't
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.680]   try and negotiate something better than market really, we
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.500]   just take the market price. And we pick the companies we want to
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.240]   be in. So that's our job is really just to pick not
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.860]   really to negotiate that much.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.180]   You're not you're not able to haggle. It's not like you can go
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.860]   Yeah, exactly. The market supermarket like, oh, bananas are
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.420]   $1 a pound, I'll take them for 50 cents. They're like, Sir, this
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.660]   is a Whole Foods, we don't negotiate. Right. So we're a
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.920]   price taker in good markets or bad markets. And it's just that
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.280]   I think that the prices now are coming down. Because what I've
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.820]   heard is that the crossover investors like tiger like KOTU
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.620]   who are deploying all this money, they've really slowed
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.080]   down. Now, I think they're all kind of licking their wounds.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.860]   And so like all this money that was flooding into the venture
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.020]   space is kind of on pause right now. And that's caused the price
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.160]   levels to drop
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.380]   the end of last year in q4. My public portfolio really started
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.100]   to turn over, took a huge amount of losses going into the end of
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.040]   the year. And then I took an accounting obviously of like the
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.560]   entire book and the public portfolio, every single thing
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.920]   that I owned, ultimately basically broke even last
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.240]   year. Somewhere up, I made some early sales somewhere way down by
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.440]   the end of the year net net, I kind of broke even. But my
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.500]   private book was up a billion dollars. And I told the team,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.420]   I'm like, No, this is not real. So we have to take those marks
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.420]   because, you know, you have other venture firms that are
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.420]   pricing these deals, and we get audited k ones. And so we have
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.060]   to take the up billion, but I told them, you should consider
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.880]   this that we had basically a down, you know, so net net, our
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.760]   returns were like, you know, we were up like 50% of the year,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.480]   like 15%. And I said, This is not real. We were at best break
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.880]   even and probably lost money. But you can't you can't not take
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.720]   these marks because like, you know, you have an entire fund
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.260]   complex that lives on these marks. Yeah, and by the way,
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.360]   by the way, compensation at all, but I have to take it.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.000]   Freeberg, then sex good for you.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.260]   That's a it's a really important point, because I think we talked
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.260]   about this one or two episodes ago. But there's a significant
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.240]   disincentive for venture firms to take markdowns to raise
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.600]   capital into a private business at a
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.340]   price that's lower than the prior round. Because when they
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.860]   do that, the marked value of their portfolio goes down. And
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.600]   then it makes it harder for that venture firm to go out and raise
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.980]   the next fund that they're going to try and raise from their LPS,
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.380]   because it looks like they're not good investors. And the
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.100]   reality is, and so in every round, as everyone on this pod
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.960]   knows, there's always an incentive and a push to see can
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.120]   you get the valuation higher, even if the business performance
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.840]   didn't meet the objectives of the prior round, and things have
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.220]   gone sideways a bit doesn't
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.080]   necessarily mean that it's a bad business. But it doesn't
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.480]   necessarily mean that it should always be getting an up round
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.820]   just because it's being kept alive. And there's this
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:09.680]   artificial pressure in private equity, in venture to always
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.540]   drive the value up or to run away from the company, because
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.580]   otherwise, you're going to have this markdown and you don't want
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.200]   to be putting money in a markdown that looks like a
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.320]   loser, and so on. And if you look at the public markets,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.120]   every successful company has had significant downturns in their
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   stock for significant periods of
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.200]   time, from Facebook, Amazon, to Facebook, to Amazon to Netflix.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.620]   And all of those businesses were sound businesses. It's just that
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.880]   for whatever reason, there were perturbations and markets
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.760]   perturbations in the business, but the long term value creation
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.800]   was still there. And so I think we need to kind of, you know, be
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.180]   really thoughtful. You know, and entrepreneurs should be very
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.120]   thoughtful not to give in to the venture mandate to always drive
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.020]   value up but to be really thoughtful about getting the
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.960]   right valuation for your business and getting the capital
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.020]   you need with the right partners.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.420]   Can I say something about this? It's so important what you said
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.120]   one of the tactics that I started three years ago was I run
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.740]   my own shadow portfolio, where I don't take the marks and I just
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.900]   keep them at my cost basis. And I'm not allowed to use that for
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.180]   anything. I don't you know, I can't use that. Obviously, I
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.260]   would never use that for compensation with my team or
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.500]   anything else. But I use it in my own head to say, Okay, if I
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.520]   invested $1, let's not think about what somebody else may
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.360]   think about what that dollars worth, let's just keep it at $1
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.300]   and let's just keep it at $2. And I'm not allowed to use that
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.260]   money. I'm not allowed to use that money. I'm not allowed to
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.340]   use that money. I'm not allowed to use that money. I'm not
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.420]   allowed to use that money. I'm not allowed to use that money.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.420]   But it's a very difficult thing to do. And the reason I do that
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.240]   is because I don't have the pressure to raise incremental
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.280]   funds. But if I did, I wouldn't be able to play that game. And
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.580]   I'd be very focused on making sure other VCs marked up my
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.320]   deals. Because to your point, it takes 1012 years to drive
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.040]   liquidity, literally, that's the key here. And so what are you
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.080]   supposed to do if you're a venture business in year three
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.800]   or four, except raise money on markups, paper money, you know,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.320]   paper markups are the they're the they're the lifeblood of
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.560]   what this industry going? Yeah, totally.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.920]   Well, I mean, the interesting thing for me is I LP to a couple
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.080]   of these small, like emerging fund managers, you know,
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.940]   micro funds 10 million or so 3 million. And they were sending
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.820]   like a lot of updates. And so I'm in some top tier venture
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.840]   firms that some of you are in. And they send you an audit every
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.260]   year. And they send you a distribution cash on cash,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.600]   here's where you're at. And then I was getting like quarterly
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.640]   emails, as everything was going up, these
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.000]   new fund managers are like, we're at 100 IRR, we're at 200%
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.060]   IRR, because this crypto investment we did, got marked
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.080]   up. And I was just thinking about what Bill Gurley would
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.600]   always say, which I think is a Howard Marks quote, you can't
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.880]   eat IRR. Like, what are we doing here? Like, why is there
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.900]   such a focus on this is because you want to raise your next
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.160]   fund. And then the other game people were playing was, and I
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.940]   got into this, because people were like, oh, you know, you're
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.480]   grossly undervaluing your funds, because Robin Hood is trading
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.840]   at $30 a share on the private markets comm is trading at this
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.820]   and the private markets. And the second people were using
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.880]   secondary market transactions as their mark. So I'm curious,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.840]   Sax, how do you think about if you invested in a company, the
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.960]   series B was $100 a share, but then somebody bought it at 150 a
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.840]   share in the private markets? Where do you like to mark that
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.240]   in your funds? Or how do you think about that? And getting
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.480]   ahead of your skis in terms of valuing your private funds?
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.620]   Well, to Jermas points, we have accounting rules around this. So
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.320]   we can't like subjectively
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.000]   decide like what mark to set for each company for, you know,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.960]   obvious reasons, our LP was one, like, a predictable accounting.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.240]   So the way it generally works is that you the mark is set by the
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.400]   most recent private, you know, financing. This is the way it
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.620]   works. And if people want to discount it from there, they
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.940]   certainly can, you know,
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.460]   what about a secondary transaction? Is there any
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.080]   more complicated rules around that, because it's a different
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.160]   class of stock. So it's
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.340]   it's some combination of sometimes we use a foreign I know
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.180]   sometimes it's the latest preferred round, it's, you know,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.420]   it just, there's like complicated rules around it.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.140]   By the way, I'll just rehash what was already said. And just
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.480]   to say it one more time to mark pointed out that it typically
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.160]   takes 12 years to liquidity from the time a startup is initially
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.540]   funded to the time that you sell it or go public. Show me one
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.880]   public company that has had 12 years of consistent gain in its
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.740]   stock price. It doesn't exist.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.360]   And so again, like this, this notion that you know, every
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.560]   startup is seeing some perpetual persistent increase in value is
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.640]   an artifice that
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.400]   well, it doesn't really represent it doesn't it doesn't
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.740]   exist in tech. And that's that that's a feature not a bug.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.940]   Right? Meaning the things that can go up predictably for 10 to
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.220]   12 years are not necessarily businesses. They don't take
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.220]   risk. They're not dynamic. No, they don't take risk. Yeah.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.460]   Sacks, can you define perturbation for the audience? I
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.840]   heard freeberg say that a couple of times, perturbation would
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.140]   be hurt her patient changes. What like volatility basically?
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.980]   Yeah, rapid change,
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.720]   anxiety, mental uneasiness. Okay, a cause of anxiety or
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.480]   uneasiness. Okay, I got it. I thought you were saying another
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.380]   word. You don't use the word perturbation. I thought you said
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.160]   another word. What word was in your brain? I thought I heard
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.240]   masturbation. I was like, Master. What exactly did he say
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.680]   about the markets? Speaking of markets, we were on a text on our
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.000]   text thread talking about if we're about to have the start of
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.980]   World War Three. And then maybe this is not in the news now. How
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.820]   do we look at the UK Russia situation in the Ukraine?
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.860]   Obviously, 100,000 troops are amassing on a border. And what
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.080]   is the goal here? Because Biden is saying, Hey, listen, if
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.000]   anything happens, we're going to go to war.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.000]   And there's a lot of saber rattling here. I don't exactly
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.600]   understand what Putin's goal or motivation is. And that's, I
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.720]   think, what I'm not hearing in the news is exactly what is his
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.400]   goal? What are your thoughts on what's happening in the Ukraine
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.260]   and Russia? sex?
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.200]   Okay, well, I think first of all, we have to kind of level
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.760]   set in historical terms about how unusual and unprecedented it
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.640]   would be for us to send troops to fight, you know, potentially
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.360]   Russia in a border.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.600]   I mean, we've seen the border conflict with Ukraine with and
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.680]   by the way, the Biden put 8500 troops on alert for deployment
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.020]   this week. It's really without historical precedent during the
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:41.120]   Cold War. You know, in 1956, Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.660]   to crush rebels there. Eisenhower did nothing 1968.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.240]   Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.200]   Spring. LBJ did nothing 1981. The Soviets crushed the Solidarity Movement
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.980]   in Poland. Ronald Reagan did nothing even though he had
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.860]   campaigned on getting tough with the Soviets. And then more
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:06.580]   recently in 2008. When Russia invaded Georgia, George W. Bush
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:12.220]   did not intervene militarily. And then 2014, when Putin occupied
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:17.080]   Crimea, Obama did nothing. And so this idea and the reason for
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.160]   that in all those cases is because America has a vital
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.040]   national interest in avoiding war.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.180]   With the nuclear armed Russia, and we did not have a vital
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.080]   national interest in defending the territorial sovereignty of
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.240]   those nations. That's the bottom line. And so for us to be now
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.960]   beating the drums of war and talking about sending troops
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.400]   into a war zone with Russia is just it's unbelievably
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.480]   irresponsible.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.000]   Friedberg, one might speculate if they were cynical, some sort
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.880]   of wag the dog situation here.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.440]   I mean, Biden's not doing well, he's lowest popularity ever. Midterms
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   are coming up. Is there any political motivation here? Do you
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.920]   think in what Biden's actions are, you know, given the context
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.480]   of what Sachs just outlined?
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.860]   I think that there's, this is like showing up to the, you
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.920]   know, the last 20 minutes of a two hour movie, and then saying,
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.680]   Oh, my gosh, what's this guy doing? He's so crazy. There's a
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.460]   long narrative that precedes the current news cycle on what's
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.720]   happening with Putin and the Ukraine. You know, in large,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.040]   part, the United States helped to start the fuel, the expansion
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.080]   of NATO in the 90s. And the intention was to make NATO as a
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.300]   Western allied kind of organization contain Russia step
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.860]   up right to their borders get very close and, and ultimately
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:47.020]   make these kind of, you know, areas, free liberal democracies
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.260]   that are aligned with the West, and put them right on Russia's
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.560]   border. And that is obviously,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.120]   antagonistic. If anyone tried to do that to the United States,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.620]   like Russia did with the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would view
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.100]   that as a hostile act, and we would react accordingly. And for
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.340]   years, the pressure has been built in and has been mounting,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.960]   as Putin has started to kind of solidify his political power at
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.020]   home and his allies abroad, in trying to figure out ways to
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.680]   push back on this wall that has been built around him and his
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.400]   nation. And, you know,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.820]   to some degree, I think we look at this as like, his aggressive
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.140]   behavior, but to some extent, it is a defensive behavior over a
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.620]   very longer cycle when when viewed that way. And again, like
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.880]   remember, the US had this Monroe Doctrine, which President Monroe
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.520]   put in place, and I don't know, 18, something 1800 something
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   that said, you know, anyone that comes into our territory, and
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.360]   tries to influence nations around us to be hostile towards
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.480]   us is a hostile act in and of itself. Anytime someone tries to
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.240]   influence our politics, it's hostile.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.540]   And I think Russia views our behavior and NATO's behavior
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.060]   this way. And so his primary demand is and has always been
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.680]   that the Ukraine cannot and will not and should not join NATO. And
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.980]   the US response has and continues to be and and the EU
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.940]   and the EU. And we're saying, look, we we believe in the
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.760]   sovereignty of the Ukraine. And we want the Ukraine to make
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.000]   their own decision about where they go and what they do. But
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.340]   the reality is, for us, this is a key part of a very long term
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.200]   strategy to keep Russia contained. Now, meanwhile,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.080]   there's this beautiful
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.320]   backdrop of what's going on with China. And if I'm China, I
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.080]   would love to see the US and Russia in conflict, because it
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.960]   will weaken the US. And if I'm Russia, I would love to see the
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.840]   US and China in conflict, because it will weaken the US.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.740]   The US is in a very precarious situation right now. And for us
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.180]   to actually end up in conflict is going to weaken our position
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.660]   with one of these other two emerging, you know, challenging,
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.700]   you know, superpowers. And this is a really precarious time, I
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.160]   think, to Sax's point, it's highly unlikely we're gonna end
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.820]   up sending military. But the
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.800]   cost sharing is such that we need to kind of hold our line
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.380]   until the very last minute, we'll see what happens. I did
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.020]   say, you know, at the end of the year, I do think that we're in
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.480]   this kind of economic status right now that if there were an
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.920]   opportunity for conflict, we're probably more likely to want to
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.040]   engage in conflict than not, because it does create something
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.260]   that we all get behind it create, you know, kind of
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.080]   political unity, it creates economic unity, it creates
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.920]   driving forces that maybe might help us through what is clearly
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.320]   a very volatile and difficult time at home.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.580]   So let's see what happens.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.480]   I think Obama has already given us the endgame. I just think we
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.640]   have to go through the machinations to get there. He
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.220]   said to the Atlantic, I think it was in 2016 or 17. He said, the
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.220]   fact is that Ukraine, which is a non NATO country is going to be
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.960]   vulnerable to military domination by Russia, no matter
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.080]   what we do. And you know, every time there was this brinksmanship,
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.380]   we effectively blinked and rightfully so because it didn't
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.100]   necessarily make sense to, to all of a sudden engage the war
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.560]   machine to go to war in Eastern Europe.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.280]   The thing that's interesting about what happened here, though,
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.040]   was that this was a slow moving train wreck that was really
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.540]   visible years and years ago. Why is that? Well, if you look at
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.140]   what was really happening, this is really a European issue. And
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.920]   you got to think, well, why is America being the leading actor
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   here? When you know, where's Europe in all of this? Well, it
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.940]   turns out that, you know, the strongest power in Europe,
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.320]   Germany, is in a really difficult situation, because they rely
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.000]   on Russian energy. 50% of the nat gas that comes in, or 50% of
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.720]   the energy, I think that comes into Germany is from Russia. And
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.660]   they've, in fact, been building an entire pipeline system from
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.180]   Russia that bypasses the Ukraine and go straight to Germany. And
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.660]   so when all of the saber rattling was happening, Germany
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.400]   basically had to blink because they need Russia's energy. And
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.820]   why did they need Russia's energy? Well, they needed
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.240]   Russia's energy, because 20 years ago, the environmentalist
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.940]   in Germany won, and they started decommissioning all their nuclear
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.380]   reactors. So ridiculous. So at somewhere along the way, nobody
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.920]   took a science class in Germany and figured out that nuclear was
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.460]   both safer and cleaner. Instead, burning fossil fuels is the answer.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.460]   And geopolitically wiser to not have a dependency. And after the
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.520]   Fukushima, they went, turned them all off, they accelerated
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:10.720]   it.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.940]   Yeah, it made more sense to burn fossil fuels, number one, and
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.200]   then to get those fossil fuels from Russia. So unfortunately,
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.080]   we are in the state of affairs where
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.960]   Germany has said, at least it's been reported, that they would
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.220]   shut down this pipeline Nord Stream two if if Russia did
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.700]   something. But the reality is, I think Obama basically told us
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.720]   that, you know, it's going to be very difficult for us to justify
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.840]   an act like this, especially against somebody who is
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.760]   fortified and clever and smart. This is not like invading the
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.080]   Middle East. And so this is a massive, if this happens, the
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.220]   the stock markets will just go absolutely to zero. I mean, if
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.680]   you could have negative stock prices,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.740]   this may be a good catalyst to take these Netflix shares,
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.280]   please.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.180]   It's unbelievable. It's really, really crazy.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.920]   This is it seems like a situation where we're assured not
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.000]   to get into to mix it up with him. Like I don't understand
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.640]   Putin. I don't understand Biden saying that he's absolutely
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.960]   going to react to this. Because we're not we can't afford to
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.260]   get into a war right now.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:19.520]   And if that is true, then, you know, US dominance, the US ability
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.880]   to hold the line starts to decline. And
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.760]   I don't know if I agree with that. Because I think we could
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.640]   defuse this crisis very easily. Yeah, which is the exit ramp.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.340]   Yeah, tell us. Well, the the exit ramp here is what is Putin
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.840]   demanding? Putin is demanding that we affirm that Ukraine will
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.980]   not be part of NATO. In my view, that in my view, that's giving
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.300]   him the sleeves off our vest because we should not want to
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.380]   add Ukraine or Georgia to NATO.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.320]   That would do nothing to enhance the security of the United
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320]   States, we wouldn't get anything out of it. But we would be
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.120]   obligated under Article five of exactly to defend them. So
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:05.000]   admitting Ukraine or Georgia or Moldova could ultimately bring us
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.200]   into a war with Russia too. Exactly. So to free to
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.980]   freeburgs point earlier, we have been poking the bear for two
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.100]   decades with our expansion of NATO right up to Russia's front
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.600]   porch.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.960]   And if you go all the way back to 1990, when George Herbert
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.980]   Walker Bush was President and James Baker was Secretary of
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.100]   State, there was an assurance made by James Baker that that,
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.460]   you know, basically, they had gone to Gorbachev and said, we
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.640]   want to, you know, we for help in reunifying Germany. And the
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.120]   promise made that famously that James Baker said is that what
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.580]   Gorbachev said is we don't want NATO expansion. And Baker
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:47.060]   apparently said not one inch eastward was the line. And, and
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:47.300]   we think back to the time when we were in the war with Russia,
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.960]   we think back to how well Herbert Walker Bush and James
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.180]   Baker managed the end of the Cold War. How did they do that?
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.900]   They, they did that by making assurances to Russia that we
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.720]   would not bring NATO up to their front porch as well, which is
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.660]   what we did. In 2000. We've now added something like 14
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:08.360]   countries in Eastern Europe to, you know, to NATO, including in
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.380]   2004, the the Baltic countries and that decision by George W.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.140]   Bush really is the thing that pretty much severed our
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.760]   relationship with with Putin.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.320]   You have to remember that Putin is, he is fairly popular in
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.040]   Russia because he stokes Russian nationalism. And what is the
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.340]   source of that nationalism? It is because a single tree
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.600]   organization NATO now has this huge contiguous border with
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.760]   Russia, they now feel encircled. And if we were to add Ukraine
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.140]   to that organization, there'd be a 1200 mile, again, border,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.100]   which that Russia would have with with just this one,
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.600]   this one alliance, it would be akin to imagine if we were still
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.740]   in the Cold War, and Canada were added to the Warsaw Pact, right?
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.940]   I mean, we would be incredibly threatened by that. So and so
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.700]   but but you know, you never hear it, Jake, you never hear any of
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.880]   this on the news. All you hear is the beating of the war drums.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.060]   And Putin is portrayed as this mad dictator. He has no
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.900]   legitimate concerns. Now look, Putin is an authoritarian. And
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.600]   you could describe him as a bully and a thug and he has
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.560]   provoked a dictator.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.600]   He has provoked the situation, certainly. Okay. But, you know,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.040]   we treat him as if he has no valid concerns whatsoever. And I
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.800]   think the simplest thing to do to defuse this crisis would
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.040]   simply be to say, yes, we have no intention of adding Ukraine
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.400]   to NATO. And then we will find out if Putin is a liar or not.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.500]   Well, that would be a great move. Like it's a that would be
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.540]   like, hey, let's take a five year pause. Okay, you know what,
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.580]   we'll negotiate with you. We'll take five years, we won't put
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.820]   him in NATO, give give a little bit of a concession, because
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.020]   their country is not doing well.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.800]   Their GDP trails China and the United States, their GDP per,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.180]   you know, each citizen is incredibly low compared to the
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.060]   West, like, and then we could just work with Germany to get
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.540]   on sustainables, which is what their goal is. And we could
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.020]   economically continue to trounce them because as you point out
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.840]   every week, Chamath, they're not an important economy.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.320]   Here's what Obama said about Putin. Obama said,
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.960]   the truth is actually Putin in all of our meetings is
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.480]   scrupulously polite, very frank. Our meetings are very
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.420]   businesslike. He never keeps me waiting two hours like he does a
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.780]   bunch of these other folks. He's constantly interested in being
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.740]   seen as our peer. And as working with us because he's not
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.560]   completely stupid. He understands that Russia's
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.200]   overall position in the world is significantly diminished.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.740]   Yeah, he's not crazy. He's not dumb. And by the way,
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.960]   nationalism, as Sachs points out, which is a primary, you
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.940]   know, drum call for Putin, is not a novel sense. We we are a
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.520]   nationalist country. Nationalism is, you know, pride and wanting
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.640]   to make sure that your country is treated with respect and have
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.220]   sovereignty. And so I don't think that Putin is an
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.160]   irrational actor. His behavior is very rational in response to
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   what's gone on for 30 years. And his requests are that he is
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.680]   feeling threatened and he's trying to avoid military
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.920]   conflict as much as he can. And we portray him as being an
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.440]   aggressor that's demanding military conflict. And at the
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.200]   end of the day, our behavior over a long period of time as a
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.400]   country has driven us to the brink here.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.960]   And I think Sachs is right, you know, the right decision may
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.620]   very well be to kind of, you know, leave the region alone and
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.980]   focus on issues that matter more deeply to us and are a higher
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.380]   priority rather than drawing us into this. But a better
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.780]   investment would be in sustainable energy. I think the
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.240]   economic seed is planted for us to be in some sort of conflict
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.280]   this year. So, you know, we're going to end up
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.220]   Explain what you mean by that, Freiberg, economic seed to be in
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:37.760]   some sort of conflict.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.580]   I think that, you know, generally, if you're not going
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.860]   to see homegrown, you know, economic growth, you know,
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.040]   economic productivity gains, and you're suffering trade
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.840]   issues, like we're going to suffer this year, given the
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.720]   supply chain problems globally, we're going to look for some
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.740]   place to manufacture growth. And there's no better way to
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.180]   manufacture growth than through
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.140]   wag the dog
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.800]   through conflict.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.680]   The foreign policy establishment in Washington, you know, the
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.620]   neocons, the you know, the so called Washington blob, I mean,
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.080]   here they are beating the drums for war. We haven't been in a
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.840]   war for what six months, we just got out of Afghanistan. And now
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.080]   they want us back in another war. And the media just keeps
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.320]   No bueno.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.520]   fueling and fomenting this. And they don't, you know, their
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.080]   coverage of it is, well, it's exactly what we talked about
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.140]   last week, Jake out when I pointed out that your, your
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.980]   rhetoric, your humanitarian rhetoric as noble as the
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.640]   sentiments are, when it gets whipped up into a lather and a
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.420]   frenzy by the media, it blunders us into a bunch of stupid
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.140]   foreign interventions.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.480]   I would not call it rhetoric, let's call it beliefs. My
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.740]   beliefs are not rhetoric, but I get your point.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.600]   Is there any
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.300]   We are one week later, and exactly what I said, the risk of
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.860]   this is,
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.820]   has now materialized.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.360]   Clearly, you're blaming my position on human rights.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.100]   What I'm saying is that this type of rhetoric is used by the
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.720]   military industrial complex and the Washington blob and the
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.740]   neocons to stampede us into wars that don't make any sense.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.300]   That's what I predicted a week ago. That's where that was my
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.560]   concern death that later and we're in exactly that
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.100]   situation.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   It is our most successful export. It is our most
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.120]   successful export.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.520]   Jake, how really important is the difference between there's a
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.840]   difference between belief
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.960]   and how do you act on that belief and what are your actions
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.860]   based on that belief?
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.620]   And I think that a big part of what's gone on and this harkens
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.620]   back to a few episodes ago when we all got in trouble. There was
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.980]   an attempt at canceling us after we spoke about this. But when
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.600]   those beliefs are, as Sachs pointed out, harnessed in a way
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:35.120]   that is ultimately co opted in a way to fuel and to drive, you
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.120]   know, conflict, it, it obviously goes beyond belief and it
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.180]   starts to move into an area where there is a very wide range of beliefs.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.720]   It's a very wide spectrum of action. Yeah. And it's very easy
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.880]   to tip yourself onto the one side of the spectrum. And as a
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.180]   result, cause a lot of harm and a lot of damage like we've done
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.900]   in Afghanistan, like we've done in Iraq.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.300]   Here's a great lens. What is the cost of going to war in the
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.460]   Ukraine versus whatever human rights or sovereignty issues
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.480]   they have? Hundreds of 1000s of troops going to war is going to
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.540]   result in more human suffering than what's currently happening
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.340]   for Ukraine. It's sort of exactly they're going to they're
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.180]   going to be in the middle of the war is going to happen on their
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.720]   turf. The humanitarian interest is in diffusing the situation.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.660]   Exactly. 100%. And the way to do it in a way is to, is to, you know,
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:25.340]   exceed to see one demand that Putin has about not admitting Ukraine
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.820]   to NATO, which just to say something more about why we shouldn't want
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:35.160]   that. The problem in Ukraine and Georgia and Moldova, first of all,
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.740]   these are not North Atlantic countries, right? This is mission creep
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.260]   by NATO. They're in the caucuses.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.680]   And the problem they have is they're sort of these breakaway, you
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.620]   know, Russian republics, but inside of these countries, there's
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:52.980]   breakaway provinces, you know, they're ethnically Russian areas
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.980]   within these countries that want to break away from them. So you
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.240]   have a breakaway within the breakaway. And so you've got
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.220]   these powerful forces. It's complicated. It's very
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.260]   complicated. So for example, in Georgia in 2008, when there was a
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.880]   war there, and Russia did invade Georgia, but it was on behalf of
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.080]   these breakaway.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:17.100]   provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And then in, in Ukraine,
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.700]   they've got the Donbass and Crimea, which has now been annexed by
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:28.140]   Russia, which are these majority ethnically Russian areas. You know,
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.900]   and same problem in Moldova. So the problem is, you've got these like
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.820]   incredibly complicated border disputes within these countries, based on
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.900]   ethno nationalist
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.400]   tribalism. And, you know, sounds familiar, right? The US does not
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.460]   have a vital national interest in getting involved in those
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.400]   disputes. And by admitting these countries into NATO, they could
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.760]   pull us into those disputes, because the key provision article
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.060]   five of NATO says an attack on one is an attack on all were
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.760]   obligated to go to the defense of those nations. How is the
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.060]   security of the United States enhanced by that requirement?
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.540]   They get a lot out of it, we don't get anything out of it.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.600]   This is slightly this is a distinctly different than say,
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.180]   Taiwan as an issue. But let's put that aside. And we'll get to
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:17.880]   that in a second. If China and Russia and the United States are
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.560]   in this very complicated chessboard, is there a way not
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.060]   only to defuse the situation? But is there a way and I know
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.860]   this sounds like a crazy Hail Mary, to deepen the relationship
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.560]   with Putin and make Russia and the United States in some way
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.360]   allies against this relationship with China, because the Russia
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.300]   China relationship is also very complex. Is there some path to
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.100]   us having a better relationship?
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.440]   He's holding a summit. The last person he saw in real life was
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:51.600]   the leader of Pakistan in 2020. Before the pandemic started, you
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.860]   know who he's meeting within two weeks before the Olympics start
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:59.920]   or in a week, it's put in person. And then the there's
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.360]   going to be a tripartite alliance conference between
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:09.120]   China, Russia and Iran. Great. So I think this idea that
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.360]   that all of a sudden, somebody is going to found some holier than
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.940]   thou perspective on what the right thing to do is for other
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.880]   people is going to be challenged. So those guys are going to think
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.100]   about themselves. And they're creating alliances to basically
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.840]   further advance their own objectives. And so I think we
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.400]   have to as well. The thing here, I think what de escalates all of
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.920]   this is economic sanctions and monetary impact. Because if
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.820]   Nord Stream two
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.700]   doesn't get turned on, which is in Germany's control, that has a
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.820]   huge economic impact to Russia, explain what it is. Nord Stream
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.000]   two is that pipeline that I just talked about the nat gas
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.060]   pipeline that that basically doubles the amount of nat gas
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.840]   flowing from Russia into Germany and essentially into all of
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.340]   Europe.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.560]   But hasn't Germany said if they invade the Ukraine,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.660]   they haven't said it, they haven't said it on the record
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:05.940]   they it is it is thought that Chancellor Schultz that that it's
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.220]   theoretically on the table, but it hasn't been officially
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.700]   declared.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:15.640]   Biden today said that he's talked or somebody in the White House, has talked to all the major
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.300]   banks in the US about crippling economic sanctions. So I do think the way this gets
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:26.000]   de escalated is through money. And if you, you know, if you severely impinge Russia's ability
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.440]   to sort of grow their economy, that foments a lot of, you know, anger at home. And I don't think
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:38.380]   that, you know, that'll probably weaken and destabilize Putin more than, you know,
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:45.280]   trying to sort of have a, I don't know, some kind of like, get together and hug it out session with
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.600]   him. Yeah, I mean, so Jason, you raise a good point with, you know, can we improve our relation
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.840]   with Putin? Obama tried, right? We had the whole reset. And ultimately, it wasn't tremendously
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:02.400]   successful. But I think a lot of it has to do with the way that the foreign policy established
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.580]   from Washington sort of reacts. And Obama had some really good quotes about this.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.900]   I think it was in that Atlantic article where, you know, first, he described that,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:18.320]   you know, that Russia has a vital interest in Ukraine in a way we don't, because it's right
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.560]   there, it's on their border, they've been attacked, Russia has through the Ukraine,
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:29.260]   you know, throughout history. So, again, it's just a primary interest of theirs. And so after
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:35.680]   saying that, Obama, then, you know, he basically got attacked.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:42.520]   You know, by, you know, in a, but it was some of it was partisan, but and then he responded to
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.500]   the attacks by saying, if there's someone in this town, Washington, DC, that would claim that we
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.060]   would consider going to war with Russia over Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, they should speak up and be
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:58.300]   very clear about it, that he challenged. And then he said, so the issue and no one did, right? No one
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:03.160]   was willing to just come right out and say that we should go to war over this. And that's how he
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.300]   refused the attacks on himself. And then Obama continued, he said, there's a playbook in Washington
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.740]   that presidents are supposed to follow. And the playbook prescribes responses to different events.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:16.540]   And these responses tend to be militarized responses, you're judged harshly, if you don't
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.740]   follow the playbook, even if there are good reasons. So what Obama is saying is that no one
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:29.380]   would defend a more militarized posture and going to war against Russia over the Crimea. And yet,
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.860]   he was somehow portrayed as suspect, you know,
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.100]   by
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:40.300]   not being tough enough on Russia. And so, you know, if you're Putin, and you see constantly,
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:46.000]   the foreign policy establishment, you know, reacting in this way, it's not a problem that
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.440]   even one president can just fix overnight, you know, what would change this is if when we send
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:56.920]   100,000 troops over there, it's a draft. And, you know, it's not an all paid military, the fact that
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.340]   these people in Washington who got their kids in Georgetown, or Harvard, or wherever they are,
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.040]   Stanford, don't have to send their kids over there to fight this
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.580]   war, is one of the reasons they can write these documents and have these doctrines that hey, you
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.720]   got to send all these troops into harm way harm's way, like if they had to send their sons and
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.620]   daughters, it would be a much different discussion of like, where we're going to start a war,
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.240]   whether it's Afghanistan or the Ukraine.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:25.000]   But let's go to markets. Bill Ackman came over the top, he's buying a ton of Netflix. And Tesla
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.980]   just absolutely flipped to becoming a money printing machine, and had a ridiculous quarter,
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:42.940]   revenues up 53 to 53 billion up 71% year over year, q4 revenue 17,000,065% year over year. And
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:49.360]   they increased their deliveries by 71%. And now you're all of a sudden to start see some,
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.540]   you know, income coming into the company. So flipping from money losing to break even to now
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:02.920]   printing a ton of money. Microsoft had an absurd quarter, their revenue hit 51.7 billion, up 20%.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:11.080]   In the quarter, 20% year over year pays for $200 billion in revenue in 2022. And their net income
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.860]   was also up 20 plus percent at 18.8 billion. So the money printing machine in these companies
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.900]   is just extraordinary. Chamath, what are your thoughts?
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.000]   I think you're you're you forgot a couple of key things, which is that the FOMC meeting happened
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.780]   this week. And Powell basically said, Look, we're going to start tightening in March. I
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.860]   think the way that he said it, you know, all of these words tend to be so scrutinized and overanalyzed.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:39.640]   But the instead of figuring out what people thought, I think their actions post the FOMC
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.540]   are important, which is that, you know, we effectively now started to price in
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:50.020]   about five rate hikes this year. So probably 525 point rate hikes effectively, that's what that's
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:56.860]   what the that's what the yield curve tells us. If you take a big step back, I just want to remind
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:02.800]   people like, it's really hard to live through volatility, right? And we're in the phase of it now.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:09.940]   But typically, these big drawdowns are like, you know, when stocks go down, it actually precedes so
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:16.420]   it comes before the actual starting of a rate hike cycle. And so if you go back to the, you know,
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:23.140]   from 1950 onwards today, every time the government has started to raise rates,
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.800]   or the Federal Reserve has started to raise rates, the stock markets have actually rallied.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.740]   Now, why is that? It's typically that they see through the end of the rate hike cycle. And they
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:37.900]   start to price the business as if these rate hikes are done and to rebase things. And on average,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.800]   I think the stock markets go up between seven and 8%. So call it seven and a half, eight and a half
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:48.400]   percent. And so what's interesting to me is now, we're finally starting the process of these hikes.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.040]   And the real question is going to be how data dependent do these guys get? And what I mean
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.120]   by that is, so you know, we talked about this before, but you know, China cut rates.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.680]   This past weekend, actually, Germany decreased their GDP forecast.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.480]   And so you're starting to see two huge countries already say, Hey, wait a minute, we need to be,
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.340]   you know, we need to be more realistic about what long term growth looks like here.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.900]   It's inconceivable in my mind that those countries are slowing down, and we won't.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:22.600]   And so I think what happens in these other huge GDP drivers of world GDP will affect us.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.040]   And so you know, Saxon, I have said this before, but the marginal risk will be
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.620]   that we overcorrect and actually create a recession that doesn't need to be one. So we
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.920]   have to be more realistic about what's going to happen. And so I think that's the real question.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.820]   And I think that's the real question. And I think that's the real question.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.420]   And I think that's the real question. And I think that's the real question.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.440]   The market is a leading indicator of what's going to happen post the rate hikes.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.100]   We had a nice relief rally going until I think some of the words that Powell used was that there
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:50.440]   was plenty of room for rate hikes. Yeah, meaning that because unemployment's at three and a half
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:56.020]   percent that you know, we're at full employment. And that means that the Fed can you know, has this
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:02.560]   dual mission of keeping inflation low and you know, keeping employment high. So if employment is high,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.420]   then they've got more room to raise rate. Anyway, it was that language around the plenty of room
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:13.720]   that freaked markets out and they triggered a huge sell off. I think to Jamal's point, I don't see how
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:20.740]   you can have this much wealth destroyed so quickly and have it not impact the real economy. There's
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:26.380]   a lot of people out there who feel a lot poorer, because their portfolios have gotten slashed in
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.000]   value. I mean, anybody with- So they'll tightening,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.500]   they'll clench, not spend as much money on a vacation, not buy a TV or a car.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.980]   So these wait lists for cars might get, you know, become sales.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:43.420]   The luxury markets of the economy, the optional purchases start to really slow down. And so I
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:49.660]   think that the risk of recession now is much higher than it was even a month ago. Now, you know, it's
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.980]   going to be hard to know. So basically, I think what we're saying is, it's gonna be very hard for
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:44:01.240]   the Fed to engineer a soft landing here, where we don't trigger a recession in the process of
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.440]   stopping inflation.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:08.380]   And look, well, Judge Powell's performance, you know, at the end of this, you know, we're not
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:14.560]   going to know. I think it's, but I think that he's turned out to be much more hawkish in his
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.600]   statements than markets were expecting. That's pretty clear.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.580]   Again, and in 2018, you know, he was probably overly hawkish, and he actually created,
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:26.860]   effectively, a little mini recession. We didn't pay attention enough to it because, you know,
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:32.380]   Trump made it impossible to see the signal from the noise. But it did happen, and it was
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.420]   Powell being a little too trigger happy. And so, you know, we have to remember that, you know,
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:43.720]   the Fed has $9 trillion of assets on their balance sheet. And so, you know, if they start to take $9
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:49.060]   trillion of cash out of the system, by selling these assets into the market, right, you're
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.240]   taking the money out, right, because you're getting money back. That's going to have an
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.520]   enormous huge impact as well. So if you think about-
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.020]   Stupid question, Chamath. What happens when that money comes out?
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.240]   One second, let me just finish. One second. One second. Let me finish, please.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:02.320]   So, you know, so when you have these two things happening at the same time, you
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.260]   have a potential rate hike cycle, which makes the cost of a used car more expensive, the cost of your
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.760]   credit card balance is more expensive, the obligations you have to pay just become naturally
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.140]   more expensive, you feel poorer, so you spend less. And then separately, in the financial markets,
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:23.320]   you actually take liquidity out of the system. And so people value, you know, liquidity more,
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:31.180]   it becomes worth more, you value current cash more. I mean, we're putting ourselves in a really
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.260]   delicate position. So he's-
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.340]   He's got a delicate balancing act here. He is definitely on a tightrope, I think.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:41.020]   So if we pull 9 trillion out, we've been talking about this deficit, if he starts selling all of
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.900]   those assets, does that mean on the United States balance sheet that will reduce our national debt?
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:52.840]   No. I mean, we're getting 9 trillion of cash, right? You sell an asset, you get cash for it.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.980]   Right. And so-
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.080]   So it pulls money out of the economy in the same way that-
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.160]   Pulls money out of the economy.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.200]   It created liquidity when they were buying assets, right? When they were buying
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.640]   this debt, it would push money out. If they're selling the debt, it pulls money back in.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.160]   What happens to those dollars is my point. Like, what is the impact of those dollars sitting around
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.480]   in the United States bank account?
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.920]   The dollar stays in the USA's bank account, but the obligation, the note,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.680]   exists in some financial intermediary that holds it.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.780]   Clearly, Powell does not want to be remembered as the Fed chief that let
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:32.140]   inflation slip the leash, right? I mean, he's gotten religion now around the
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:36.580]   idea that this inflation is not transitory, which was his position for months. I think
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.680]   that now bit him, and the risk is potentially an overcorrection, but he's not going to let inflation-
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.500]   Then he'll be the first Fed governor to have caused two recessions.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:50.200]   I think it's like a serious risk. And by the way, these market levels that we're
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:55.540]   at right now, I mean, look, 60% correction in growth stocks, okay? But this is with,
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:01.360]   that's still in a good economy in peacetime conditions. And now we have a risk of recession
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.080]   and war. Yeah.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.260]   So, you know, there's still room for, you know, a lot more negative news here,
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:14.500]   is kind of my point. But look, sentiment's also very negative. So, when sentiment is this negative,
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:19.540]   there's also the potential for markets to quickly recover if there's positive news.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.020]   But the sentiment is there for the wrong reasons, I think. I don't think people are thinking
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.520]   recession. I think people are thinking, my gosh, these rate increases, my gosh, I can't own these
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.020]   high growth stocks anymore. And none of those things are true. Those are just perceptions that
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.960]   are amplified by one's emotions when you're getting punched in the face,
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.920]   which is what happens when you wake up every day and your portfolio is down 5 or 6%.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.620]   It generates incredible opportunity.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:50.860]   The, you know, the idea that markets bucket, quote unquote, growth stocks together, I think,
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:57.160]   kind of obfuscates an important point, which is that some of the businesses in that category are
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.960]   real businesses that are going to succeed over the long run. And some of them are speculative and are,
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:07.660]   you know, likely to fail over the short run. And, you know, as you saw Netflix sell off,
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.380]   Bill Ackman, very smart, came in and bought a bunch of the stock. I don't know if you guys
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:16.660]   remember this, but in 2011, TCV, which is traditionally a private equity investor at
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.520]   the time, and there wasn't a lot of crossover and public market stuff happening. They were a private
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:31.000]   investor in Netflix. Netflix stock tanked from, I think it was around $220 a share down to $70 a share
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:31.900]   in a couple of months. And then, you know, they went into a lot of trouble. And then, you know,
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:32.380]   they went into a lot of trouble. And then, you know, they went into a lot of trouble. And then,
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.820]   TCV did a $200 million pipe into Netflix. And everyone was like, Oh, my God, what are they
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:42.280]   doing? It's incredible. And by the way, that was on an adjusted basis, that's $10 a share in today's
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:49.420]   share price. So that that that $200 million investment that they made went up 60x. You know,
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:54.760]   at the peak of Netflix a few weeks ago. And so, you know, seeing Bill Ackman come in and underwrite
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:00.460]   Netflix again, and make a big investment at its current market price. So Jay Hogue, I think it
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.840]   is really highlights that there are
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.240]   just because the market prices down doesn't mean that a business isn't fundamentally valuable and
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.860]   going to grow and going to generate significant returns over time as a as an operating business.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:17.080]   And that distinction starts to present significant opportunities in a market condition like this.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.760]   And the businesses we all talk about generally growth stocks are down 60%. But maybe most of
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.820]   them shouldn't have even been public companies in the first place. Maybe they should have been
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.780]   speculative, private investments, where more than two thirds of them were likely to fail,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.780]   and they shouldn't be failing as public companies. And the few that are
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:37.480]   getting damaged and hit with this market sentiment shift can be picked up cheap. And there's a lot of
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.200]   opportunity. And so I wouldn't view the market condition to be necessarily reflective again,
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.900]   of the economy, or the condition of businesses in general,
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.580]   Jay Hogue was a partner at TCV. He's the founder of TCV that did that deal. And he's also the one
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:55.960]   that participated and led the billion dollar round into Peloton before they whiffed earnings.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:01.720]   And got and got decapitated, but he's an incredible investor, that trade is probably one of the best trades of all times.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.240]   So let's look in the good news column.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:13.600]   wages way up. earnings way up. 10 million job openings in the United States, pretty close to
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:19.300]   record low unemployment, and the pandemic ending ending and people having record savings in their
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:24.340]   bank accounts and personal balance sheets. So how does all that good news the pandemic hasn't ended,
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:28.660]   it's ending for people, I think it's over for people. I'll tell you the thing I'm most concerned
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.660]   about there's a reverberation. That that.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:38.740]   persists in supply chains. I don't know how much hardware, lab biotech, consumer goods businesses
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:43.420]   you guys are involved in. I'm involved in a number of them. Every single one of them are crippled in
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.740]   some way right now by supply chain issues. I mean, I'm talking about like, businesses that have been
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:52.540]   operating at steady state for many, many years. Can't get those get worked out. We don't know.
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.860]   And everyone's getting surprised and hit upside the head every week with some new supply chain
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.600]   shortage, whether it's some chemical you need for some lab equipment, or you know, the delivery
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.120]   of some big piece of equipment, or even plastic bottles that we use to kind of fill up our
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.800]   beverages that we ship. That's a pretty sizable business. We've never had supply chain disruption
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.760]   like we're seeing right now. I'd like to bleep out the name of that company. Yeah, beep. But it but
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.520]   it's it's like it's bleep this out. But it's a significantly sized business that has never had
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:27.520]   supply chain issues. It's all us based. But some of the suppliers of the suppliers have had complete
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.540]   failure and delivery. And all of a sudden, it's now reverberating through the supply chain. You guys
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.800]   know that GM didn't deliver a single friggin electric vehicle last quarter, because they
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.480]   couldn't actually get the chips that they needed to make cars. So the real risk to the economy,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.560]   in my opinion, right now, is when and how we're going to work our way through the supply chain
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.760]   issues. And it is so complex. And there's a myriad of problems. And it is a global problem,
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.200]   that it's really unclear how this is going to play out over the next six months. And what will happen
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.760]   is this quarter next quarter, businesses that you didn't realize and didn't expect are going
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.480]   to get hit with supply chain problems are suddenly going to say, guess what, our revenues
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:06.220]   are going to go off by 2030%. Because we couldn't sell this product because and half our shelves are
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:09.940]   empty, because product didn't show up or whatever the narrative might be. All right.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:16.300]   So I think it's a really, I think it's a great point, because you don't solve the supply chain
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:21.220]   issues with rate hikes. Right? It's like nothing to do with that. Nothing to do with it. So the
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.640]   rate hikes slow the economy down. I'm way more worried about this than rate hikes.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:31.420]   Right? What does clean it up is capitalism, the end of the pandemic time, unless
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.680]   you're interested in and the reason I'm less worried is when you actually talk to the companies
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.540]   that that are spending enormous amounts of money on capex, they've actually guided to the fact that
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.900]   by the end of this year, in the beginning of next year, most of these things will be worked out.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.840]   It's indigestion. I think I think we're I think we're dealing with a,
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.060]   you know, six to nine month issue of having turned things off. And now we're now rapidly
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:57.160]   trying to turn things back on. And we can't necessarily get that timing, right. But I do
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.060]   think it'll work itself out faster than people expect. Personally, that's what I think because the
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:06.280]   Apple and Tesla specifically guiding to that is too enormous. You're talking about, you know,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.000]   collectively almost 4 trillion of market cap, so they're not going to get something like this wrong.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.180]   And they were pretty clear in the last few days that that this will be done by 2023. Early 2023.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.900]   So, Saxe Orchamoth, I just listed all the good news to counter,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:26.680]   you know, the the slog and the bad news. How do you account for record low unemployment,
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.300]   record number of jobs, record wages going up, massive cash on people's personal
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   balance sheet, massive amounts of sideline cash, massive amounts of venture funds being raised that
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:42.280]   have to be deployed in the next five years. All that good news, where does that on this balance
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.100]   sheet of good versus bad, you know, work out for you, Saxe?
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:49.960]   Well, the the negatives are that yes, the unemployment rate is very low, but a lot of
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:55.240]   people have dropped out of the labor force. So the labor participation rate is still quite low.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.440]   So because of?
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.240]   Well, because I think a lot of people dropped out because of COVID, you know, everyone went
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:07.000]   to vote. And I think, you know, they got these STEMI checks. And I think a lot of people got used
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.400]   to not working. You know, maybe maybe you had a household with two people used to work. And now
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.700]   only one of them is working, you know, maybe they moved to a cheaper part of the country.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:22.000]   So I mean, maybe it's a good thing, right? But a lot of people dropped out of the labor force,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.740]   and they haven't come back. And so that's the negative. And then you know, the fact that wages
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:31.180]   are going up is good, but we don't know how much that's inflation. Right? So, you know,
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:37.120]   those would be the negatives. But there was a report that inventory levels did rise
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:45.640]   in q4. And so the supply chain issues do seem to be ameliorating to some totally, I was looking at
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:51.160]   cars. And now a lot of the people who had, you know, there's no way to get this car. Now they're
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.480]   like, Hey, we got a couple of these cars available if you want them. And then if you look at the
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:00.220]   housing inventory, it does seem that maybe that's taking a plus two and people couldn't find houses.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.120]   And now maybe,
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:04.420]   even though it's still a housing crisis, maybe there's more available, or they're staying on
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.780]   the market a little bit longer. Yeah, I mean, it's I think it's pretty clear that economic activity
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:14.680]   is slowing. And again, things like rate increases, they, it increases the cost of a mortgage, right?
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:20.380]   So that could affect house prices. I think there's an interesting startup story.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:26.620]   There's a private company that's doing essentially life extension that a bunch
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:31.060]   of rich people put $3 billion into you want to tell us Friedberg and your science,
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.240]   segment, what is this going to make us live longer or not?
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:43.180]   Well, I think I mentioned this company a few episodes ago. But I think they just announced
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:52.660]   their $3 billion investment. And again, this goes back to the the point I made on the prediction
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:57.940]   show. So last week, Altos Labs announced that they've landed $3 billion in funding. And this has
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.580]   been an ongoing funding that's been going on for
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:08.080]   quite a while into this business. But this business was set up to commercialize Yamanaka
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:14.800]   factor based cellular reprogramming for age reversal. And there was a paper published just
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:19.540]   yesterday. I'll put a link in the show notes that if people are interested in reading a scientific
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:26.500]   paper, they can take a look. Incredible results. Scientists took mice, gave those mice short bursts
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.520]   of these Yamanaka factors, and then measured all the biomarkers, all of the chemical,
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.560]   signatures in the blood of those mice to determine their age, because there are known ways that we can
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.220]   measure the age of an organism by looking in their blood at measuring certain biomarkers.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:43.000]   And with just a few short bursts for about a week of these drugs, these,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.720]   these Yamanaka factors, the mice, all of their age signals reversed to making it look like they were
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:54.460]   very young again. And it did not do what the challenge has been with Yamanaka factors in
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:57:00.460]   the past is if you put too much of it in a body in an organism, the cells rejuvenate to becoming stem
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.620]   cells, which is kind of like what a fetus might have, and starts to grow a lot of tumors, they
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:10.660]   were able to avoid having tumors show up in the mice. And the mice, in fact, all looked extremely
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.940]   young from a biomarker basis. So an incredible result and incredible paper, whether or not it
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:21.040]   gets repeated and shown by others. But I think this speaks to the quality of the science that's
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.300]   underlying the $3 billion investment that was just made in Altos Labs, which is probably one of the
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.920]   biggest seed investments ever. No, it clearly is the biggest seed investment ever in a startup.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.060]   I think it speaks to what I highlighted as what I what will be the new frontier in biotech,
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:39.040]   and we'll completely rewrite like, you know, the course of humanity is if we can take drugs and
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.820]   for a short period of time completely reverse the age of ourselves, and it sounds so crazy,
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.500]   and so wacky. But it's being now proven in a single week, we've now had an amazing paper
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:51.940]   published. And we've seen the startup announced their $3 billion of funding to pursue commercialization
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.240]   of this technology. And this is going to be the year I think this will be the front cover of a
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.700]   lot of magazines this year, as people realize that this is real, and that it's getting commercialized.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:07.780]   Why? Why do you think they have to start with $3 billion? And I'll tell you why I asked the
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:13.540]   question. Yeah. Whenever I see these grandiose prognostications of future progress, and then
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:19.540]   see these companies raise exorbitant amounts of money. I have never found a single example where
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:24.820]   it's ever worked ever. In fact, every time I see a company raise an exorbitant amount of money in a
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:30.820]   day, I write them off in my head. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So why should I not in this case? So,
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.440]   or it's more actually actually better question, why would somebody listening to this pod go work
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.780]   there? And by the way, by the way, the same has been done and can be said about calico,
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.100]   which is alphabet subsidiary that's that's pursuing similar research, where billions of
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:50.500]   dollars have gone into that business. And there's a similar sort of research track underway. And I
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:54.520]   think the general principle Chamath is they don't know what the product is, they don't know the way
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.120]   to market. And they don't know what the product is. And they don't know what the product is. And
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:00.820]   they don't know, you know, what area they need to explore. But the underlying principle is proven,
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.540]   the underlying principle is something that people believe in. This science is proven,
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.140]   this science is real, we don't know the commercial path. And we have to try lots
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:12.040]   of different things and run lots of different research programs in parallel to figure it out.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:16.660]   And each of those research programs is like $100 million biotech startup. And so I think
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:22.420]   that the principle is, let's put a lot of shots on goal, all at once in parallel and make sure
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.060]   because if any of these shots on goal work, this is going to be
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:28.840]   worth many, many billions of dollars. So I think that's generally the idea. It's almost like having
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:34.540]   a $3 billion venture fund. But the venture fund is targeted at one core area of interest that we
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.960]   believe is real. And I think that's the way a lot of these things are being set up.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:42.520]   But I'm asking this question, have you ever seen a company try to do 30 different things and it works?
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.200]   No, no.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:49.600]   Yeah, I mean, it's not the typical capital allocation milestone based funding scheme. I
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:55.000]   have a product market fit thing, right? It's, it's a it's a research program. And it's a series of
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.340]   research programs. But I mean, look, let me reframe it for you to have you ever seen a $3
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.680]   billion venture fund that makes 100 bets with smart people at the helm with smart people working
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:10.360]   at the individual businesses fail, right? Like, yes. And in fact, I've never seen a $3 billion
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.160]   venture fund do much more than return to X of money. Yeah, well, look, let's see. I mean,
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.180]   it's a it's a big bet. And obviously, there's some people making nice management fees and nice carry
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.260]   on this thing. I'm not trying to be a wet blanket. I'm just curious. You know, why do it that way?
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.940]   Meaning, you know, every startup,
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:29.080]   let's get Bob Nelson on, he'll talk about it. Yeah, so I set it up. Yeah,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:35.860]   every startup, I think, is forced in some ways by the market to make an educated guess about
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.840]   where product market fit lies and to try to build some minimum viable product that that tends to be
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.700]   how value is created. I mean, you could have said that, you know, Google could have had 90 different
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.720]   algorithms. But you know, Larry Page started with background. That's how it started. He had to make
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:54.880]   an educated guess that he had to make decisions. And that's what startups about, you have to
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.100]   make decisions and choices. Well, you have to make a bet on your on your own. Why don't you put all
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.300]   your capital into one company? Oh, because mostly the companies will let me but I would if I could.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.740]   Oh, interesting. So I think that what's happening here to I mean, you're right,
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.700]   if I could, I would but they don't let me you could buy you can put all your money back into
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.000]   Facebook or back into forget Facebook. I know you got issues. But what about alphabet or Amazon,
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.380]   just put all your capital in one bed and just, you know, write it out. Right. But then it comes
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.820]   to what I think where I can generate the best return. Meaning, you know, I think that I could
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.380]   generate much higher returns and what I think Google will give me. Yeah, that's why I do it.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:35.260]   Well, here's what I think is happening here. There are a lot of rich people who are going to die soon
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:41.920]   and they're counting down like Bezos. And they're saying if why not, if I'm worth 100 billion, put
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.860]   123 billion into this and have them go for it. Because I've got nothing to lose because I'm dying
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:53.800]   in 20 years. This is a fear of death by billionaire bet, which is exactly what I think happened with
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.760]   the Google guys. They were just
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.260]   like,
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:01.000]   the team involved in these projects are not first time founders or people that are great pitch men.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.320]   It's people that are repeated tried and true entrepreneurs success stories that have done
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.440]   this over and over in biotech. And they're the ones that are being drawn into working on these
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.920]   projects. And they're saying, Look, because we've got the people that have done it over and over,
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.260]   give them the capital. I mean, no, I believe argument,
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.820]   you must know, I believe in Yamanaka factors. And I believe that there will be innovation.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:24.700]   My only question is, is the innovation going to come through a small team that raises
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:30.640]   a small quantum of capital with one very focused idea that gets it right? Or this sort of, you know,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.560]   Monte Carlo simulation approach to product innovation. And all I'm saying is just an
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:40.840]   observation that historically, it's been very difficult for these Monte Carlo simulations to
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:46.420]   ever work either to generate product market fit and an innovation and to make money. Now,
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.900]   hopefully, these guys are the exception that proves the rule, because I think we'd all want
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.640]   this to work. No, it's a great point. And I hope you're right. And I hope to start that small project
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.700]   and wipe. But now you're saying the key thing, because despite the $3 billion, you're still going
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.680]   to go after it, which implicitly is saying, I'm short that company, and I'm long my own company.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.120]   And this is this is the point I was trying to get to, which is when when it's really,
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.280]   really smart people see these things. They tend to look at it with a grain of salt thinking it's
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.200]   very difficult to build a startup as it is. Yeah. Sometimes it's kind of like growing great wine,
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.580]   you need to have a little pain and suffering along the way.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.940]   And when you have $3 billion, it's the opposite of pain and suffering.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.860]   Totally true. And I'll also say, let me just support your point, which is the people I see
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.060]   get hired to big projects like this. And there are a number of them that get funded, not just also in
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:42.880]   in other kind of deep tech stuff. They hire the tried and true experienced executives who generally
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:48.100]   have older kids and live in a nice house and have made a bunch of money. And the earnestness,
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:54.100]   the motivation, the hunger, the fuel, the creativity, because they know what they know, and
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:54.520]   they're not willing to give up. And they're willing to give up. And they're willing to give up. And
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.540]   they're willing to accept that they don't know what they don't know. Those folks generally are
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.520]   less likely to succeed than the folks who are doing this maybe for the first time. For that
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.140]   very reason when you're doing something innovative, so I totally support your point. And, and I really
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.500]   do hope you're right. But I thought Jason, when you were talking about talking about startups,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.820]   I thought we were gonna talk about bolt and the stripe mafia fiasco this well, that's a good story.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:21.640]   It's a pretty crazy story. Where does everyone follow? What side does everyone fall out on that?
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.460]   I'll go on the record. Does anybody have any equity positions in either company?
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.780]   Let's start there. No, no.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.100]   Stripe holders. No.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:27.820]   Sacks. No.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.540]   Sacks. Are you an LP in any firms that have a exposure?
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.900]   I am an LP. I am an LP in funds that have exposure to it. Absolutely.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.440]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.120]   I am an LP in a fund that has exposure.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.800]   I am as well. I am as well. But it doesn't.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.300]   It's minuscule. That doesn't affect.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.260]   Minuscule. Doesn't matter.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:45.700]   Minuscule for me too. Okay, here we go. So for people who don't know, Bolt is like one
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:49.420]   click checkout software. They compete in some ways with Stripe's payment API.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:54.400]   The CEO, Ryan Breslow, did a tweet thread,
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.860]   basically saying that YC and Stripe are the mob bosses of Silicon Valley. It was pretty charged.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:07.060]   Obviously, Stripe and YC work together. Stripe is the biggest company to come out of YC ever,
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:13.840]   I guess, along with Airbnb. He claims that a lot of the top VCs were blocked as a strategy
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.460]   by Stripe. And I think there is some truth to this. When you invest in one company, you don't
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.980]   invest in the competitor. I don't know if that happened here as a strategy, but it is a viable
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:29.320]   strategy. I think that's what other people have used where Bolt claims Stripe got all the top
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.940]   investors, therefore they couldn't raise money. He also was saying they were voting things up and
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:41.680]   down on Y Combinator's Hacker News, as if that matters, yada, yada, yada. It was kind of a weak
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.840]   argument, in my view. I'll give you my hot take.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.300]   It then resulted in a bunch of VCs dunking on him.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.320]   Hold on. I'll give you my hot take. So first of all, Bolt is now a $14 billion company or
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.280]   something. Okay? So these guys… I think this was a very, very…
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:01.240]   Very brilliant PR strategy, and it worked. What do I mean by this? This was a company that most
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.980]   people didn't know about until this past week. They went and they punched up, which is a pretty
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.960]   tried and true PR strategy. Always fight up.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   Always fight up. You pick the big guy who's an incredibly pristine, extremely well-run company
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:20.620]   that is sucking up most of the talented people in Silicon Valley to work for, is a centicorn,
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.220]   could be a trillion-dollar company over some lifetime. So
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:30.820]   they went and they punched up, and what happened? Everybody fell for it. They baited all of these
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:35.620]   folks, and then all of these folks had to come out on Twitter and lambast them. And basically,
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:40.720]   the net result of it is, if one person knew about Bolt before, now hundreds and thousands of people
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.340]   know about Bolt afterwards. So not only do they not know them, now they're contemporary.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.360]   Just in terms of the practical reality, they are now part of a discussion
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.160]   and in a framework of companies in this space that they were never a part of,
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:00.460]   before. This is Steve Jobs' move with the 1984 commercial. He said, "IBM and then Microsoft,
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:04.660]   our big brother, we're going to attack them. Join the Rebel Alliance, be part of Apple." And of
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:10.000]   course, Apple and IBM responded, and that was the big mistake. And Marc Andreessen, Sequoia,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.100]   a bunch of different venture firms responded. Sax, what's your take on this? I see you're
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.680]   chomping at the bit, or maybe you're biting your tongue, which is-
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:24.100]   No. So I agree with Jamath that it was kind of a brilliant PR move, if that's what it was. I do
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.720]   think startups punching up, and he took a punch at Stripe, which is the big company in the space.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.820]   So, and then, yeah, Stripe didn't respond directly. The Coulsons didn't respond,
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.260]   but their surrogates did. And then that looks like punching down, and it draws more attention to it.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.520]   So I get the PR strategy. I would say that as to the merits of the allegation,
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.200]   I do, it's interesting that, you know, he didn't get into YC,
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:54.040]   because I think that he is a very talented founder. And, you know, we looked at this company
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:59.980]   pretty, yeah, pretty early on. It was for like sort of a mid-stage growth round. And it was like
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:05.920]   one of the toughest decisions we, we, I'd say the toughest decisions as a VC are when you actually
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:12.820]   want to invest in the company, but the valuation is like 2X what you think it should be. And that
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:17.320]   was kind of the situation at the time when we looked at it is, I think we actually would have
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.960]   invested, it's just the valuation was too high. So-
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.220]   And it would have been a great bet for you.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.980]   Yeah, he grew into it. And so it would have been a great bet.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.020]   So it was a bad decision on your part.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:30.940]   Yeah, yeah, clearly we should have invested. It's just that, you know, at the time you invest,
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.820]   you have to have some basis for valuation. And that's the sense in which I think, you know,
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:44.200]   maybe Ryan's accusations don't totally make sense is that he's been able to raise a lot of rounds at
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:51.280]   really high valuations. And so he hasn't had a problem, you know, raising a lot of money at,
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.920]   you know, great prices. And, you know,
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.060]   it almost feels like a slap in the face to his investors where, like, what's the complaint? I
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.500]   didn't get any tier one investors.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.420]   Or that it was just hard to meet with investors and that Stripe called the investors and told
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.460]   them not to invest. That was the allegation.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:13.360]   Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I can't really speak to that. But I mean, he was clearly able to raise
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.800]   great rounds. So-
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.580]   Can I read to you an email exchange between me and Ryan Breslow?
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.380]   Oh, dramatic reading?
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.460]   From 2015.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.660]   Uh-oh, here we go.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.860]   Hitch Moth hopes.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:29.560]   All's well. FYI, things felt too rushed on our end, so we're toning down our series A discussions
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:37.480]   for a couple months. And this was in July of 2015. I'm reading you my answer because it's so fabulous.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.940]   Hi, Ryan. After a wholly unsuccessful few weeks of attempting to win a World Series
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:49.000]   of Poker bracelet, I'm back at home licking my moons. How about we talk in a week or two?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.800]   So not only did I have a chance to win a World Series of Poker bracelet, according to this
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.300]   page, which I didn't win, obviously.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:55.780]   Duh.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.940]   I had a chance to do the Series A in a $14 billion company and screwed that one up too.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:06.760]   Big dummies. I mean, the things we miss are, there's like 20 things you miss as an investor
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.720]   for everything you hit.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.100]   So I've interacted with Ryan back in the day, and I just remember him being super,
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:17.980]   super smart. And I do think that there's a lot of very smart people now around the table at Bolt,
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:23.140]   including Joanne Bradford. So I don't think that this was something that wasn't planned, and I just
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:23.740]   think that they executed it. And I think that they executed it. And I think that they executed it.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.280]   Executed it well, and it worked. And I think a lot of people know this company that didn't know
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.020]   before. Now they still have to execute and build a product and scale it and do all of these things.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:36.940]   But yeah, and I think that the response he provoked, I mean, since I was a little bit
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:43.180]   critical of what he said, let me just say that one of the VCs who responded said that the reason
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.320]   they didn't invest was because the numbers weren't good. That was not my experience. When we looked
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.160]   at this company, they had great numbers. It's just the valuation was ahead of those numbers,
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.600]   but the numbers were always great.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.680]   I actually responded
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.420]   to that. And that was Sequoia partner Sean McGuire who said that. And I responded to him like,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:04.840]   "Hey, dude, VC code is you don't reveal the numbers on things you learn confidentially.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.700]   What are you doing?" And he's like, "Well, they said some BS about Stripe." I was like,
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.920]   "Yeah, it still doesn't change VC code that if you learn something under NDA for NDA essentially
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.180]   in a meeting, you're not supposed to weaponize that against-"
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.640]   Unless you have a $30 billion position.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.620]   I still think, well, whatever. I still
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:27.820]   think it's like I've never seen a VC do that. Honestly, it's the first time I've ever seen a VC
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.120]   do that.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:33.760]   Jason, come on. I think we all knew where he was coming from. He's defending an enormous position
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.480]   of his in Sequoias.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.100]   You do that, Jason. You've always been-
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.820]   Air Cal.
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.660]   Air Cal.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.560]   Air Cal's fine, but I never released inside information is my point.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.580]   You didn't say any inside information.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.840]   I didn't have any inside information.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.880]   He made a general statement.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.900]   He made a general statement.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.740]   They met with them.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.080]   But he was conflicted out. So why would he meet with them?
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.420]   Hey, guys, Nick just texted that had I found a way to get off my lazy ass,
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.920]   not be playing poker and do that deal, I would have generated a 222X on my investment.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.980]   Which would have been 15 million times 222X.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:07.420]   Well, we screwed it up too. I think the round we looked at went at like a $400 million valuation
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.400]   or something like that or something in that range.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.060]   Oh my gosh. What would the Series A have been? I mean, the Series A would have been at like 20
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:13.540]   or something.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.040]   63 million according to PitchBook.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.720]   Oh, 63 million.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.960]   You know, it was one of those meetings we came out of where it's like,
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.020]   that's the best I've ever seen. That's the best I've ever seen. That's the best I've ever seen.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.280]   That's a super interesting founder.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.160]   Yeah, me too. That's what I remember too from Ryan.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.840]   Super, super, super.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.460]   That is the lesson. Super interesting founder, write the check.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:31.720]   I said it earlier in the program that like our philosophy now is just to be price takers and
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.080]   just to pick the companies that we want to be in and then the market sets the price.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.440]   That's the biggest mistakes I've made as an investor. I got too focused on price.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.780]   We should have done that with Bolt. The decision we faced was like a few years ago. And so we just
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.860]   shouldn't have worried about valuation.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:49.300]   By the way, sorry, J. Cal, as soon as you said it was 63 million, you know what my reptilian brain
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:49.960]   said? Oh, that feels good.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.860]   It feels so expensive. Even now, knowing that the outcome is 14 billion.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:59.320]   And so to your point, David, it's a really good lesson for investors to learn is just
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.120]   you're a price taker. Get behind these really interesting people that are world beaters and
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.020]   just let them do the work.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.820]   Just place the bet. All right. So there you have it. This has been another amazing episode
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.260]   of the All In Podcast.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:11.920]   Bye-bye.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.120]   Bye-bye.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.200]   Love you, besties.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.960]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.900]   Rain Man, David Sack.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.900]   I'm going all in.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:27.580]   And instead we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. Love you, Westby.
