[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, today is Good Friday in the annual church calendar.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We celebrate the death of our Savior, Jesus Christ, on the cross,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   absorbing the wrath that our sins deserved.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It's a huge day, it's a huge week. Easter is just a few days away this weekend.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And so we turn our attention today on the podcast to the resurrection of Christ.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And this question is from a listener named Allison.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast. Thanks to the death
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   and resurrection of Christ, we have the hope of physical resurrection to come,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   an amazing reality, but one off in the future.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It seems that the Apostle Paul also talks about some ways in which we now participate
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   in the resurrection of Christ. Can you explain these to me? Particularly,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I'm thinking of when Paul says that we can know the power
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   of Christ's resurrection in our lives today.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   That's Philippians 3.10. And then he also says that God raised us
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly places
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   in Christ Jesus. That's in Ephesians 2.6.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   So can you explain both of these implications of Easter for our lives today?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Well, the effect of Christ's resurrection
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   on our present life as Christians is,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Tony, Allison, immeasurably
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   great. Yes. I mean, none of us has
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   exhausted the possibilities of what God may
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   be willing to do in us and through us because
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   of the power of the resurrection of Christ in us.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And I say that because Paul said
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   in Ephesians 3.20, God is able to do
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   far more abundantly than all that we ask or think
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   according to the power
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   at work within us. And he identified that power
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   in chapter 1 this way. The
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   immeasurable greatness of his power toward
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   us who believe that he worked in
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Christ when he raised him from the dead. So there's the
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   connection between 3.20 and 1.19.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   The power that makes it possible for us to do far
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   more abundantly than we even dream we could is the very
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   power of God that he worked when he raised Christ
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   from the dead. So Allison's question is like plugging
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   an electric cord into a socket with 10,000
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   volts. So how does the Bible
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   spell this out? It starts by
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   teaching us that what happened to us in our
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   conversion to Christ, in our new birth,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   is that by faith we were spiritually
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   united to Jesus Christ.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   God established a bond,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   a union, a living, unbreakable attachment
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   to Jesus Christ. And the point of this
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   union, this bond, was that
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Christ's death and Christ's resurrection
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   would count as our death and our resurrection.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And the key text is Romans 6.5.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   If we have been united with him
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   in a death like his, we shall certainly
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   be united with him in a resurrection
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   like his. And so if you ask,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   "How do we experience this union with Christ?"
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Because I can imagine there would be listeners who say, "Whoa.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Okay, you say we're united. I don't know where to look
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   in my experience for that." If you ask, "How do I
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   personally experience a union with Christ
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   in his death, in his resurrection?" the biblical answer is
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   by faith in Christ. When the Holy
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Spirit brings about your embrace
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   of Christ, your believing in Jesus Christ as
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Savior and Lord and treasure of your life, that is his way
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   of establishing the union between you
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and the risen Christ. We see this in, for example,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Galatians 2.20. "I have been crucified
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   with Christ." So there's the union. "I have been united
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   with Christ in his dying. It is no
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   longer I who live, but Christ, the risen Christ,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   who lives in me." And now here comes
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   the conscious experience of that, as Paul describes it.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   "And the life I now live in the flesh
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I live by faith in the Son of God."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So by faith, the cord
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   of our lives is plugged in to the 10,000-volt
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   That secures our future resurrection.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   "If the Spirit of him," this is Romans 6,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   no, Romans 8, "If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   from the dead dwells in you, he who raised
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   our mortal bodies." So if Christ is in you now, the
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   risen Christ dwelling in you now, you will be raised
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   from the dead. So here are five present
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   implications or experiences that we
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   can know here and now because of our
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   1,000-volt union with the risen
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Christ and the certainty of our own resurrection.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   What a difference it makes in our hearts that we can be certain that
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   our own future resurrection is going to happen. So here's number one.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   There is a new security, a new confidence of hope in
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   our lives. Christians are in a profound sense
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   immortal. We will never see the full
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   destructive power of death because Jesus said,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   this is John 11:25, "I am the resurrection and
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   the life. Everyone who lives and believes in me
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   shall never die." Amazing.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Oh, what a promise. The effect of this
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   certainty in the future is to make our present
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   experience in this world joyful, a joyful
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   freedom from fear and a full
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   security and confidence and hope. Peter said,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   this is 1 Peter 1.3, "God caused us
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   to be born again to a living hope
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   All of us know there's a world of difference
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   between living right now in despair and uncertainty
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and insecurity and fear and, on the other hand,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   living right now in security and confidence
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and hope and joy and freedom from fear because we
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   share an indestructible life, namely
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   the resurrection life of Jesus. So that's the first effect
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   of Christ's resurrection on our present
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   experience. Here's number two. We have a new
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   unshakable, glorious identity.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   The world looks at you, me,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   after our conversion to Christ, and what do they
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   see? Nothing very spectacular. You're not
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   100 feet tall. Your true life
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is hidden. Son of God.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I mean, son of God, that's like a galaxy.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Your true life is hidden. Listen to Colossians
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   3.3. "You have died, and your life
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   is hidden with Christ, the risen
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Christ, in God." That's where you are. That's who you
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   are. "When Christ, who is your life, appears,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   then you, the real you,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   will appear." That is, will be finally manifest to the
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   world. You will be 100 feet tall. "With him in glory."
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   In union with the risen Christ, you are not a mere
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   mortal. Your true identity as a child of God
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   is hidden with Christ in God, and it will be
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   manifest in spectacular glory at his
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   coming. Number three. In union with the risen
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Christ, we have a new, living,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   present friend helping us all the
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   time. Jesus said to his disciples before
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   he died, "I will not leave you
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   as orphans. I will come to you." John 14
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   18. And at the end of the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   the very last verse, "Behold, I
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   will be with you always to the
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   end of the age." So we experience
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   the presence of the risen Christ
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   by his Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   When John said in John 7 39, before Jesus died
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and rose, John, describing the situation,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   said, "The Spirit had not been given
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   because Jesus was not yet glorified."
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Not yet raised and glorified.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I think what he meant was not
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   that the Holy Spirit was not at work in the world before the resurrection of Jesus,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   but that the Spirit had not
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   been revealed or experienced or known
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   as the Spirit of the risen Christ
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   himself. That's what's new. That's our Christian
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   privilege. The risen Christ is in us,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   with us, as our friend, our helper, all the time,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   all the way home. Number four, in union
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   with the risen Christ, there is new power
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   for defeating sin and walking in
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   righteousness. And the key text is Romans 6.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Indeed, just about the whole chapter and the first part of chapter 7 is all about
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   this. Here's verse 4. "Just as Christ
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   was raised from the dead, we too
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   walk in newness of life." Right now,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   not just later. Verse 13. "Do not
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   present your members"—that is, your tongue, your arms, your legs, your
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   sexual organs, your eyes, your ears—"don't present your members to
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   present yourselves to God"—here it is—
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "as those who have been brought
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   from death to life." And here's Romans
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   7, verse 4. "You belong to him who has been
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   for God." So in union with the risen Christ,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   we have a new power for holiness
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   and love. And here's number five, the last point, and there
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   are lots more. This is a rich,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   rich—I mean, we're plugged into mega-voltage here. So number
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   five, in union with the risen Christ, there is a
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   new power to suffer with Jesus.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Allison asked about this one in particular.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Philippians 3.10, "that I may know him
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   and the power of his resurrection." Why?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Here comes the answer. "That I may share his sufferings,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   becoming like him in his death."
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   We have power to suffer well
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   with Jesus. A new security and confidence of hope,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   a new unshakable, glorious identity, a
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   new present friend helping us
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   all the time, all the way home, a new power for holiness
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and love, a new power to suffer with Jesus.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And so we say this Easter season, don't we, Tony?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The Lord is risen. He is risen indeed. And so
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   in him are we. Amen.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. Everyone have a wonderful weekend, enjoying what Christ has done for us
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and in us through his resurrection. We'll see you on
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Monday.
