[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. As always, I'm joined by Duncan Hill.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.880]   Duncan, thanks for making it. We get a ton of questions from people on YouTube and
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.680]   our inbox. Sometimes the questions are topical, sometimes they're evergreen,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.200]   but we have a very intelligent audience, right? So great question. So let's get in.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.520]   So remember, our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com if you have a question for us.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.720]   Let's do one. - Okay. First up today, we have, "Technology has made investing easier with
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.360]   indexing, direct indexing, robo-advisors, etc. With AI in vogue right now, what does the RIA
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.240]   and financial planning space look like in another 20 to 30 years? Will there still be a human need
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.800]   to hold your hand or talk you off the ledge? Or will the only human interactions be those...
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.680]   Sorry, we lost it there. Will be those maintaining the tech behind the scenes?"
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.280]   - All right. I love this question. There were similar questions asked when robo-advisors came
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   out. It was kind of like, "Is financial advisor still necessary here?" And AI is not robo-advisors,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.680]   right? This is a whole other thing. Obviously, no one knows how AI will transform our lives,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.040]   but speculation is just running rampant now because of all the chat GPT stuff.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.840]   The possibilities seem endless. There's tons of speculation from people. I think this is
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.800]   the fun stage of innovation where people just spend all their time thinking what the future
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.680]   could look like. I do think this is one of the first major technological breakthroughs where
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.280]   people can see it immediately. The first time they try it, they say, "Oh, I get it. This makes
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.080]   sense. I've done a few demos on some of this stuff, on some ideas and startups, and it makes
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.320]   sense." So even though we don't know exactly how it's going to change our lives, how the businesses
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.920]   will use it, I think we can be sure that it's going to evolve from here. I'm going to skip over
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.360]   the Terminator end of days stuff, right? Because I don't know. That's a pretty easy one to figure
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.240]   out what the end game is. So I'm going to focus on how this could change the financial advice
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.040]   realm going forward. I do agree with you, by the way, though, just for the record,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.720]   from what you were saying on Animal Spirits yesterday. I think that the negative that is
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.800]   going to come from AI is very easily or likely going to outweigh the positive if we're not careful.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.040]   Unfortunately, there's going to be some wonderful things that come from it, I think,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.920]   especially for knowledge workers like us. Content clips, and there's going to be so many different
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.480]   things you can do, and we're going to look at one of those right now. I do think the downsides
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.600]   could be pretty drastic and scams, and I think it's just another tool of a tool belt for people
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.040]   who want to take advantage of others. So one of our loyal viewers, I don't know if he's in the
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.440]   chat today, Part-Time Larry, which is just a, it kind of sounds like a comedian's name, maybe? Like,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040]   "Oh, I'm going to see Part-Time Larry tonight." He has a YouTube channel, and it's called OpenAI
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   for Finance that's looking into some of the ideas here. He created this video, and he didn't even
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.120]   send it to us. Someone else sent it to us, and he used chat GPT to essentially create a portfolio
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.000]   rescue question and answer engine that just blew me away. Maybe we'll try to put a link in this in
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.080]   the show notes. Yeah, we'll wing to it. So he took all of the questions that we've been answered,
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.120]   he uploaded them somehow, and he created this financial advice box, basically, where you ask
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.400]   a question, and it would spit out an answer based on how we've answered questions here in the past.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.880]   So it's essentially a portfolio rescue AI. And the whole thing that he... I didn't get all the
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.040]   technical aspects of what he was explaining, but it did kind of blow me away. And we're still in
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   the early innings of this stuff here, right? This stuff is only going to get better and more useful,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.080]   and I was blown away by the stuff he could do when we're still in like the first inning of this
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.360]   stuff. So I love the idea of having an archive of my blog or any of the podcasts and giving people
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.480]   the ability to search seamlessly for charts and graphs and data and answer and context and even
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.520]   movie recommendations. So if Larry's listening, my next AI request for him would be, people always
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.600]   ask us for Animal Spirits, "Do you have a list of all your movie and TV show recommendations
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.120]   somewhere?" No, that'd be way too hard for us and too much of a pain in the butt. But if AI could
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   do it, that'd be great. All of Michael's horrible movie recommendations and my wonderful TV movie
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.520]   recommendations. So maybe AI can help there too. So the question is, will everyone have their own
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.040]   AI financial advisor someday that executes a financial plan on their behalf? It wouldn't
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   surprise me if something like that existed someday. It certainly makes a lot of sense.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.280]   Do we need John Connor to go back in time to save financial advisors and kill this technology
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.200]   before it gets off the ground? I would actually go the other way here. I think if AI lives up to
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.560]   its promise, I think it's just going to be a commodity that everyone has access to. And that
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.480]   only increases the value of human advice, right? So Howard Lindzen, friend of the show, likes to
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.440]   say that there's no such thing as information overload, only filter failure. And I think if AI
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.160]   ends up becoming this subtotal of human knowledge on the internet that has this interactive format,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.240]   then the best advisors are going to be the ones that were able to filter out the best uses of it,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.000]   make their lives more efficient and make things, make tools better for their clients to use it in
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.960]   concert with that technology. So I think it's like a compliment to good advisors. So I think
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.880]   that's always been the case, advisors who are able to use the newest technology. So the thing about
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.680]   financial advice is there is no black or white or right or wrong for most of the big decisions,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   right? What's the right asset allocation for me? Well, it depends. What's the safe withdrawal rate
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   for my portfolio? Well, it depends. Should I invest this extra money or put it into paying
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.120]   off my mortgage? Well, it depends. There's so many different questions you can kind of
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.000]   go down that path and say, it depends, it depends, it depends, right? And so I think good
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   financial advisors know how to mix probabilities, statistics, and financial data with a little bit
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.560]   of common sense and empathy and behavioral psychology. So I think the value of a good
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.840]   financial advisor is always going to come down to things like trust and effective communication
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.160]   and setting realistic expectations and just having a deep understanding of your clients and
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.600]   diagnosing problems before you give a prescription. And so I think still having that ability to help
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.240]   people through tough parts of their life or good parts of their life, the birth of a child,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040]   the death of a spouse, divorce, retirement, loss of a job, big purchases, market crashes,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.240]   all this stuff, I still think you're going to need a human being on the other end of that to
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.160]   help see you through. Because financial planning is not just like a one-time event. You don't
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.840]   create a financial plan and that's it. It's a process that takes a while and you have to navigate
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   those decisions. And I think navigating those decisions requires a lot of compassion and
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   education and communication and just a level of trust that is difficult to establish with a piece
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.600]   of software. So I just think AI is likely going to be able to help with a lot of the technical
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.000]   financial variables going forward, but there's a huge difference between technical knowledge
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.880]   and the management of relationships. Right or wrong, people like to work with other people
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   that they respect or they trust or they just like to work with. So I still think it's silly to
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.560]   predict what's going to happen with AI right now because there's so many, most of the forecasts
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.080]   people are making right now are going to look silly in probably a few years, maybe a few months.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.600]   I think there will always be a place for financial advisors and the best ones have always known how
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.280]   to mix the best human elements with the best elements of technology. And I don't see that
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.360]   changing anytime soon. Yeah, that sounds right to me. And also, how many people are like, "Oh,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.920]   I really wish that I had a chatbot instead of a real person to talk to about fill-in-the-blank
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.800]   topic." Now, there will come a time when the AI chatbots will probably be better than the average
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.960]   human, I guess, that you would be talking to as far as support goes. But yeah, to me,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.080]   yeah, I just, I think that the human element is a pretty important part. But I mean,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.320]   we're biased, we're humans, right? So I guess if we were AI, we'd have a different opinion.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.880]   Yeah, you're asking a barber whether a robot haircutting machine, I mean, did the Flowbee
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.000]   put barbers out of business? No, right? You want that good conversation when you're sitting in the
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.920]   barber chair, right? So I do think the human element of it is, because again, a lot of the
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.000]   decisions people are forced to make about their life, there's two or three different paths that
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.440]   you could take. So I think someone that helps you make those decisions is always going to be helpful.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.960]   And I think the best experts will be the ones that can rely on this AI to help them better
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.040]   answer questions on people's behalf, and then figure out which is the right or wrong answer
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.600]   for them personally, because there are no answers that are right for everyone.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.280]   It's very circumstantial. Also, what's to stop the AI from starting to take a cut?
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.680]   You know, it's like all your transactions you suddenly start noticing aren't quite adding up.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.800]   The AI's like, "I didn't do anything. What are you going to do?"
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.080]   This is a financial scamming part. You need someone to monitor the AI to make sure they're
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.480]   not stealing all your money. All right, let's do another one.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.080]   All right, that question was from Michael, by the way. We've had a lot of Michaels writing in.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.960]   Yeah, that's true. Great, yeah. Everyone born between 1975 and 1991,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.080]   75% chance you're named Michael or John.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.320]   Right.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.040]   All right.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.200]   All right, up next we have a question from Jeff. And Jeff asks, "How far in advance do markets
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.920]   generally get things priced in? Does it change from sector to sector? The reason I ask is that
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.000]   Josh on TCAP was saying he thinks commercial real estate is the next shoe to drop. That got
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.240]   me thinking about how well the market prices stuff in."
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.840]   Easily one of the hardest questions to answer when it comes to the markets, because
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.520]   sometimes the market is forward-looking enough to price things in, right? Like when the vaccine
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.840]   got here during COVID, there was a lot of other factors at play, but markets were already back
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.160]   at all-time highs by the time the vaccine rolled out, right? But there are some times when the
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.360]   market overreacts, sometimes when it underreacts, and sometimes when it just doesn't react at all
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.880]   until it's too late. And there's an old joke, I think Paul Samuelson said it, that the stock
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.160]   market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. I wrote about this last year,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.120]   about the two different types of bear markets. So John, throw the first one up. So you have
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.560]   recessionary bear markets, which these are pretty easy. They encompass the majority of the worst
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.680]   market crashes in history. Some pretty nasty times, the Great Depression in 1973, '74 bear
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   market from inflation and bursting of the dot-com bubble, great financial crisis. That's pretty
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.680]   easy, right? Most of the bear markets in history are associated with an economic downturn, which
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.880]   makes sense. But there have also been plenty of bear markets that have taken place outside
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.960]   of recessions. So we have the non-recessionary bear markets too, right? And some of these
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.280]   happened for legitimate reasons, but some of these happened just because the market decided
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.000]   to overreact, and there was no real reason there. And it's not like the market... In 1987,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.480]   when the stock market crashed more than 20% in a single day, the next day all the headlines were
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.640]   proclaiming, "I think a Great Depression is here. The stock market has to know something." And the
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.560]   stock market recovered, and it was off to the races again for the rest of the '90s, and things
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.920]   were fine. So, John, just throw up the little summary here just for people. So the non-recessionary
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.480]   ones don't freak out as bad, which makes sense, because a lot of times they're not correlated
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   with a really nasty recession. But people can overreact. The stock market can overreact because
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.200]   people are the ones pulling the trigger, right? And you'll notice I didn't include the current
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.400]   incarnation of a bear market, because we don't really know if it'll be associated with a recession
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.960]   or not. I would say if we go into a recession in the next six to 12 months, you can count this one
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.360]   as put that in recessionary camp. If not, I think we push it out. This was a non-recessionary bear
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.000]   market. We shall see. Burton Malkiel has a quote about efficient markets that I think applies here
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.320]   in terms of thinking about what's priced in. And his quote about efficient markets is not that like
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.600]   it means the markets are always right, but he said the price is never right. In fact, prices are
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.520]   always wrong. What's right is that no one knows for sure whether they're too high or too low.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.880]   It's not that the prices are always right. It's that it's never clear that they are wrong. The
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.920]   market is very, very difficult to beat. And so I think one of the harder things to understand
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.360]   with the markets is it's not really good or bad that matters, but better or worse. And when you're
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.280]   trying to figure out what better or worse is, you are trying to answer this question about what's
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.520]   priced in. And again, that's really tough to figure out. So it does seem like commercial
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.000]   real estate is a thing people are becoming worried about. I don't know what's priced in,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.480]   because it does kind of seem like this is clear as day for a while that people aren't going back
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.880]   to the office. Big cities like New York and maybe San Francisco, their commercial office space is
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   going to be in for a world of hurt potentially. But we're talking about a $20 trillion market
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.480]   here. Some parts of commercial real estate will be fine. Other parts are probably in for a huge
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.200]   adjustment period. But the biggest question here is not only what's priced in, but how much does
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.000]   this actually impact the economy or the stock market? Maybe certain segments or investors or
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.480]   buildings are in trouble, but is that really enough to impact the entire economy? Will other
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.040]   parts of the real estate market pick up the slack, because those people have to go somewhere, right?
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   Now, these are the only answers that show why it's just so difficult to answer. And I think
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.880]   everyone thinks they know what's priced into the market at any one time, but no one really
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.080]   knows for sure. And the biggest risks are usually the ones that you don't see coming,
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.360]   like the ones that you don't see barreling down the highway. Those typically aren't the
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.200]   ones that get you. It's the ones that you don't see coming, maybe like a bank run, right? Those
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.680]   kind of things. Right, right. Yeah, efficient markets. That's some of my favorite jargon,
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.800]   you know? You start dropping that when you want people to know you know what you're talking about.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:41.520]   Well, or yeah. It's a weird argument to have, and markets are like kind of sort of efficient,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   and in that they are hard to beat. But of course, markets are irrational because humans are
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.280]   irrational. Right. All right, let's do another one. Okay. You know what won't be irrational? AI.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.040]   Yeah, not at all. I'm just picturing there has to be like a big off switch somewhere,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.320]   right? If we're headed toward the Terminator, everyone says, "Well, it'll happen before
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.920]   anyone knows it, and this thing, this sentient being will become so smart that it'll just wipe
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.800]   us all out." I just want a red button to hit off, like, "Okay, we're calling it. No more AI."
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.920]   I think we have that. I think the person controlling it, though, is Elon Musk.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.240]   Okay. All right, let's do another one. Okay. Up next, we have a question from Ryan.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.080]   "My question revolves around bailouts. I'm too young to remember how everything played out in
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.040]   2008, so this whole episode with SBB is new to me. I understand why government officials stepped in
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.760]   to avoid more bank runs, but I can't reconcile that with the fact that bailouts don't seem fair.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   How did we get here? Does every big financial institution just get bailed out in the future
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.600]   if they run into problems?" We've had a ton of questions about this. A lot of people feel like
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.080]   it's unfair. Yes. There's a lot of this going on, so why don't we bring in the guy who literally
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.480]   wrote the book on this subject, Mr. Barry Ritholtz. Hey, Barry. You wrote a book called
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.360]   Bailout Nation to kind of help people understand how we got to this place following the 2008
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.560]   financial crisis. When did this book come out again? 2009, 2010? Late 2009.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.600]   Also, I want to just give you... You have Rubini on the cover.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.560]   Crazy, right? Right? That's hilarious.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:17.200]   I love that. "A beam of enlightened thinking in a sea of delusional complacency." That could be
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:24.000]   the best blurb I've ever read. Not bad. I read this book when it came out. Correct me if I'm
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.280]   wrong, but you kind of trace this back to how it was kind of a snowball building up, starting with
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   the Chrysler bailout in the '70s, right? Before. Lockheed in 1971. It went Lockheed.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.560]   During the Vietnam War, they had run into financial problems. They took, I think it
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:50.240]   was a $250 million loan from the government. They had screwed up. Then Chrysler in 1980 was another
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:59.760]   example of it's an election year. It's a big employer. It's somebody that is located in a
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:07.520]   politically important swing state. They got a multi-billion dollar loan because they had been
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.480]   mismanaged for not just a couple of years, for decades. They eventually paid it back. It'll
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.920]   work out. Eventually Chrysler gets bought by Mercedes, who a couple of years later says,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.760]   "Why did we buy them? They're terrible." They learned how to build Jeeps and that was it. They
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:32.720]   spun them back out. The question, why are we bailing people out? I think you need to be a
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:41.120]   little nuanced in your definition of what a bailout is. First, and we could get into a lot of
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:50.000]   details, when you look at '08, '09, what happened is people who were extremely risk-embracing and
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.240]   aggressive and painted themselves into a corner, their own decision-making, their own behavior,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.800]   got them into trouble. They were made whole. To me, a bailout is when someone gets rescued
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.760]   from their own folly. People had the right to be mad about those bailouts, the way things happened
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.720]   and the way that that was structured. It did feel like, "We're going to let a lot of these homeowners
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   lose their houses and they're screwed and you're on your own, but the banks, we're going to make
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:24.720]   you whole." I think people had a right. None of those guys went to jail. Some of them probably
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.120]   should have. Some people should have gone to jail. Dick Foulds, front and center. The CEO
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:35.760]   of Lehman Brothers was engaging in a repo 105 every quarter. They were hiding all this debt
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.760]   off balance sheets so shareholders couldn't see it. A lot of bad behavior. Now, who is bailed out
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:50.400]   this time? The depositors in Silicon Valley Bank? Let me make sure I understand this. You select a
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:58.560]   top 20 bank with a 50-year track record. What recklessness or bad behavior or bad decision
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:07.440]   making did the depositors have that we have to worry about moral hazard? It's one thing when you
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:14.640]   say every bank was making a ton of money securitizing junk mortgages and they didn't
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   care about the quality of it and the thought was, "Let's just jam as much as this stuff into stuff
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.680]   and sell it back out to the market and get paid a ton of money for it." There's some moral hazard
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.360]   there. They're engaging in reckless behavior in order to profit from it. Someone who goes down
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.000]   to the corner bank and says, "Here's my $500,000. I'm running a small business and I need to do
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.440]   payroll and accounts payable and all that through this. Oh, and I'm over the $250,000 minimum."
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.600]   Sealing for FDIC. What did that guy do wrong? Right. This would have been different if the
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.960]   equity holders would have been bailed out and the bond holders would have been bailed out.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.320]   That's the kind of thing that people got mad about in a way which felt like that happened
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.200]   to a lot of banks. AIG for sure. A lot of the banks, there were rescues. Even Bear Stearns,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.560]   this was bought at $2 a share. It moved up to $10 a share. It was a very famous picture.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.040]   Someone taped a $2 bill to the Bear Stearns glass door entrance at their headquarters that went
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   viral back in the day. But that's the real question. Silicon Valley Bank,
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.440]   shareholders, zero. Wiped out. The bond holders, it's going to be somewhere between 30% and 50%.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.960]   They're going to lose a big chunk of it. That's very different than, "We're going to make you
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.400]   whole and we're going to save you from your own bad decision making."
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.240]   I think the sentiment that I can kind of relate to is I've seen people saying things like,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   in individual businesses, I think most people would make a distinction, but an individual who
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.480]   had millions of dollars in the bank, shouldn't they have known the FDIC limit? And so isn't
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.600]   that kind of them being reckless at that point? You know, if you're running a business, what are
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.080]   you going to do? I've also seen people pointing out that a lot of the same people who were asking
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.440]   for the bailout in this case are the same people who've talked about the bailout for student debt
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.360]   or whatever, essentially being unfair. When 17 and 18 year olds making big loan decisions,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.000]   you could argue is an ignorance situation, right? People don't understand what they're getting into.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.360]   Okay, someone who didn't understand the FDIC limit, that's their own ignorance maybe.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.520]   I've seen a lot of people making those points. When it does, I know some people argue about
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.120]   what's systemic and what's not. I do think when it gets down to the banking industry like this,
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.640]   there's no regulator politician in their right mind that's going to just, "Okay, let's let the
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.760]   system fail so these people get punished." Because then you punish other people. That's
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.080]   the thinking here. Unless you get a crazy person running one of these FDIC or the Fed or something,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.440]   I don't see how that ever happens where someone just, "Okay, let's let the system fail because
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.400]   these bad actors did something wrong." Ben, you're dead right with that because
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:54.000]   the concern isn't some small businesses over the FDIC limit or some people with a little money over
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.240]   it are going to be punished for going to a local bank. The thinking of the FDIC and the Fed is
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.360]   a run on the bank is pure emotion, pure psychology. It's a contagion and we want to
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.960]   stop it here in its path. If you look at the market the past two weeks, it seems as if the
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.320]   market is behaving. You never want to try and guess what the mostly kind of sort of efficient
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:25.280]   market is thinking, but it seems like the market has said, "Hey, it looks like the Fed and the FDIC
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.560]   has halted the contagion from spreading," and that's good for the overall economy.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.600]   Yeah. All right. Let's do another one, Duncan. Okay. And just a quick follow-up there. What would
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   Monday that week have looked like had they not basically stepped in and said, "We're backstopping
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.200]   above the limit"? A little bit of panic, right? I think if you remember, those of us old enough
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:52.480]   to have traded through '07, '08, '09, it's like every week there was a different piece of news
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.400]   that came out and the market reacted to it. Probably the worst of all was when Congress said,
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.160]   "Oh, we're not going to backstop the Fed. We're not going to allocate any money," and
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.080]   it was like a 10% drop in a couple of days. That was nasty. That was a bad day.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   Late October. That was early October of 2008. That was like, wow.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.600]   I remember that. It was a scary day.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.560]   It might have been the biggest percentage drop since '87.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:20.640]   So it would have had horrible market ramifications, but also bank run potential, right?
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:30.400]   Well, keep in mind, the difference between 2023 and 2006, '07, '08, '09 was every bank,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.880]   every brokerage firm, every private lender, they all had gone to the same buffet,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.440]   and they all were eating the same poisoned food, and they all subsequently got very, very sick.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.280]   This seemed to be, you know, Signature Bank is different than Silicon Valley Bank. There
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.840]   was one other bank that had a separate issue. Some of them had too much exposure to crypto.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.760]   Silicon Valley Bank was a simple duration problem, and by the way, Silicon Valley Bank
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:06.400]   had duration hedges on in 2022, and they had gone up so much in money because of rising rates
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.720]   that they took their profits. They sold them, and everybody got a big fat bonus, not realizing
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.360]   you just took your hedges off, and the Fed is going to continue to raise.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.560]   So, you know, there's always these complex layers of things going on beneath the surface.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:29.040]   Cool. This is a perfect segue to the next question, and by the way, I love this.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.320]   We're helping settle a debate. I love this. I want more of this. People should write in
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.920]   more often for you to settle debates. Okay, so this question's from Kevin.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.760]   "Help me settle a bet I have with one of my co-workers. We're both advisors with an RIA.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.680]   I know there is always something to worry about when it comes to the markets, but what should we
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.600]   worry about more right now? Inflation at 6% or the Fed breaking things/the banking crisis? I'm
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.360]   more worried about the banking crisis leading to a slowdown, while he still thinks inflation
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.680]   should be the Fed's biggest priority. Thoughts?" The funny thing is, Barry, you do a really good
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.520]   job of always looking at the macro through the lens of probabilities, but I think it's hard to
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.000]   kind of separate the two right now, because if there is a banking problem, that could impact
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.120]   inflation, right? So it's kind of hard to handicap this one. Yeah, no doubt about it. I mean,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:21.040]   looking at inflation, especially on the good side, it very much looks like inflation peaked,
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.640]   you know, three quarters ago. In June of last year, look at lumber, container ships, copper,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:33.360]   like all the things that had skyrocketed. Even food prices are moderating. It always feels like
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.720]   the Fed is late. They were late to get off of their emergency footing. They were late to recognize
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:45.280]   inflation. Remember, they had a 2% target, and CPI went through that in March 2021. They waited a
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:52.640]   full year to start tightening. They should have been off of zero long before that. The problem
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:24:01.200]   isn't the level of the Fed at, you know, around 5%. It's how rapidly they raise rates. And that's
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:08.000]   where, you know, I did a blog post a couple of weeks ago, before Silicon Valley blew up. The Fed
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.960]   is breaking things, and it could get worse. And, you know, that fastest ever tightening cycle from
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:23.600]   zero to 5%, that's the problem. 5% is not historically high rates. Right. I think, yes,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.040]   that's the problem is we've never seen it go from zero to five this fast. And it would be nice to
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.720]   have a little bit of a breather here to see what happens and make sure nothing else. Because when
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.560]   people were talking about the Fed breaking stuff, no one ever said it's going to be a banking crisis,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.600]   right? No one was predicting that. People thought, well, the Fed's going to send us into
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.680]   recession, and people are going to lose their jobs. And it was the wrong thing. So I think
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.400]   that's the thing you have to worry about is what are the unintended consequences of this aggressive
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.520]   rate hiking? And if inflation is still high, five or six months down the line, then maybe the Fed
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.560]   has to, you know, step on the gas a little bit more. But I think that's the worry is, like,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.000]   what are the other ramifications here if they keep raising and keep being so aggressive?
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.400]   That's the irony is that it's just a reminder of how bad we are as a species making predictions
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.120]   and forecasting. Everybody a year ago forecasting a recession, turns out the economy is very
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   resilient and employment continues to hold up. But a few years ago, oh, the banks are fine. We could
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.480]   roll back regulations and allow them to carry less capital. That turned out to be a terrible decision.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.280]   Yeah, I think it is, if we're giving the Fed a pass here, managing a $24 trillion economy
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.000]   and trying to get it to maneuver one way or the other is very difficult. And we've seen
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.160]   that their levers that they can pull might not have the desired effects that they want.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   Maybe they shouldn't be trying to manage a $24 trillion economy. And maybe they should listen
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.840]   a little more to the bond market, because it seems like the Fed has spent much of the past three
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.640]   years ignoring what the markets were suggesting to them. And a perfect example from the Lowe's
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:11.760]   post-COVID crash in March 2020, by the end of the year, and this goes directly to your mostly
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:18.160]   efficient market conversation earlier, by the end of the year, the stock market rallied 68%.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:24.560]   If that's not a market signal that, hey, maybe this is an emergency and we should get off zero,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.240]   I, to ignore that, I say with the benefit of perfect 2020 hindsight,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.440]   seems to have been the big mistake. Had they paid attention to that, they could have done
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:42.240]   a quarter point every other meeting and slowly brought us to a place where rates weren't
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.560]   inflationary, but they weren't breaking things. If you throw a dinner party at eight o'clock,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.920]   Jerome Powell's showing up at 1130, right? Always late to the party. Yeah, 100%.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.280]   All right, we got one more. - Okay. So, last but not least,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.520]   we have a question from Brendan. "How did you get your start in writing and podcasting? I'm
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.160]   fascinated by markets and have been since college. I selfishly want to write to document my thoughts
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.640]   and commentary on the market, and if it gains steam, great. Did you find this idea of documentation
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.800]   helpful in your career progression? What initial steps should I take to potentially become a
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.680]   financial journalist on top of working in the industry?" - All right, so I wrote a blog post
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.200]   about this recently, reflecting on some lessons since it's been about 10 years since I started
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.040]   Wealth of Common Sense. I'll go through some of my biggest takeaways and we'll get some of Barry's
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.560]   too. I just said, Barry, you've heard about this before, like writing is a form of learning,
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.320]   like it's, I write to figure out what it is I think. That's part of it that I never really
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.360]   banked on before is how much, how helpful that would be in terms of just collecting your thoughts
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.440]   and it's not just like you have it already formed here, it's like the writing process helps you get
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.080]   it out, right, and helps you figure out what it is you're trying to figure out, right? - A hundred
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.120]   percent. Daniel Boorstin, the former librarian at Congress, used to say, "I write to figure out
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.000]   what I think and besides at that hour all the bars are closed," and, you know, it's only half
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.720]   in jest. Very often until you put words to paper, until you actually type something out, you don't
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:16.480]   really understand the nuance of the whole argument. I started blogging because, and you're coming up
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:22.800]   on 10 years, July will be 20 years for me since the launch of TypePad when I launched. - Did you
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.720]   call the big picture from right away? - So when it was on GeoCities, I know I have some screen grabs
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.400]   of it in like '98 or '99, it might have been the big picture and it was definitely the big picture
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:41.760]   on TypePad which was the first WYSIWYG editor where, you know, on GeoCities you take, you know,
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.200]   a half hour to write something then two hours to code it in HTML. Once you move to TypePad,
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:54.960]   it's sort of like writing on a Word doc or a Google doc where you can underline. Imagine every
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:02.080]   indent, every paragraph break, every, you know, italicized you had to come up with the right code
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:09.200]   for. This made it much easier and then '08 moving to WordPress really turned out to be very robust
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.560]   then and really interesting. - I think the biggest thing, you've been doing this along with me
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.640]   obviously, you and I never got into this because we said we're going to be financial journalists,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.760]   we're going to get a big audience. We did it because we found this stuff interesting and we
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.320]   wanted to put our voices out there. It's not like we had this grand scheme. I think none of us did,
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.680]   me or you or Josh or Michael or Nick. So I think to have longevity and do this for a long time,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.560]   you have to write about things that you care about, not things that you think you want people
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.000]   to read about. You can't like try to optimize this for things people want to learn and I'm
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.800]   going to create the best headlines because that's going to get the most people to read and I'm going
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.880]   to write about this topic because that's what everyone's clamoring for. You obviously want to
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.280]   write stuff people want to read, but you kind of have to do it in your own voice and write about
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.720]   things that you care about. Otherwise, no one else is going to care about them if you don't.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:57.200]   - That's absolutely right. Listen, I started blogging because I wanted to become a better
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.560]   writer and the only way to become a better writer is to A, read good writing and B,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:09.360]   write and preferably a little bit every day. And so what started as, "I'm just going to pull
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:16.720]   a half hour to an hour aside early each morning to prep for the trading day," became just a habit
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   and it's like, you know, the best gym rats are the guys who work into a routine and they just
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.880]   go all the time. It's just part of their daily schedule. It's not like anybody has to tell them
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.200]   go to the gym or go for a run. It's just part of how they operate.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.440]   - It is a routine and obviously there's people who were born to write that just have that natural
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.800]   gene. But when I was in high school and college, I hated writing papers because I never found a
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.840]   topic that I enjoyed enough to actually get into it. And once I started to write about finance and
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.200]   psychology and the markets, I loved it so much that I wanted to do a lot and I go back to the
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.320]   first few things I wrote. They're probably horrible, but I think it's something that if
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   you do it enough and you have a routine, you can get better at too.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:06.320]   - No doubt you get better at it, but really you hit on the magic secret, which is write about
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.520]   things that you're really interested in that you want to learn more about. You know, I do a car
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:18.240]   post a couple of times a month, not because I feel anybody cares what I say about this car or that,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:25.360]   but it kind of allows me to do a deep dive into a particular type of car and just the exercise of
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.600]   researching and pulling out some data and putting it together, like, "Oh, I really understand why
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   this type of EV has become suddenly popular." And it's just, it's a learning exercise.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.520]   - Yeah, and I love the fact that I get to do it now. And sometimes you, personally, I forget people
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.920]   are on the other side reading it sometimes. It's great to get feedback from people.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.960]   - Audience of one.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.720]   - Yeah, that's kind of the way you have to approach it. So I wouldn't approach this
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.400]   trying to become a journalist and build an audience. I would approach it for,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.720]   "Is this going to help me personally, make me a better advisor, make me communicate better to my
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.360]   clients?" And if other people want to read that and you do build an audience, great, but I wouldn't
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.560]   start with that proposition.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.480]   - And to answer the second half of the question about the podcast, you know, some of the writing
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.840]   began because I was frustrated with what I was reading. And I remember having an argument back
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.600]   and forth with a Wall Street Journal editor who were talking, it was, there was a column about the
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.840]   improving housing market from February to March to April. I'm like, "That's seasonality." Guys,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:33.040]   look at it year over year. If it's really improving, it shouldn't be going down year
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:38.960]   over year. It always bottoms in December, January. It always tops in July. Why? Because people want
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.480]   to move into a new school district so their kids don't miss the start of the new school year in
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:51.680]   September. So podcasting kind of began the same way. I was frustrated with the same stupid
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.560]   questions on TV interviews you heard over and over again. So what's your favorite stock? Hey,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.760]   where's the Dow going to be a year from now? And when is the Fed going to raise, cut, whatever?
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:08.720]   And those answers to that question have a shelf life about as long as it takes for the guy to
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:15.200]   walk out of the building, and then they're already stale. So the idea behind Masters in Business was
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.560]   always, "Hey, if I could get really intelligent, accomplished people to sit down with me and say,
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.160]   'Here's how I became who I am. Here's how I developed my process. And here's what you can
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   learn from me.'" I thought that was more valuable than stock picks, forecasts, and Fed predictions.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.920]   Amen. I remember I wrote some piece about like, "Why doesn't financial television do this,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.560]   this, and this?" Back when I just first started blogging. And you emailed me and said, "This is
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.040]   before I even worked with you, I think." And you said, "I'm developing behind the scenes at
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.600]   Bloomberg this sort of thing that you're writing about." And what year was it? 2013, 2014?
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:34:00.480]   So it was the column launched in 2013, and the podcast didn't launch till the following July,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.600]   but it was in development for six months. And by the way, those first six months of
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.840]   podcasts, they're just horrible. They're just not worth listening to.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.600]   That's another thing that you're talking to people and interviewing, that's another thing you can get
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.920]   better at. My favorite recent one is always one of my favorite guests is Cliff Asness,
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.560]   who you said in recent weeks. So good. So much fun. But how often do you get to
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:31.280]   find a legendary fund manager billionaire and ask him if he's a dickhead? I know he's a science
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.680]   fiction wonk, and we were talking about Philip K. Dick, and the fans of Philip K. Dick, of which
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.920]   I count myself as one, call themselves dickheads. So he brought something up. I said, "Are you a
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:50.560]   dickhead?" And he just laughed. He knew exactly where I was going. The ability to have those
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.240]   sorts of conversations. I'm glad you explained that because I did not know that.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:35:00.480]   Okay. The ability to do that is just one of those crazy things, to have that conversation.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.920]   And I wouldn't have asked him that if he, you know he's like a crazy Marvel fan,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:13.440]   and he's a big sci-fi geek, and he actually reeled off all or at least many of the Philip
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:19.280]   K. Dick books that became big science fiction movies. Total Recall, based on Philip K. Dick.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.120]   We Can Remember for Your Wholesale is the name of the book. Blade Runner
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:32.400]   is based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Minority Port. And there was an Amazon series,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.920]   when streaming first got big, called Man in the High Castle, that was based on a Philip K. Dick
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:44.080]   story of what happens if Japan won World War II and America lost? What does the world look like?
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.560]   And you know, he is one of those people that loves that sort of stuff.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:54.960]   That sort of conversation is what makes that format so much fun.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.880]   Yeah. I didn't realize the movie thing was a science fiction. That's great. I love Minority
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:04.320]   Port. One thing I was going to say there, just quickly to Brendan, is he said journalist there.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.640]   I think that there's a distinction here between like blogging and journalism, right? Journalism
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.080]   is kind of the opposite of what you're talking about, where you're told this is what we need
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.160]   you to write about. This is the hot topic this week. You guys can write about whatever you want.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.400]   That's part of the beauty. The people that work for Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal and
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.720]   Financial Times, these people went to journal of the school in those cases, or they were so...
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.320]   Yeah, you're right. That's a totally different thing.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.120]   There's a big difference between opinion and commentary and actually reporting what happened,
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.680]   actually reporting the news. When I had the Washington Post finance column and when I
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:45.200]   write for Bloomberg, it's clear that this is my opinion. And in fact, like when I broke some news
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:54.080]   about the bonuses with Bill Gross and PIMCO, even the way they did it, they brought in Mary Childs
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.800]   to do the story on Bill Gross and I did the opinion piece about why are you paying somebody
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.400]   $300 million annual bonus seems a little excessive for managing fixed income.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.480]   Do you have any news to break today?
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:16.400]   The only news I could break is as soon as you said the mostly sort of efficient market,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:24.800]   that was the title of one of my first viral posts. And I went back and looked at it and
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   embarrassingly, it's 2004, the mostly kind of sort of efficient market. So I don't know if that's
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   news or nostalgia, but it's just hilarious. I was a junior in high school.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.800]   Whatever's old is new again, it just circles around.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.520]   I graduated college that year. Okay. Thanks to Barry for joining us. Love his stories as always.
