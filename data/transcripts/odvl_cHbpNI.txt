[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:14.240]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.740]   We're joined today by Gandalf.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.680]   Still wearing his California hat,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.440]   couldn't get out of the California mood.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.120]   Wanted to thank everyone for coming out to Future Proof.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.520]   We even had a handful of people come up to us
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.800]   and say, "Hey, you answered my question on the show before."
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   - Yeah, that was cool.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.040]   - Everyone was out in full force.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.760]   And we're all kind of just getting home,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   people playing catch-up, so it's just me and Duncan today.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760]   No guests.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.720]   I picked five questions.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.340]   Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com is our email here.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.920]   - To me, I feel like I'm half a person today
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.760]   because half my voice is still gone.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.600]   - Okay.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780]   Duncan lost his voice literally the first day of the event.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.620]   - Yeah.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.440]   - So it didn't last long.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.280]   - We talked to a lot of people, though.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.080]   That's what's always so fun about Future Proof.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.920]   - It was, yeah.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.000]   - Got to meet so many cool people,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.320]   talk with a lot of people. - It was great.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.160]   Yeah. - Great time.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.520]   - People who listen to and watch our shows,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.080]   a ton of people, so yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.920]   Let's do it.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.680]   - Okay, so up first today, we have a question.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   I'm gonna not save a name because it's a little specific.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.560]   But they write in and say, "I recently started looking
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440]   "at my mother-in-law's retirement account.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.000]   "She's been with an advisor since late 2010
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.340]   "and has a 2.61% annual return.
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.520]   "According to their chart, the S&P 500
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.320]   "had a 12.95% annual return during the same period.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.240]   "I know she shouldn't expect a return equal to the S&P
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.520]   "since she has a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.120]   "but it's frustrating how much she's underperformed.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.840]   "She has a new advisor at," and it's the same place,
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.700]   but redacted, "that has her in a few mutual funds
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.900]   "but has 60% of her equity exposure in seven stocks
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.360]   "that he changes two to four times a year.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.900]   "I spoke with him and he's insistent
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.340]   "on keeping seven stocks to 'juice' her returns.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520]   "Should I cut her losses and move her IRA
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.040]   "to an account where she can be in a target date fund
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.280]   "or a Bogle three-fund portfolio?
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.680]   "Is there any reason she should stay
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.940]   "with her current advisor?
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.880]   "Am I crazy for thinking that 60% of your equity exposure
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.160]   "in seven stocks is way too risky for most people?"
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.400]   And maybe you can also hit on
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.840]   what the Bogle three-fund portfolio is.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.420]   I actually don't even know what that is.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.320]   - I got it, I got it, I got you covered.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.940]   I'm usually a fan of ignoring short-term performance
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.400]   with the understanding that long-term returns
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.840]   are the only ones that matter, but in this case,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.360]   I think we've got a long enough sample size.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.440]   Reminded me of an old neighbor I once had.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.560]   This guy was out in his garden all the time.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.320]   My wife and I would always see him
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.520]   working in the backyard, in the garden,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.640]   and we couldn't really figure out
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.880]   what he was doing back there, though.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.480]   I'm hoping he wasn't burying bits and pieces of body
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.680]   because his landscaping always looked like crap.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.000]   He's out there for hours and hours,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   every weekend, every night,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.220]   he's out in his garden doing something.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.440]   But there would always be tons of huge weeds
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.800]   in the mulch and in the rocks.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.360]   There's these spotty grass areas, overflowing flower beds.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.240]   And maybe he just wanted to be outside, that's fine,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.400]   but I always said to my wife,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.240]   it would be nice if he was actually making it look better
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.080]   while he's out there, right?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.640]   It would be nice if he's putting in the hard work
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   and actually seeing some results.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.440]   And it sounds to me like this financial advisor
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.820]   is kind of like this guy's mother-in-law's,
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.280]   the financial advisor is kind of like my old neighbor.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.320]   I guess if we want to take this analogy a step further
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   and make a dad joke, we could say that he's been
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.360]   leaving a lot of weeds in his garden, too,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.200]   based on the stocks.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.080]   I mean, seven stocks is pretty crazy.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   The juicier returns thing,
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.360]   that's like doubling down on a mistake.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.960]   Like you made one mistake and for whatever reason
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.580]   they underperformed and now trying to juice the returns
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.160]   to make up for that shortfall,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   that's just like a recipe for disaster.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.760]   So I think that's just compounding things.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.040]   My rule number one for financial advisors is do no harm,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.000]   especially to people who have already built up
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   enough money and saved.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.560]   This advisor is not following that rule.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.360]   So the Vanguard three fund portfolio
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.460]   is just total stock market US fund,
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.040]   total international stock market index fund,
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.760]   and total bond market index fund, right?
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.520]   So John, do a chart on here.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.600]   I looked at the Vanguard three fund portfolio.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.760]   It's like 35% US stocks, 25% international stocks,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.320]   and 40% bonds for a 60/40 portfolio.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.360]   Since October, 2010, it's more than doubled
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.720]   and we're talking about like a 6.1% annual return.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.000]   So versus a 2.6% for the mother-in-law.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.160]   So John, put the next one on.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.600]   Let's say your mother-in-law had $500,000, right?
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.960]   I put this into the wife charts machine,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.640]   starting off with the $500,000 rebalance on an annual basis.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.800]   And we're talking a little less than $1.1 million
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.820]   if she would have had her money in the Vanguard portfolio.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.000]   Using that 2.6% annual return you gave me
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.240]   would be more like $740,000.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.540]   So that's a huge shortfall, right?
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.200]   I'm guessing a target date fund would be pretty similar
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.240]   to the Vanguard three fund portfolio,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.280]   maybe a little more diversification, plus or minus,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.840]   but pretty close.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.960]   I'm not saying that Vanguard is always the answer
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.860]   and just put it in a simple portfolio.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.360]   But I would also ask the mother-in-law,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.240]   what else are you getting out of this relationship, right?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.820]   If the advisor is only helping her
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.200]   with investment management and picking stocks,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.160]   they're basically a stockbroker
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   when there are a ton of other ways they could add value.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.280]   So I think there's a lot that goes into an advisor
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.960]   besides just portfolio management,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.700]   financial planning and tax planning, insurance planning,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.240]   state planning, withdrawal strategies, budgeting,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.760]   helping people make better decisions, all this stuff.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.920]   - That's something that's wild to me
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.340]   about the finance industry is that it seems like
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.040]   almost anyone can just call themselves an advisor.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.880]   - Yes. - Different people
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.000]   have different understandings of what that even means.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.800]   - And unfortunately for some people
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.320]   who just don't know any better,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.720]   I'm guessing the advisor has been making up excuses
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.040]   along the way or painting a different narrative,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.880]   whatever they're doing.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.640]   But I also think that you have to approach
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.720]   this conversation very delicately
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.080]   because this was an expensive mistake.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.440]   It was during a raging bull market
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.540]   and the returns have been awful.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.560]   People don't like talking about their financial mistakes.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560]   And I think it's one of the reasons
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.680]   why there's so much inertia with decisions like this
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.320]   and people just kind of keep the status quo
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.680]   because they don't want to think,
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.280]   "Well, if I already made mistakes,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.360]   "what if I change and it's even worse?"
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.640]   So there's a good chance that the mother-in-law
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.480]   didn't know how bad things were.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.600]   So don't make her feel bad here, right?
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.920]   Help her learn from the mistake,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.080]   work with her to help find someone
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.100]   who can right the ship, diversify the portfolio more.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.840]   Seven stocks is ridiculous.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.620]   Warren Buffett holds way more than that
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.040]   and he has way more diversity in his portfolio.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.240]   You want to find someone who's going to manage risk
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.560]   a little more prudently.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.080]   I would just suggest you help her find someone
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   who can create a comprehensive plan,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.440]   set realistic expectations,
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.000]   and then maybe be more transparent
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.960]   with how they're managing the money.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.200]   So the idea is that you can outsource
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.720]   your money management to someone else if you want,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.320]   but you have to understand what's going on in the portfolio
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.560]   and why, and I'm guessing this place
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.440]   didn't do a very good job
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.760]   of setting those expectations up front.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.800]   I would get her out of there as quickly as possible.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.320]   Don't stop it, go.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.800]   - Yeah, I mean, and if he's really looking
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.560]   to juice the portfolio, then that advisor
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.360]   should be trading options and stuff in there, right?
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.560]   - Zero day?
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   Yeah, I mean, that's just, I mean,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.640]   talk about a huge rip. - I just love that term.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.400]   He used it as a quote, so I'm guessing
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.080]   the advisor literally said, "Juice the returns."
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.240]   - And obviously, these advisors don't want to see
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   the money go out the door,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.800]   so they're going to do everything in their power
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   to talk you into it.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.720]   I would get her out of it immediately
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.860]   and find someone else who can help.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.280]   - Yeah.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.440]   I mean, this one came in.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.080]   You feel horrible for these situations, right?
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.480]   Because my whole thing is always,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.200]   you get one investing life cycle
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.480]   and time horizon and timeline.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.080]   You don't get to choose when it starts, when it ends.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.200]   If you miss out on a 10, 12-year period of returns,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.360]   that is really difficult to make up.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.960]   - And playing devil's advocate
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.760]   or being like giving the benefit of the doubt,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.960]   what would you say to this advisor
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.680]   if they're like watching this show?
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   - Find a new line of work?
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.840]   (laughs)
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.160]   I mean, that's just, it's a horrible way to manage risk.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.400]   It sounds like, I mean, it's gambling.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.540]   It's speculating.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.440]   I had a friend who, we would play blackjack,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.120]   and every time he'd lose, he'd go,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.480]   "I'm just going to double my bet.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.360]   "That way I can't lose," right?
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.920]   Which works until it doesn't, obviously.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.240]   The whole doubling down
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.040]   and trying to make up for past mistakes,
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.060]   the market's not going to give you those returns back
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.560]   just because you want them.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.540]   - Yeah, makes sense.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.360]   - Let's do another one.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.760]   - Cool, thanks for the question.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.440]   Okay, up next we have a question from Mitch.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.040]   Love the show, finally have something worth asking about.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   I'm 26, live in Southwest Michigan, single, no kids,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.680]   income $180,000 to $250,000 a year, depending on bonus,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.120]   currently renting as I plan to move closer to home
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.560]   in no less than two years from now.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.280]   I have always been a good saver
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.460]   and made some decent stock picks a few years ago.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.760]   My $450,000 brokerage account is now 100% invested
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.600]   in the S&P 500 with a slightly lower cost basis
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.920]   than today's price.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.800]   However, I'm contemplating purchasing a vacation home
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.840]   up North for around $350,000 and paying cash for it,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.040]   leaving about $100,000 in retirement,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.680]   but still saving 70 plus percent of my take home.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.360]   Have I gone completely crazy or is this feasible?
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.040]   And as a Michigander, when he says up North,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.840]   like does he mean up in Northern Michigan
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.520]   or does he mean like Canada?
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.480]   - I'm guessing Northern,
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.560]   that we say up North for Northern Michigan here.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.660]   So yeah, this is our first not to brag of the week,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.140]   both in terms of the affordability of housing
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.560]   in Northern Michigan, I guess, and the savings rate.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.120]   And so good on you, Duncan, you've heard the story
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.520]   about the fishermen and the businessmen in Florida before.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.480]   Is this, have you heard this one?
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.320]   - Doesn't ring a bell.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.260]   - All right, this is kind of an old one,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.840]   but there's a fisherman lying on the beach somewhere
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.640]   and a businessman walks up to him and he says,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.440]   "You're not gonna catch many fish that way."
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.280]   He said, "You should be working.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.200]   "What are you lying on the beach for?"
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   And the fisherman said, "Well, what good is that gonna do me?
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.260]   "I have a fishing charter already.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.040]   "I take some people out, but I don't work that much."
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.720]   He said, "Well, if you start this business
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.460]   "and catch a lot of fish, you can get bigger nets
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.180]   "and catch more fish, then you can get a fleet of boats
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.080]   "and catch even more fish."
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.320]   And the guy said, "Well, what's the point of that?"
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.680]   And he said, "Well, once you buy a bigger boat
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.000]   "and you have a bigger fleet,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.740]   "you can start a whole business around it.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.100]   "You can make tons of money."
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.040]   And he said, "Well, what's the point of that?"
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.140]   He said, "Well, you'll make so much money someday
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.900]   "that you'll be able to lie on the beach
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.040]   "and do anything you want."
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.620]   And the guy said, "Well, I'm doing that already.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.760]   "What's the point?"
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.600]   Right?
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.820]   And so I think if you can get to the point
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.660]   where you've saved enough and you can enjoy
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.140]   the early fruits of your labor
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.420]   and a semi-retirement while you're young and still working,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.020]   and you've already saved enough, why not do this, right?
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.700]   I don't think many people have ever regretted
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.580]   buying a vacation home, if they can afford it, right?
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.700]   There obviously are other costs and stuff
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.140]   that come with it, but if this single person,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.620]   no responsibilities, no mortgage yet,
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.100]   and you can do this in cash
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.260]   and forego the whole 7% mortgage thing,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.220]   that sounds wonderful to me.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.660]   I'd be curious to know where he's buying,
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.060]   but especially if you can easily backfill those savings
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.580]   as a young person, it sounds to me
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.060]   like they're in a pretty good place.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.160]   I mean, the most important question
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.900]   most people want answered when they're dealing
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.620]   with a financial advisor, from my perspective,
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.800]   is am I gonna be okay, right?
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.500]   If I spend this money on this house or on this car,
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.340]   am I gonna be okay?
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.540]   If this is my asset allocation, am I going to be okay?
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.340]   If I take this new job or retire early
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.780]   or take Social Security here, am I gonna be okay?
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.340]   That's kind of what people want to know.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.380]   That's what it sounds like he's asking here.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.660]   And based on past history of savings
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.700]   and savings rate and income and all these things,
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.500]   it sounds to me like you're gonna be okay.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.540]   And I don't think this is the kind of thing
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.660]   where you're gonna look back in 20 years
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.900]   after all the memories you've created in this vacation home
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.400]   in one of the most beautiful parts of the world,
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.340]   especially in the summer, maybe in the winter too,
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.700]   you can become a skier, you're probably gonna be okay.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.780]   I mean, so I say, if you have the ability
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.660]   to enjoy some of your money now,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.340]   rather than waiting to buy that vacation home
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.820]   when you're 65, I'd say go for it.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.640]   - Yeah, I saw quite a bit of Michigan
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.620]   represented at Future Proof.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.660]   - Not bad, a lot of Midwestern.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.660]   - Several other, yeah, several other people.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.900]   - Yeah, so yeah, good on you.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.740]   If you can do this, enjoy it.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.260]   - Yeah, sounds good to me.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.380]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.980]   - All right, up next, we have a question from Greg.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.620]   Is the period of time when you have kids
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.820]   one of the most financially challenging times in your life?
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.380]   We have a two and four-year-old.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.960]   It has seemed as though these early years in their lives
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.740]   have been the most financially challenging
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.500]   as there are constant expenses.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.700]   They need care every waking hour by somebody.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.220]   They drain me and my wife's energy,
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.560]   which makes work harder, not to mention excelling
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.860]   to get any kind of promotion.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.160]   And of course, we're always going to the doctor with them,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.780]   paying babysitters, childcare, activities,
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.380]   buying more food, et cetera.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.820]   Don't get me wrong here, I absolutely love my kids,
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.420]   but curious to hear your take.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.080]   Also, is it okay to not save or make as much
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.620]   during these couple of years in order to pay
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.460]   for more childcare to keep yourself sane?
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.220]   I heard around 10 years old,
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.300]   they don't want anything to do with me,
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.380]   or they won't want anything to do with me,
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.800]   so maybe I can really get back to it then.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.300]   - I'm guessing young people just out of college
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.900]   might quibble with this one.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.060]   It's certainly up there in terms of like
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.460]   the most challenging financial years.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.020]   Young people who have student loans
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.860]   and paying high rent and all these things,
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.300]   but kids are very expensive.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.260]   I've equated paying to put three kids through daycare
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.300]   as putting them through college
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   without having 18 years to plan for it.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.220]   It's very expensive, so the only silver lining
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.900]   I can think of for my having kids
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.340]   is just not having as much time or money
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.740]   to spend on yourself.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.060]   But yeah, the childcare thing is very expensive.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.460]   Either you have to pay a lot for it,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.980]   or someone has to step back in terms of
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.680]   one of the spouses has to step back
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.620]   and maybe not work as much,
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.420]   or both of you just don't have as much time or energy
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.780]   to, as you said, put your foot forward in terms of your job.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.940]   I actually did talk to someone this week
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.220]   about Future Proof, about kids,
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.780]   and people were asking me,
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.220]   one of the things was,
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.100]   is it weird that people know all about you and your kids
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.380]   because you're on a podcast and stuff all the time?
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.480]   I said, whatever.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.220]   But my kids are, twins are six,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.260]   and my oldest daughter is nine,
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.100]   and I was talking to a guy,
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.020]   and he said, "My kids are 17 and 14 now."
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.100]   And he said, "It is kind of weird
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.700]   "because they get to the teenage years,"
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.260]   and everyone says this, right?
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.980]   Your kids don't want anything to do with you anymore.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.960]   They just want to hang with their friends,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.800]   or they want to be in the room,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.080]   or you just don't see them as much.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.560]   You don't have to be, you know,
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.960]   helicoptering around them as much.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.640]   And he said, "It's opened up a whole new life for me again.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.620]   "I can go hiking in the morning.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.680]   "I can go out to get drinks with my friends more.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.920]   "I can go out to dinner."
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.200]   Because the kids are always doing
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.120]   their own sort of social thing.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.160]   So he did say it kind of opens up.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.580]   And the thing is, people are saying,
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.920]   is just savor this time with your kids
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.840]   'cause at a certain point, it's gonna go away,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.360]   which I do take to heart.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.040]   So I think you can look at your finances in the same way.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.920]   You just might have to supercharge your savings rate
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.240]   after the kids are off your payroll.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.780]   Now, that might take some more time.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.480]   I don't know if all of a sudden at age 10
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.840]   or in their teenagers, they're gonna need less money.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.960]   In some ways, it could be just more money, actually.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.560]   But I have heard a lot of people say,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.080]   like, listen, that's why it's so beneficial
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.920]   to have that catch-up savings for your IRA and 401(k)
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.160]   that the government allows you in your 50s
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.360]   is because maybe that's the time that you have to do it,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.440]   is when the kids are out of the house
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.400]   and they're off their payroll,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.660]   and they're through college,
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.400]   or whatever they're doing with their life,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.340]   and they're out of the house,
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.400]   then that's when you can supercharge your life a little bit.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   The other thing is just,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.280]   I think time management is more important
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.120]   than ever when you have kids
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   because you don't wanna miss anything,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.120]   but you also wanna keep this part of your life going.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.080]   So some stuff has to fall by the wayside, right?
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.320]   I think Ryan Holiday, if you've ever read any of his books,
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   he says there's three things that you can have.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.840]   You can have family, you can have work,
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.680]   and you can have the scene.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.320]   And the scene is what he calls going out and partying.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.400]   He's like, pick two because you can't have all three.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.100]   So you're gonna have to just learn
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.740]   to prioritize a little bit better,
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.420]   and maybe some of the stuff you used to do in your life
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.600]   you're not gonna be able to do anymore
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.860]   if you want to have the work and family life
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.220]   work out for you.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.700]   - So I don't have kids,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.020]   but it seems to me like you could save a little money
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.540]   by picking which sport you funnel them into.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.860]   Soccer has to be a lot cheaper
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.740]   than lacrosse or football, right?
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.220]   It would seem like it at least.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.780]   - Yeah, or hockey because of all the...
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.700]   The great thing about soccer,
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.020]   which I was never a soccer player growing up,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.280]   I always did other stuff is--
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.760]   - I was big into soccer.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.000]   - You know that the game's gonna start here
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.840]   and it's gonna end here.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.680]   There's no timeouts.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.520]   It's just there's a halftime and it's just free.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.280]   That's one of the things I love about it.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   Unfortunately, my son is getting into baseball,
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.240]   which means like double headers in three-hour games.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.840]   And so I'm trying to steer him clear of that,
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   but it's not working.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.800]   But yeah, I think it's okay to...
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.640]   I think you just have to make sure
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.680]   you're planning ahead for other points of your life
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.440]   when you're gonna be able to backfill a little bit
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.120]   and supercharge it when you can prioritize that.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.720]   And if sometimes a family comes first, then so be it.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   You're gonna have to just give up
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.120]   on other parts of your life.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.220]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.600]   - But I totally get it.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.840]   This is the stuff lots of parents talk about.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.960]   You know, I'm tired all the time of running around.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.800]   I'm dealing with...
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.960]   It's certainly a lot.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.800]   I think you just have to understand that,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.520]   yeah, sure, there's gonna be times
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.560]   where you wish you could save more,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.400]   but I mean, the kids kind of come first for a lot of people.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.640]   - Yeah, makes sense.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.280]   At some point, you can put 'em to work for you,
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.840]   you know, once they're old enough.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.760]   Get the Roth or tax advantage account
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.800]   you can get if your kid works for you.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.880]   - I just thought you meant put 'em to work on YouTube
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.960]   and have them work for you. - That was weird too.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   - All right.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.620]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Bill.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.880]   I'm 28 and have recently become very interested
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.600]   in sports gambling and trying to beat the books.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.400]   This is a great question, I like this.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.680]   This year, I've made about $5,000 from gambling,
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.520]   which is about double my starting bankroll.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.920]   Much of that is attributable to new player promos
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   that I cannot do again, and some luck.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.760]   Long shot tennis futures, whatever that means.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.400]   However, I do think that if I put in the time,
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.920]   I could be profitable and outperform
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.520]   traditional equity investments.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.440]   Am I an idiot if I move money out of my
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.300]   traditional investments into sports books?
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.520]   I view it as a business rather than gambling,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.900]   but that may just be the degenerate gambler in me talking.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.680]   - All right, many of the questions that we get
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.280]   exist in a state of gray.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.980]   Like, there's few black or white answers,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.520]   and it's like, you could do this and you'd be okay,
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.980]   or you could do this and you'd be okay.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.140]   Not this question.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.840]   Do not do this, do not even think about doing this.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.160]   No, sports gambling is a form of entertainment.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.780]   It is not a business, and yes, you are a degenerate gambler
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.320]   if you're thinking about doing this.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.160]   And he even admitted that he hit on some
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.720]   long shot tennis futures, and he had some sign up promos,
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.000]   and the people who actually do this for a living,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.640]   like, they understand how Vegas sets the lines, right?
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.440]   They understand that, like, the tendencies of teams
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.240]   to perform based on certain circumstances,
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.840]   like, after a back-to-back game on the road,
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.080]   this team typically will underperform the spread
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.240]   by one and a half points or whatever.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.480]   It's, the people who do, and there's quantitative models,
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.540]   if you, I mean, the, trust me, Vegas,
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.440]   the house will always win in this scenario,
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.560]   and the assumption that, well, I'm gonna hit a parlay
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   once every three months, and that's gonna bankroll me
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.520]   for the rest of the year, no.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.840]   If you wanna put some money into this
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.560]   and have this be your entertainment budget,
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.360]   I am fine with that, but you wanna take your money
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   out of your retirement accounts,
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.480]   your investment accounts for this, I say no.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.440]   This is way better business for FanDuel or DraftKings.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.940]   You know, when you hear a podcast advertised
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.360]   for FanDuel or DraftKings, that the fine print
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.280]   that they have to read afterwards
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.640]   is always 10 times longer than the actual ad itself,
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.000]   and they read it, like, a million miles an hour?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.840]   - Yeah.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.680]   - There's a reason for that.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   This, it's, no one comes and cleans the house with that.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.760]   The people who do this for a living have way more money
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.360]   and way more knowledge, and they have systems in place,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.760]   and they're not hitting long shots
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.880]   and player promos and getting lucky.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.440]   No, do not do this with your investment account
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.600]   under no circumstances. - And for the record,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.520]   you're not, like, against sports gambling or anything.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.360]   You like-- - Oh, it's fun.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.080]   - You like doing this for fun and stuff, but--
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.400]   - Yeah, and I love going into a casino.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.280]   I haven't been in a while, but I'll go play blackjack,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.560]   but the money that I take out to play blackjack,
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   I assume it's going to be gone by the end of the night.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.480]   If I win money, that's a benefit, it's a bonus,
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.240]   but if I lose any money, I look at that as, like,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.840]   paying money to go to a concert.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.440]   It's like, that money is a form of consumption.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.560]   That is entertainment that is not investing,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.040]   because there's no way that you understand
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.520]   how this stuff works as well as the professionals do,
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.280]   and even them, it's very difficult.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.560]   - Yeah, and I've kind of done the opposite of this,
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   honestly.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.680]   I've lost, like, every penny that I've ever done
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.040]   on FanDuel, that kind of thing,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.640]   so I was just like, I'm just gonna put it in the market
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.960]   and just, like, buy penny stocks and have fun that way.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.480]   To me, that's more fun than gambling on sports, personally.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.560]   - That way, you don't have the double whammy
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.040]   of your team losing and your bets losing, right?
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   - Right, exactly, yeah.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.820]   - Although, I've done the emotional hedge.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.080]   I, like, I bet against my team sometimes,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.200]   but that feels gross, too, you know?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.880]   Like, I know if my team loses, at least I'm gonna--
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.080]   I can't do that either, so that feels kind of gross as well,
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.840]   but I'd kind of shy away from this one
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.160]   and lean towards, yes, you're a degenerate gambler.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.880]   Keep, put some money in there,
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.920]   but under the assumption that you're not going to win
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.820]   in the long run.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.960]   - Yeah, have fun, but don't mess up your retirement,
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.800]   probably.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.620]   - No.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.460]   - Yeah.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.300]   Okay.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.120]   - And guess what?
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.960]   The worst thing that can happen
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.320]   is you hit another long shot and you go,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.640]   oh, I'm good at this.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.120]   I can do this, right?
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   The people who hit the parlays are so lucky.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.640]   Sorry, you're not good at it, you're lucky.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.120]   - That's why I lost all my money on Marist,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.800]   because I just love doing the insane parlays.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.640]   - Yes.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.360]   Bet on the Super Bowl or something, occasionally,
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.540]   but don't make it your retirement plan.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.760]   - Good advice.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.600]   Okay, so last but not least, we have a question from Mike.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.960]   I'm 62 and planning to retire at 65.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.480]   My current retirement portfolio is about 55%,
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.320]   or $370,000 in equities, primarily S&P 500 index funds,
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.080]   and the remaining 45% is in long-term CDs
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.640]   with a remaining seven-year term at 4.25%.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.880]   I've never owned any bonds and consider the CDs
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.840]   the safe part of my portfolio.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.680]   This worked out well during the last downturn
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.560]   when both stocks and bonds took a hit.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.240]   What are your thoughts about my allocation?
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.400]   - Seven-year CDs at 425 is pretty darn good, actually.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.960]   My whole take for the last five years or so
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.560]   has been that you have to be way more thoughtful
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.480]   about fixed income asset allocations than you did
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.320]   in the past.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.400]   In the '80s and '90s and 2000s, it was pretty easy
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.840]   'cause rates were so high.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.320]   Pretty much anything you put your money into was fine.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.840]   There are pros and cons to using CDs.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.720]   I'm sure this was a great strategy
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.400]   for a rising rate environment
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.480]   'cause those CD rates are locked in.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.720]   So the pros is you don't have to worry
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.040]   about that interest rate risk.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.240]   If you have current CDs and rates rise, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.160]   You don't lose principal or price.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.520]   You're just missing out on opportunity costs
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.920]   of those higher rates.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.000]   But if you had these, whatever,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.240]   foreign change rates locked in, that's pretty darn good.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.080]   The con is you have to worry about reinvestment risk.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.720]   So I don't know if this is a laddered portfolio,
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.920]   but this money is all in one CD.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.800]   So that's, laddering it can actually help a little bit.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.600]   So you have one, two, three, four, five year CDs
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.800]   or something, and as they come up,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.120]   that lowers your reinvestment risk a little bit.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.480]   But it's true for most fixed income investments
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   that you have some reinvestment risk,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.320]   but it's certainly true here,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   especially if you lock in higher rates
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.700]   and they're lower when you go to re-up.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.960]   Another pro is that you know exactly what you're getting.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.040]   The yield and maturity length are set in advance
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.840]   so you know that specific amount of money that you put in.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.760]   You're getting the principal back
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.440]   plus whatever income at maturity.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.920]   So from a planning perspective,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.980]   CDs are pretty good, right?
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.080]   Bonds, there's some uncertainty involved,
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.640]   but CDs, that's pretty good.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.580]   The con is that they're liquid, right?
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.240]   So if you're thinking from a planning perspective,
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.400]   you wanna keep this 60/40 or 65/35 or whatever it is,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.840]   rebalancing them is kind of difficult.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.440]   You can get out of a CD early,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.480]   but typically it comes with an early termination penalty,
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.440]   kind of like those savings I bonds we talked about
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.200]   where they'll just take some of the income
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.760]   so you won't get the same rate if you wanted to rebalance
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.600]   or you had a liquidity event
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   and you didn't wanna sell stocks,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.440]   but you wanted to sell CDs.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.840]   So there are pros and cons here,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.120]   but I think if you know that stuff going in
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.460]   and you wanna use CDs,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.600]   I looked today, there's still six and 12 month
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.120]   and 18 month CDs that are close to 5%.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.200]   I think going out a little further,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.240]   you're not gonna find those high rates anymore.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.160]   But as long as you understand what you're going into,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.960]   know what you're getting into,
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.640]   I don't think it's a terrible idea.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.480]   I think the idea of maybe spreading your bets a little bit
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.160]   between CDs and T-bills
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.720]   and then some sort of intermediate term bonds or whatever
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.040]   is not a bad idea
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.080]   to give yourself some more diversification there.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.800]   But if you know the pros and cons going in,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.640]   CDs aren't a bad deal.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.840]   - Are there funds that do this laddering for you
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.720]   or do you have to manually do this?
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.960]   - No, there's some bond fund ladder.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.800]   I guess a CD ladder would be kind of nice
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.480]   if a bank would just do it for you,
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.760]   but yeah, so that's the other part
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.000]   is that it's probably more of a manual process to do it.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.880]   And it's easier now than when I bought my first CD
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.000]   and I had to go down to the bank to do it
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.840]   and write them a check.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   You can just do it online now at some of these places.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.000]   But yeah, I mean, it's not a horrible strategy.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.800]   Again, I'm sure he felt great having this strategy
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.760]   when interest rates were rising
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.200]   and bonds were getting killed.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.360]   - Yeah.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.440]   - But yeah, it's not the worst strategy.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.280]   It was for sure.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.520]   - Cool.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.360]   - We'll take it.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.200]   - Makes sense.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.480]   - We got some good questions today.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.320]   - Yeah, really good ones.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.240]   - Rachel said she liked the range.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.520]   I liked the range today too.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.920]   It was good.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.320]   - We have diversification of audience, don't we?
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.160]   - We do.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.000]   We definitely do.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.820]   - I like it.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.320]   Some investing, some personal finance, some housing.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   - And if you're here because you clicked on the thumbnail
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.680]   because of this stupid hat,
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.880]   just know I'll never wear this again,
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.120]   but thanks for watching.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.800]   - Did you buy that hat in California?
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.880]   - Yeah, at the hotel the first day we arrived.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.700]   I saw it and was like,
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.440]   "I'm not getting sunburned this year."
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.240]   And I put it on, wore it the whole time.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   - Good idea.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.900]   I didn't get a sunburn either.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.040]   I had a nice tan going in.

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.980]   Or something?
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.820]   - It's true.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.660]   - Yeah.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.480]   - Compound sticker.

[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.500]   - That's it.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.340]   See you, everyone.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.160]   - Thanks, everyone.
