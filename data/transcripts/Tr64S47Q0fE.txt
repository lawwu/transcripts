[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   Starting a company is the best way to build wealth.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.000]   Is that true?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   Did you always think that if it is?
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.600]   It always seems so risky to have these day jobs.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   And then I thought, oh man, entrepreneurship,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.540]   I don't know how much I have to make.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.380]   And then I recognized like, well,
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.160]   how much do I need to really be able to do the thing
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.440]   I want to do and have freedom?
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.360]   Because we don't have as much time available.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.720]   How do we find what's just the essence of getting started?
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960]   With AppSumo, I put in $50 to start it.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.840]   And last year I made $3.3 million.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.300]   Most people want to be time millionaires.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.440]   I would say that's universal.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.680]   Don't trade your nine to five for a five to nine.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.000]   The whole point of being an entrepreneur
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.720]   is that you can then become a time millionaire as well.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.880]   So how do you practice starting right now?
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.520]   You started things, you feel good about yourself,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.840]   you got momentum, you got the skills.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.960]   Now, how do you build it?
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.280]   What's the high level process someone needs to go through?
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.360]   It's in the book.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.320]   It's a good investment.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.240]   But no, I'll give it to you for free.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.200]   I'll give it to you for free.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.640]   Noah, thanks for being here.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.040]   Chris, thank you for having me.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.840]   So from the title of the book,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.640]   it seems you might think that starting a company
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.360]   is the best way to build wealth.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.380]   Is that true?
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.120]   Did you always think that if it is?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.800]   (laughs)
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.880]   Coming in hot.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.280]   I love it.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.840]   Let's just look at data.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   So if you put your money,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.680]   do you put your money in the stock market at all?
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680]   I do.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.560]   Yeah, like a great return on the S&P 500 is like 10%.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.640]   Wow.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000]   Yeah, if I got locked in 10%, boy would I be happy.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.960]   If you could do that, right?
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.360]   But if you look at the data since 1900,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.840]   that's what you get at around 10 to 12% a year.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   Then if you look at housing, maybe it appreciates,
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.360]   but generally house, give or take,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   will do five to 7% return.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   Now, this is a, I'll just give you an example.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600]   With AppSumo, I put in $50 to start it,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.400]   and last year I made $3.3 million.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.840]   And I'm not saying that everyone can do that within a year,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.920]   but over some time, the returns and upside
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560]   of entrepreneurship are unlimited,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.520]   while a lot of the costs are much smaller.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.440]   And so, just kind of maybe something I've thought about
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   for a lot of people, it's like you can work your butt
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.560]   trying to get clean an attic,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.440]   and then literally my house yesterday flooded,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.160]   a real estate house I have,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.360]   or you can just start your own business.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.800]   There's different problems, but at least the upside
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   and the influence of it are much higher.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.480]   - And did you always think of it this way?
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.120]   I think you and I both share a similar background.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.080]   Early careers all in startup land in Silicon Valley
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   seemed like building tech companies
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.960]   is the way you make money,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.280]   and then we probably had other friends that made money,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   and then we're like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.160]   maybe the way money is real estate.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.520]   Maybe real estate is how we make money.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.860]   I keep hearing that this is the best thing ever.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.680]   I have both FOMO about not buying more real estate
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.620]   and deep satisfaction only owning my house.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.560]   - My next book is called "Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and Stepdad."
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.040]   And it's like, there's another dad
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.960]   that no one ever talked about that was just like,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.560]   I don't know why these guys are working so hard.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.840]   You know, I think what's interesting,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.720]   we talked before about my YouTube channel.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.040]   One of the coolest things is that
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800]   there's so many different ways of getting rich.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.000]   And when you grew up, I grew up a few miles from Apple.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.020]   My father sold copiers and my stepfather
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.700]   was a computer programmer.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.780]   And I thought that's just the way to have money,
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.300]   but I realized, wow, there's so many other ways,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.580]   like fruit selling, basements, this guy Larry Janeski,
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.420]   Michael Hudder did ships, Paul Mitchell did hair care.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.420]   Hair care.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.820]   And yes, there is a lot of money in the internet too,
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.780]   which just came out 24 years ago, if you think about it.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.780]   And that always gets me so excited
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.860]   is that there's so many different ways
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.460]   for people to find what they're interested in.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.360]   And look, if you have a day job, I think that's even better
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.860]   'cause now you have an investor, which is your employer,
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.740]   to now explore all these other options
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.800]   that can create unlimited wealth for you.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.440]   - And do you think this is a path for everyone
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.660]   or how do you think about building companies
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.740]   and starting side hustles for someone
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.860]   who maybe never thought that was for them?
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.660]   - Most people wanna be time millionaires.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.860]   I would say that's universal.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.140]   And most people would like to be a millionaire or beyond.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.340]   And they actually realize that you probably need less money
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.420]   to live a very satisfied life.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.540]   That's why in the book I've talked about
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.580]   the freedom number, 'cause you realize
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.820]   that number's actually a lot less than you think.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.740]   What I've recognized though is that most people
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.180]   think it's this big, scary thing.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.260]   Like take my brother, for instance.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.100]   He's a doctor.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.180]   He went to school for 10 years.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.780]   He got a certificate to do his stuff.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.260]   And what's crazy about entrepreneurship,
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.500]   you don't need a certificate.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.620]   (laughs)
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.740]   Everyone has permission.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.900]   And you don't even have to be tall.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.340]   You know, I'm only 5'10".
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.540]   You can be really short or you can be super tall
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.380]   or you can be anything.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.140]   And I think that's just so amazing
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.940]   how accessible it can be.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.740]   And the reality though is that
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.660]   we create this big, scary monster of,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.020]   well, I've gotta be a talkative person
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.660]   or I've gotta go be on Twitter
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.500]   or I've gotta go sell.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.460]   And that's just not the case.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.580]   But you do have to think, wow, I could maybe do this.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.100]   Let me see how I could maybe change my life in a weekend.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.060]   Which I would say is possible for everyone out there.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.340]   And especially if you have a day job.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.140]   I don't know if you've ever been fired, Chris.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.020]   - I have. - You've been fired?
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.100]   - And I've been fired twice.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.420]   And thank you, Mark.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.860]   And thank you, Matt Kohler.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.300]   Thank you, Aaron Patzer.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.500]   And the beauty of getting fired is the moment I realized
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.060]   that I'm not in control of my livelihood.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.860]   These two people at two companies,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.340]   Facebook and Mint, which I was early at,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.140]   decided that I'm not good to be there anymore.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.620]   And that was, so it really sparked with me,
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.540]   then got early on, like, wow, if that could happen,
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.060]   I need to protect myself.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.460]   And so you can create a business.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.940]   It could be a flower shop.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.260]   And then keep your day job as well.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.820]   So at AppSumo, where I work, we have this lady, Amy,
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.900]   she has a flower shop and a hair salon.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.780]   And she's also our head of customer support.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.860]   (laughs)
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.980]   You have Nick Christensen,
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.220]   who has a teeth whitening clinic up in Dallas.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.020]   And he leads our growth team.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.740]   And so it doesn't mean you have to quit your day job.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.900]   Ideally, maybe have both.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.260]   But at least have that option available to you.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.220]   - Yeah, I think, and maybe it's Silicon Valley,
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.260]   but it felt to me for so long,
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.220]   maybe until this podcast, that starting a company was like,
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.180]   I'm gonna start a thing that's all-consuming,
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.700]   that's gonna be everything to me,
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.420]   and I'm gonna work a million hours a day
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.300]   and have thousands of employees, or it's a failure.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.580]   (laughs)
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.340]   - No, I love the line, don't trade your nine-to-five
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.740]   for a five-to-nine, right?
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.860]   The whole point of being an entrepreneur
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.860]   is that you can then become a time millionaire as well,
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.100]   where you can spend, like, I'm going to Spain in two weeks
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.820]   to have a family.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.620]   And that's a lot, if I had a boss who was like,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.420]   no, you can't travel, you gotta come to the office,
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.260]   you gotta, I don't know,
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.460]   but entrepreneurship gives me that affordability.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.580]   And with business, the greatest part about it,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.140]   which people don't recognize, is that, yes,
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.420]   it does take some effort to get started.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.780]   Yes, you have to find something people are excited
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.020]   to give you money for,
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.620]   but you can ultimately spend most of your time,
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.140]   if not all of it, in just the areas you like.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.420]   And guess what, there's people
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.940]   that like doing customer support, like Amy,
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.940]   which I don't know how she does it.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.540]   Shout out, Amy, I love you.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.340]   And there's people who like doing operational stuff,
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.300]   Dusty, Vanessa, thank you guys for doing that.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.460]   And they're happy there,
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.820]   and they get to live their dream lives,
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.460]   and that is available.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.900]   It's not such this, like, oh, I've got to spend all night
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.860]   and don't have any free time around it.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.020]   That's what this stuff enables you
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.500]   to have that option available.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.180]   - And you said the freedom number people need
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.020]   is a lot smaller than you think.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.180]   - For me, it always seemed risky,
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.460]   this freedom number, the way I realized it,
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.100]   and I've noticed that a lot of other entrepreneurs have had,
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.820]   it always seems so risky to have these day jobs,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.020]   like I did at Intel.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.580]   And then I thought, oh man, entrepreneurship,
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.540]   I don't know how much I have to make.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.020]   And then I recognized, well, how much do I need
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.660]   to really be able to do the thing I want to do
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.500]   and have freedom?
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.780]   And it was way less than I expected, right?
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.460]   And it really came down to kind of three categories,
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.020]   which is like living, entertainment, and savings,
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.500]   or living, food, savings.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.180]   And for me, it was $3,000.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.460]   And when I was at my day job, I was like,
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.100]   well, if I can get the side hustle to that number,
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.540]   then I can quit.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.980]   And I never encourage people
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.740]   to actually go take a risky thing.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.740]   It seemed risky to quit your job
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.380]   to try to hopefully start a business.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.420]   It's not what I want people to do.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.500]   And when you realize how much smaller that number is
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.140]   than you expect, you realize it's also more attainable.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.540]   And so I've twice quit jobs and then gone on
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.420]   once I hit my $3,000 freedom number.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.660]   - And so for you, that's 3,000.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.260]   But do you think that gets a lot harder as people age,
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.540]   have more responsibility, family, all that?
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.220]   - Yeah, it just takes longer, right?
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.140]   It doesn't, everyone has their own number
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.620]   based on their own lifestyle.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.100]   So today, I think my credit card bill, I don't know.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.900]   By the way, cool part about eventually getting money
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.540]   is that you don't have to worry about budgeting
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.100]   or worry about having enough for retirement.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.420]   You don't even have to think about it.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.500]   And I think that's available for everyone.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.820]   But I just had to do a CNBC show.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.940]   I think my credit card bill with all things
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.420]   is like 25,000 a month.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.940]   So it goes up over time,
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.300]   but then obviously I've built up businesses
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.140]   and stuff like that.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.780]   But what people are trying to do,
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.740]   if you have kids and I've noticed,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.580]   there's a guy named Jake who ran Million Dollar Weekend.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.900]   He's got three kids, he's got a wife, they got a house.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.620]   So it's not something you can just quit overnight.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.460]   But if you never get started,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.820]   then he's never even gonna get to that number.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.380]   I think for him, my guess, I think it was around $10,000.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.220]   But you have to get started
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.340]   so that you can even get to that point.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.020]   Same as I got started with AppSumo.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.540]   I started with a weekend and I made my first $12,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.420]   my first sale.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.860]   - And so the idea of a weekend, why a weekend?
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.700]   Why not a week?
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   Why not a month?
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.140]   Why do people need to figure this out so quickly?
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.060]   - You have a family, right?
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.060]   You have two kids?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.620]   - Yeah.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.140]   - And you have, I mean, you have this podcast,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.020]   but you have a job and you have a wife to take care of.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.460]   Most people don't have a lot of time, right?
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.780]   It's hard, right?
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.580]   And you're already got, you're already obligations,
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.180]   you got commitments, and you're like,
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.540]   maybe it's just easier to put in the stock market.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.820]   But what everyone has is a weekend.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.420]   Everyone has at least one weekend they can do something.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.500]   Maybe not every single weekend,
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.100]   which is everyone's got 52, but maybe one a year.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.820]   And because we don't have as much time available,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.620]   like how do we find what's just the essence
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.540]   of getting started?
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.740]   And if you can do that in a very limited time,
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.060]   which creates a lot more creativity,
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.060]   I do believe limitation instills creation.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.940]   And when you have this limitation, you're like,
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.500]   well, I'm not gonna mess around.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.420]   And I can't goof around and buy a bunch of ads,
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.020]   or I can't, I don't have time to make a YouTube channel
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.700]   because I only got a weekend to get this done.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.100]   And especially someone like yourself,
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.220]   if you were in that tech job and had a family
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.500]   where you are today, you don't have a lot of time for that.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.100]   And so how do we focus on just the things that matter?
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.420]   And what I have found through myself starting businesses
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.380]   in a weekend and through others,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.900]   this 48 hour time period is the best window
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.900]   to change your life.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.620]   - And how far do you have to get?
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.540]   I look at this podcast as an example,
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.380]   that's now my full-time job and my wife's full-time job.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.260]   - Congrats. - But when I started it,
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.540]   it was like, it was just a side project that I liked.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.920]   It cost money and did not make any money at the beginning.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.940]   You could argue maybe started it in a weekend,
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.060]   but I didn't have those ambitions.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.740]   Where does stuff like that fit into this?
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.660]   - How long did it take for you to quit your day?
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.720]   Did you quit your day job when you started this?
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.420]   - Yeah, I did, it probably took,
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.820]   I started the podcast in May, 2021,
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.420]   and I quit my day job in December, 2022.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.940]   - And how much were you making at the pod
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.100]   that you felt comfortable to quit your day job?
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.340]   - It was about, it crossed to a point
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.300]   that it replaced my work income.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.940]   - That's your freedom number.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.660]   - And so the reality is that in a weekend,
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.500]   you could find out if something that people want.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.900]   And then the other part of success,
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.060]   and you asked about billionaires,
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.420]   which I've interviewed a lot on my YouTube channel
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.060]   and worked for them directly,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.300]   is that you become a billionaire,
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.260]   but you have to do compounded action
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.940]   over a long period of time.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.620]   And most people are quitting too soon.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.660]   So you have to initially find something
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.900]   people actually really want.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.100]   And then you do have to stick with it
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.300]   for some period of time where like at AppSumo,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.420]   I don't think I made my first million dollars a year
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.980]   salaried until year seven.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.900]   I paid myself, I think $0 first year, 40,000 next year.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.660]   And frankly, if I would've just stayed at Intel
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.580]   or any of these other jobs,
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.140]   I probably would've made more most of the time,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.540]   but I kept sticking with it,
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.060]   kept having good results, promising.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:41.900]   And then over time it was like,
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.940]   wow, now we actually have enough,
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.060]   I can take a little bit for myself.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.380]   And then eventually it was like a lot for myself,
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.820]   but you have to start and then you have to stick.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.740]   And you were a great example of that.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.780]   - Yeah, so the goal of the weekend
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.140]   isn't to kind of fast track your way to millionaire status.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.300]   It's to make sure you validated
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.380]   that the thing you're working on
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.540]   could really be big enough
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.540]   to be the thing you want to do full-time.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.620]   - It's recognizing that you can create
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.020]   a million dollar opportunity for yourself
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.700]   in a very short period of time.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.760]   And no, I think in 10 years,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.020]   I believe someone will make a million dollars
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.220]   in a weekend, legitimately,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.980]   not like through drug dealing or something shady.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.660]   - Or that app that was like $20,000 or something.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.380]   - It could be that, right?
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.780]   You could sell pinball machines.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.200]   This is actually, you could totally validate it.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.040]   I love pinballs.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.020]   I got an arcade at my house.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.860]   You could sell $15,000 pinballs.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.480]   And I walk people through business models
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.320]   and such in the book,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.220]   one minute business models,
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.220]   'cause you don't have a lot of time.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.580]   You know, what is that?
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.620]   To make a million dollars selling 15,000 pinballs,
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.580]   depending on what the costs are like,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.540]   you know, maybe you'll need to sell a hundred or two.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.160]   It's not a bad business over the next few years.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.000]   It was actually pretty crazy.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.540]   Do you know Stern Pinball?
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.740]   - No.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.180]   - So let's say you love arcades.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.020]   And this is the thing, again,
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.980]   you can make money in different ways.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.960]   Maybe it's a podcast show.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.380]   Maybe it's videos.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.340]   Maybe it's lawn care.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.900]   Maybe it's games.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.180]   And Stern Pinball,
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.260]   which I think they,
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.820]   I don't know if they do a billion dollars in sales,
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.820]   but definitely in the tens,
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.660]   if not hundreds of millions,
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.400]   it's the number one pinball maker.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.900]   They showed a video about how they make pinball.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.300]   And this is the same stuff I teach in Million Dollar Weekend
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.060]   which I thought was so unique,
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.660]   is that instead of building this whole pinball thing
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.100]   and making sure people like it,
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.100]   they literally take a piece of wood
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.100]   and then they put some,
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.540]   and pretty much the same day,
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.380]   they put pieces of metal on the wood
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.800]   and they throw a ball at it.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.340]   And they see what happens is they throw the ball
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.900]   at this piece of wood.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.600]   And then you realize, wow,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.940]   pretty quickly they can see if the game
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.460]   that they're starting to think of is gonna be interesting.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.340]   And that's the same thing you can apply in business,
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.180]   which is,
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.820]   how can I see if this is something people really want?
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.860]   Maybe it's a show.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.460]   Maybe it's a pinball game.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.460]   Maybe it's gonna be food.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.380]   Maybe it's a software product.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.460]   Maybe it's lawn care.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.180]   So that if I'm gonna work on it for some period of time,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.620]   I know that there's at least customers who are excited
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.620]   to be purchasing it and be a part of it.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.660]   - So what's that process?
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.060]   What's, I mean,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.800]   what's the high level process someone needs to go through?
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.400]   - I was gonna joke, like, well, you get the,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.240]   it's in the book.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.480]   I mean, it's a good investment.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.400]   But no, I'll give it to you for free.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.320]   I'll give it to you for free.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.080]   So if you have to break it down,
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.600]   there's three categories of getting
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.400]   a million dollar weekend business going,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.920]   which is starting it, building it, and growing it.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.040]   And I would say there's so many business books out there,
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.200]   and especially for a lot of your audience.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.760]   You have really good looking audience.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.000]   That's a fact.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.680]   You have a lot of six figure audience,
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.520]   a lot of have kids,
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.820]   and they're probably happy with the S&P 500 12%,
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.780]   or maybe they got crypto lucky,
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.940]   or they bought some silly NFT moon cats,
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.300]   which I didn't, lost a lot of money on.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.560]   But I do think most people wanna have more money.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.260]   And what I've seen from it,
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.940]   there's a start it, build it, and grow it.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.860]   There's a woman who was at Warby Parker named McKinsey,
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.320]   and she dreamed the same thing.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.700]   So the first part, though,
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.940]   is how do you get good at starting and asking?
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.020]   And those are the two biggest things
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.860]   holding people from back from success
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.000]   in really entrepreneurship, but also in life.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.400]   I would say this book is almost as much self-help
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.360]   as it is start a business in a weekend.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.800]   So how do you practice starting right now?
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.360]   'Cause the more that you can get started,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.880]   and let's say you wanna do a podcast.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.320]   Let's put an episode out today.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.980]   I have a YouTube channel, a million subscribers.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.520]   My first video that I did three years ago
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.960]   was with an iPhone 10 and me shirtless.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.160]   And it was just a video talking about COVID.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.000]   Fast forward, today, each video costs $20,000 to make,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.560]   but I got started.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.360]   And then over time, I was able to add maybe a videographer
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.520]   or a little better camera or a little better lighting,
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.000]   a little bit of scripts, a little bit of thumbnails.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.880]   And you stick with it, you keep improving it.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.600]   And then now, the videos are more polished and so forth.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.000]   But you have to practice how do you get started right now?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.160]   Second thing is asking.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.600]   Everything in life is asking, like your wife,
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.200]   you had to ask her to marry you.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.480]   Right?
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.300]   You have to ask for a raise.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.140]   You have to ask for things.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.840]   And so people have a negative connotation of asking,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.760]   and then they have this fear of rejection.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.880]   This really strong fear of, wow, I'm not good enough,
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.720]   or they don't like me.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.120]   And so when we can do that in silly things,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.440]   like McKinsey, so she dreamed of having her own business.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.480]   And so she loved connection.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.920]   And so she wanted to start a greetings card company.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.420]   And it's called merrymakery.com.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.600]   I gotta give her a shout out.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.260]   She's Red Million Dollar Weekend.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.160]   And she emailed some of her coworkers at Warby Parker.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.720]   She said, "I wanna do a greeting card.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.680]   "Does anyone wanna buy some of my greeting cards?"
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.840]   And she asked.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.000]   And the beauty of asking is that you can get what you want.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.880]   If you don't ask, you can't get.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.720]   And you didn't have to build a big website.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.760]   You didn't have to buy domain.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.600]   You didn't have to do anything.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.240]   But you practice this in small things.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.200]   And then in her first year of sales so far,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.280]   she's done $50,000 in greeting cards.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.640]   Greeting cards.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   And by the way, Hallmark has a TV show or channel, right?
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.900]   And they started the exact same way.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.600]   I think people never make their million dollars
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.980]   'cause they don't make their first dollar.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.820]   And they're not making their first dollar
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.640]   'cause they don't get started.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.480]   And they don't realize it can be fun
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.120]   and you can't get started today.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.880]   Now, the second section of the book is like,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.040]   okay, you started things.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:43.920]   You feel good about yourself.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.760]   You got momentum.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.580]   You got the skills.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.560]   Now, how do you build it, right?
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.720]   And so I would say there's kind of three pieces of that.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.200]   How do you find ideas?
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.440]   And there's more than enough.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.400]   And we can go through some today.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.040]   How do you make sure it's a million dollar opportunity?
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.320]   How do you make sure that there's a business model there?
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.240]   And then the part three of the book is grow it,
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.480]   which is like, can we really get customers?
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.520]   And then how do you take it to thousand,
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.680]   $10,000 million and beyond?
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.520]   So let's take an example of that.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.740]   For me, I've found that there's three ways to get business,
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.160]   but let me just show people in the audience
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.040]   one thing right now.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.280]   Let's just do a fun one.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.000]   So for people listening, text someone right now,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.360]   "Hey, what kind of business do you think I would start?"
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.080]   And that's an ask and that's a start, right?
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.280]   You're starting something right now, you're doing it,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.120]   and guess what?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.000]   You're gonna get a result.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.040]   And that's a free business idea
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.440]   that you can already do for yourself.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.600]   And one of the best ways to think about business ideas
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.480]   is what have you gotten paid for in the past
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.200]   or who do you have influence around?
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.880]   Who do you have in your zone of influence in your network?
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.440]   Make it easy on yourself.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.200]   Three other ways, I'll give you three other business ideas
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.000]   in three minutes, in three ways.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.760]   So number one, just think about your day-to-day
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.300]   and break it out, breakfast, lunch, dinner.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.780]   Think of something that annoyed you.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.640]   That's a business opportunity.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   Every problem is a business opportunity.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.880]   Every problem is a business opportunity.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.920]   The other one, number two,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.240]   think about something you spend money on.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.560]   Look at your credit card bill.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.060]   I was really annoyed with DocuSign.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.300]   I keep signing up for new accounts
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.660]   so I don't have to pay.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.300]   So I was like, I'm tired of that.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.260]   And so two weeks ago, I read Million Dollar Weekend
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260]   and I followed the process and I made $3,000 in one day.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.420]   And now in the next 30 days,
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.900]   I'm delivering a DocuSign alternative.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.340]   I don't have a website.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.180]   I don't have a domain.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.060]   I don't know what we should call it.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.280]   People have ideas, let me know.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.120]   But I have a million dollar business opportunity.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.060]   And then the third one is what have you avoided doing?
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.260]   What's on your to-do list that you have not done?
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.100]   There are other ways in the book.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.940]   There's six other ways,
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.520]   but I'm giving you some quick ones
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.580]   that people can start thinking about themselves.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.620]   Now the two other high pieces,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.020]   and again, if you go to milliondollarweekend.com,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.800]   it's super broken out there.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.460]   But next up, is it a million dollar opportunity?
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.940]   Is there at least a million dollars of people,
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.780]   a million dollars of money being spent?
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.280]   And then what does the business model look like
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.580]   for you to actually make a million bucks?
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   And so I was doing lawn care
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.280]   because that's what people told me to start as a business.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.740]   I wanted to prove them, prove how to do it.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.940]   Now, if you do lawn care
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.300]   and you're selling one-off lawn care,
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.940]   you have to, let's say 50 bucks a lawn.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.500]   That's a lot of lawns.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.180]   So by just having a one-minute business model,
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.020]   it's like, all right,
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   well, I need to sell monthly subscriptions.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.220]   And what I aim for in the business model
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.620]   and in general is how hard does this actually look?
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.820]   Like, do I have to sell 5,000 different
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.660]   lawn care things?
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.740]   That's tough.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.280]   Now, next up, you have the idea,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.220]   you've done the typical check on the business model.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   You have to see if you can actually get customers for it.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.860]   And I always recommend three customers in 48 hours.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.580]   I found that if you cannot get three,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.820]   you're not gonna be able to get beyond that
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.100]   after the weekend.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.060]   And there's three ways you can do it.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.500]   You can pre-sell it.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.820]   You can post it on marketplaces.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.580]   So you can post it on Etsy, Craigslist,
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.100]   IndieHackers, Reddit, things like that,
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.860]   where there's people that are looking to pay.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.140]   Or the third way is landing pages and ads.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.940]   I love pre-selling 'cause it's the most direct
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.820]   and you could do it in a non-salesy way.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.420]   You can just get feedback from people
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.820]   that you think you can help.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.980]   So that's pretty detailed about it.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.740]   And then grow it is how do you set up your social media?
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.700]   How do you set up your email list,
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.880]   which everyone should do?
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.800]   And then setting up your growth machine
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.900]   to make this stuff on repeat.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.860]   And that's the million-dollar weekend at a high level.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.580]   And you have someone like McKenzie
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.700]   who quit a very high-paying job.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.220]   I did not recommend that.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.900]   And in one year was able to get to around $50,000.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.140]   And I think people...
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.420]   I have a friend, he works at Amazon.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.660]   He makes 400K, which is very common.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.100]   I mean, okay, 400K is a lot.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.780]   But let's just say 120K or something like that.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.580]   And he started a side hustle.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.660]   And in his first year, he made 1,000 bucks, which is great.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.460]   And he quit.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.300]   He quit.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.140]   And the question that I always think about for myself is,
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.740]   what is the 10 years from now Noah gonna thank me for?
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.460]   And for him, if he would have stuck with that,
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.180]   this is a few years ago now,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.740]   I promise that for him and for everyone out there,
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.440]   if you can find something that actually works,
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.060]   which it was working for him,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.260]   he was making content about food.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.860]   You know, these like food cooking shows?
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.700]   - Yeah.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.980]   - If he would have stuck with it, it was working.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.820]   You know, five years from now,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.820]   that could have easily surpassed the amount of revenue
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.780]   that he's getting in his day job.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.100]   And you keep both or he can have that option
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.060]   to do that full-time if he wants.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I found firsthand,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.100]   you don't have to give it up, right?
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.940]   I was working for 18 months while doing this.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.180]   And when you talked about pre-selling, it was interesting.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.300]   There are some businesses like what we're doing,
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.940]   we're selling, you know, the person who might pay the bill
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.820]   isn't the person, the audience.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.540]   But what I did when I started was I made a trailer
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.220]   and I was like, will anyone subscribe to this podcast
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.100]   after hearing just the trailer?
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.500]   I didn't even make an episode.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.340]   - I love that.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.420]   - I recorded a one-minute trailer, two-minute trailer
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.620]   and was like, this is what this show is about.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.700]   And fortunately, Apple and Spotify will show you.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.100]   Like, did you get followers?
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.420]   Did people say, I wanna see what happens next?
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.020]   So I don't know, I just wanna-
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.860]   - I love that.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.860]   And then how did you, so I'm guessing you follow
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.980]   kind of the same playbook I'm gonna recommend
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.820]   in the book and beyond.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.580]   And again, I think people think it's so simple.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.300]   They're like, no, but I gotta make it more complicated.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.540]   Right, isn't this stuff supposed to be fancy?
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.620]   It's like, yes, it eventually gets fancy, right?
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.780]   Like AppSumo now has a 20-person engineering team,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.860]   20-person plus marketing team.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.580]   But it starts that you just kind of post it on there
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.620]   and then you tell some friends
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.900]   and then you kind of do that a little bit more
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.740]   and a little bit more.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.780]   And yes, there's other parts of the process,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.940]   but I think people wanna not trick,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.580]   but make you believe it's much more complicated
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.180]   and people are further away skill-wise than they think.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.020]   And I've seen so many smart people stuck in jobs
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.100]   that are, if not better than me and skilled,
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.220]   just as good as me,
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.540]   they just have been a little bit more afraid than me.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.660]   And if they just do some small things today,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.420]   I think they'll be shocked at their confidence
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.340]   and their abilities of what they can actually do.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.980]   So for yourself, with your podcast,
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.460]   how did you get your first few listeners?
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.340]   I don't think you just posted it and prayed.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.260]   - You know, I basically, I had like six or seven projects
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.260]   in my life that had email lists.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.780]   And I was like, okay, well, when I launched this thing,
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.660]   I'm just gonna email all these people.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.580]   And someone was like, well, if you do that,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.620]   they might get upset and report you as spam.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.820]   I was like, why do you even have a newsletter?
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.340]   Like, I just have a, you know, it doesn't even matter.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.580]   But they had subscribed and opted into something.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.180]   So I felt, I felt that was okay.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.060]   And then it started when a friend of mine,
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.960]   I told him, I was like, I was thinking of starting a podcast.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.740]   He was interviewing me about something random
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.340]   on his podcast.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.860]   And he was like, pause.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.980]   And then like kind of, he goes, all right,
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.100]   I want you to go home and record a one minute trailer,
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.780]   and then we'll just splice it in.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.620]   Like you could tell, you could split.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.740]   And so I came, I spliced in this audio that was like,
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.660]   all right, so the podcast is called this.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.740]   I only had two days to name this podcast,
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.300]   because, you know, he interviewed me about the podcast,
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.460]   and he's like, I need a name.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.960]   I need you to send me an audio file.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.360]   So I was forced, I don't know if it was a weekend,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.060]   but I was forced in like 48 hours to name the podcast
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.580]   and set up a website and create a trailer
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.420]   and put it up there.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.820]   But I hadn't lined up an interview at all.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.260]   - Well, I think most people get it wrong
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.480]   is that that's what they believe they have to do first.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.720]   They're like, all right, well, I need to go learn
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.820]   how to even set up a website.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.900]   Now I gotta waste time on that.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.100]   And then I gotta pay for domain.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.540]   And then I need to do this and this and this.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.140]   And no, just put out a trailer,
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.140]   send it to friends and see if anyone subscribes.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.820]   If people do, great, now do all these other things.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.980]   Most people just do it backwards.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.100]   And I think that's been a big misconception.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.660]   Like there's a guy, Jake, who read the book
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.580]   and he lives, he has three kids, day job, very common.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.100]   He's had the same idea for 24 months, same idea, right?
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.260]   And he wanted to be a good example to his kids.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.380]   That's what he told me.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.240]   So I read the book and in a weekend,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.540]   which he was like, yeah, it's worth it.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.620]   I asked him what he would tell others.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.420]   He's like, it's just worth it.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.580]   And I didn't wanna, he didn't wanna wonder what if.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.780]   And I thought that was amazing.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.260]   And in one weekend, he was able to validate
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.720]   his golf trips for guys' business.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.620]   What a unique idea.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.780]   And now he has five customers.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.460]   They've paid $15,000, I think $3,000 each.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.180]   And he's aiming to get eight of them.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.500]   And in August of this year,
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.020]   he's gonna take these guys on a golf trip someplace.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.140]   I don't know anything about golf, but some course.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.620]   - Yeah.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.480]   - And I think he's gonna make, I don't know, 5K,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.360]   give or take for himself.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.200]   And guess what?
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.020]   That's the start.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.860]   And that's amazing.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.640]   - And he doesn't quit his job to do it.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.480]   - No, he still has his job.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.600]   And I was like, do you have any social media?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.500]   He's like, no.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.440]   He's like, I have my email address.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.280]   So I think it was like jakemdw.311.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.880]   Anyways, message me and I'll put you in touch with Jake
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.360]   if you like golf trips and wanna have fun with other dudes.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.960]   - Yeah, well, one thing you didn't say,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.480]   but I know you said in the book, 'cause I read it,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.540]   was you have to love the thing
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.700]   and it makes it so much easier.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.620]   Maybe you don't have to, but it really helps.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.300]   So my kind of, I often tell people
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.140]   they're thinking of ideas.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.460]   I'm like, what would you go do for free?
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.740]   Like, what do you just, look at your internet history.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.500]   Where did you spend all of your time?
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.580]   If you love going, researching X, Y, and Z,
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.080]   like, is there something that you could do there?
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.580]   And for me, everyone I knew was always like,
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.540]   you always do all this homework.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.860]   Can you just tell me the answer?
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.260]   Like, I would go to a dinner table and someone's like,
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.380]   yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you know all the credit card stuff.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.620]   Can you just tell me which one to get?
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.900]   Or can you just tell me what insurance is the right policy?
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.140]   And I was like, oh, what if I just did all this research
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.980]   and shared it?
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.940]   Or what if instead of doing the research,
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.460]   I interviewed the people while I was doing it and shared it?
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.900]   And so I think it didn't start with the ambition
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.700]   of being a full-time job or anything.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.580]   It just started as a thing that I liked doing.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.180]   And in fact, it actually started as an idea
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.100]   of a parenting podcast.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.620]   And one of my pieces of advice I'll give people,
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.700]   friends are often too nice.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.540]   And so I told people, I was like,
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.300]   oh, I'm gonna start this parenting podcast
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.380]   'cause right before we had our first child,
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.860]   I got really into going down all these rabbit holes
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.500]   of parenting research.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.660]   And I was researching strollers and I might have,
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.420]   I think that I have the most comprehensive
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.300]   stroller comparison database and spreadsheet
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.100]   that exists out there in the world.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.500]   It's about three years out of date,
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.140]   but for circa 2020, it's the best.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.780]   And I had gotten caught up in the fact
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.700]   that I love doing all this research and thinking,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.060]   wow, I'm doing it on this topic.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.820]   I should start a podcast on this topic.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.300]   And everyone I knew was like, that's a great idea.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.020]   And then I was like, you know what?
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.460]   After we had the kid and we bought the stroller
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.820]   and we bought all the items, I was like,
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.620]   I think I liked researching things
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.140]   more than I liked that topic solely.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.700]   And I was like, what if I just did it about all the hacks
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.140]   and it was just me researching everything
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.980]   and all my friends said, oh, that's so much better.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.500]   That's exactly who you are.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.740]   And I was like, well, why didn't you tell me that before?
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.740]   So I like the fact that instead of texting your friends
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.540]   and saying, what do you think of X?
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.700]   Ask them first, because I've found in the past
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.460]   that if you tell them you wanna do something,
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.140]   they're often either completely dismissive
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.700]   or completely supportive.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.380]   And it's very hard for them to think,
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.620]   oh, well, that's great,
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.580]   but like this other thing might be better.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.420]   - Yeah, I think a common theme I've heard,
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.540]   and again, what is it?
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.380]   Find something you love,
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.820]   you never work a day in your life.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.540]   I think that's said by people who actually like their jobs
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.940]   and there's people who, I'd say 80% don't, that they don't.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.900]   And then what they'll do to avoid it is like,
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.980]   well, I wouldn't wanna do that for a living.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.900]   I like researching a lot, but that's just more my hobby.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.140]   And it's like, you know what happens in business
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:56.980]   as you get going?
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.580]   You don't do any of the actual work,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.340]   which is counterintuitive.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.260]   Like, you know, the last time I got an AppSumo deal?
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.100]   2011, right?
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.500]   You know, like it's been 13 years.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.060]   And I remember someone saying that and I was like,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:10.900]   oh, interesting.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.100]   So don't trade your time for money,
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.500]   trade your money for someone else's time.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.220]   And that's how business happens.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.860]   And if you do enjoy it, frankly, you're like,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.580]   hey, actually, no, I like customer support.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.540]   I like all these areas, great.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.660]   But it doesn't always have to be that case.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.460]   And I love your highlight of find something
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.020]   that you just enjoy doing.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.020]   I always like the idea too, if you have a million dollars,
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.140]   like I send you a million dollars today,
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.420]   what are you doing tomorrow?
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.380]   I am doing it.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.220]   I'm doing it.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.060]   I'm talking about a book
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.780]   'cause this is what I wish I would have had
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.620]   when I was getting started.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.660]   I get to promote deals on AppSumo.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.460]   Like I get to make YouTube content
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.420]   or interview rich people and ask how they did it.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.060]   I don't know, like, I can't believe it.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.460]   Most days, I can't believe this is my career.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.060]   I'd like type on a keyboard and like money comes.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.580]   And then I also recognize that it started as a hobby.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.260]   And I think that's a big thing people don't think of.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.940]   They're like, no, no, it's gotta be,
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.220]   it's gotta be a million dollar crazy thing.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.380]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.540]   Most big billion trillion dollar businesses
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.900]   started as just curiosity, right?
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.780]   Airbnb, one of my favorite examples, started in a weekend.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.860]   They emailed people saying, hey,
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.820]   does anyone want to stay at our couch
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.780]   for this design conference in SF?
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.620]   Someone did.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.180]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.580]   They weren't setting out to change,
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.300]   you know, annoy everybody in the world
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.980]   and make the world kind of cooler.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.180]   And same thing with a lot of these other businesses.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.340]   - I was talking to a mentor of mine.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.340]   Well, I might get back on the show,
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.340]   Andy Ratcliffe, who started Wealthfront.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.260]   And he told me two things that are pretty relevant.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.260]   One, he's like, I've done a lot of investing in my career.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.220]   At the earliest stage,
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.180]   I honestly don't even know if the idea matters at all.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.300]   Like, it's, the idea might change, the idea might evolve.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.540]   People haven't really baked it.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.260]   It's really about, is the person,
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.260]   how excited is the person about this idea
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.940]   and how driven are they?
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.660]   And then he said, and the one skill I value the most
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.300]   is intellectual curiosity.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.460]   He just wants people that are excited about a thing
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.980]   and want to learn more about it.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.940]   And he's like, that is something I really value.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.420]   And so, you know, it made me think,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.180]   oh, we're having this conversation today.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.700]   That was a couple of days ago.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.980]   What are you just curious about?
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.820]   Like, what are the things
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.700]   that you just can't stop thinking about?
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.140]   And how could you solve some problem?
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.740]   I mean, again, I spent a career also in product management.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.700]   It's like, forget about solutions.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.860]   Just figure out what people are having problems with.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.580]   Ask them what's wrong in their day.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.580]   Walk through a friend.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.500]   I love this exercise.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.780]   Walk through a friend's day and just be like,
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.820]   all right, tell me everything that sucked.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.980]   Like, in lots of details.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.820]   Like, okay, you were making breakfast.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.100]   Like, what would have made breakfast less frustrating?
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.300]   Oh, this, I don't know.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.300]   My cast iron skillet's always hot.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.580]   I don't know what the idea is right now.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.660]   - I forgot to turn the stove off, which I did this morning.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.500]   - Yeah.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.900]   And so, I like solving problems.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.340]   But let's take a little turn.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.900]   You mentioned you've interviewed a lot of millionaires,
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.780]   billionaires.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.180]   What are some of the lessons you've learned
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.620]   from all those conversations?
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.380]   - It's been, I've also worked for them, right?
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:06.380]   So, one thing I've noticed is that I think we all imagine
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.220]   that they're better than us.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.980]   And when you actually meet millionaires
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.940]   or multi-millionaires or billionaires, you're,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.540]   nope, not really.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.100]   And that's beautiful, right?
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.540]   'Cause that means that everyone has a chance
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.060]   to create whatever life they want.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.900]   There are gifted people.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.380]   Like, Zuckerberg is definitely smarter than most people.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.580]   Bill Gates, who I've worked for, is smarter than most people.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.180]   Peter Thiel, who I've gotten to hang out with a lot.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.020]   I've gotten to hang out with a little bit.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.300]   Smarter than most people.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.820]   But there's also a lot of billionaires.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.700]   Larry Janeski, I would say he's very smart,
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.940]   but he's also a very, pretty normal guy
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.020]   that I think a lot of us can do.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.420]   Now, I would say some of the things in common between them
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.980]   is that most of them got rich off one thing,
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.580]   but all of us diversify, right?
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.540]   It's actually counterintuitive.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.580]   They're like, "Diversify, diversify."
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.100]   But they only really got rich one way.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.860]   You know, go look at any of these rich person lists.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.220]   You know, it's either real estate or it's tech.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.260]   Now, outside of inheritance,
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.220]   it's almost exclusively one thing.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.780]   They stick with it for extraordinary long periods of time.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   Extraordinary.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.740]   And I think, you know, especially with your show, Chris,
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.980]   we talk about, you know, what to choose for stocks
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.300]   or index funds, things like that, and investing.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.220]   You know, think about compound business.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.260]   So, sticking with something for 20 years.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.900]   Like, you've been doing your show three years.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.660]   Think about it in 30 years, right?
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.060]   Like, how big that will be where each year,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.500]   you're just like, getting a little better at your craft,
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.460]   getting a little more popular,
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.060]   and you just stick with it and stick with it.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.140]   And all these guys got rich to become billionaires
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.380]   in around 20 years.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.660]   Which I think is super, super interesting.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.740]   I like John Paul DeGioia a lot.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.780]   I don't know if all of them were happy.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.820]   A lot of them seemed to have regret
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.540]   that they didn't spend more time with their family.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.100]   And that was, I'm glad I got to learn that from them.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.380]   But I would say John Paul DeGioia seemed like
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.540]   he had the right balance, where,
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.660]   and as I said earlier, you know,
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.100]   the book starts with how do you get good at asking.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.580]   He said that the most important skill
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.140]   that he's ever had is sales,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.900]   which is really asking.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.060]   And I liked his approach of businesses,
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.260]   which he said, find the best product
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.980]   that you really love in a category
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.340]   that needs to be reordered.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.900]   That needs to be reordered.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.660]   And just do that for a very long period of time.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.780]   And so he did tequila, Patron,
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.860]   sold that for three and a half billion,
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.740]   'cause you keep, I guess people keep drinking.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.300]   And then he did haircare, Paul Mitchell Haircare,
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.860]   which you keep using haircare.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.300]   And then I'd say the last thing specifically,
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.500]   especially from him,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.380]   'cause a lot of these guys seem frustrated
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.900]   or seem like they're chasing still more sometimes,
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.820]   which I was like, oh, I don't want that.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.620]   He seemed just kind.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.140]   He seemed really, really kind.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.500]   And I really admired that.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.020]   Like he was kind with me, his staff was kind.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.140]   He was kind to the other people that were filming.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.740]   The day he sold Patron,
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.940]   he gave a $50 million check to charity.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.820]   He seemed genuinely like kind with himself
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.700]   and then kind with others.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.660]   And that's definitely something I've worked on
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.500]   in the past few years, and I love that from him.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.220]   - Yeah, I had a great conversation with Gary Vee
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.980]   about kindness and just how he thinks
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.580]   it's like the most underrated business skill in the market.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.500]   - I think self-kindness is probably underrated.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.940]   I think we're all disgusting to ourselves.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.180]   I think we're really harsh on ourselves.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.460]   And that's something I've definitely worked on.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.740]   I'll try to think of underrated skills.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.860]   I'll tell you, underrated skill is gift-giving,
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.900]   super underrated in business, so, so underrated.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.620]   And as well, like doing the work for people
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.060]   you want to have help from or people you want to ask.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.540]   Like if you want to come on someone's show,
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.180]   like I could have even done more for you,
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.580]   even though we just met yesterday,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.060]   or we connected yesterday,
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.900]   but hey, let me come back with ideas for you.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.860]   Or I was able to meet the people from CNBC,
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.620]   so I'm coming on the show Make It,
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.180]   and the guy loves his new dog.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.900]   And so I asked someone who loves dogs
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.300]   for what's the coolest dog toy.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.100]   And so it's this thing from Fable
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.860]   where it spits out dog food as a game.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.820]   So it's a little gift thing, it's like 50 bucks.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.420]   Like that's going to create a cool relationship for life,
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.300]   that for $50.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.380]   So I think those are kind of two things
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.060]   that I would say are definitely underrated
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.860]   in a business or frankly in life.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.220]   - And what about, I mean, now that I'm just thinking
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.460]   about ways that you've changed your life,
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.580]   how does your routine look on a day-to-day basis
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.460]   in terms of when you're doing business,
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.380]   when you're spending time on yourself,
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.500]   your partner, your health?
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:17.300]   - I think a lot of the morning routine content
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.540]   is very overrated.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.260]   I think it's so overrated.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.300]   It's like, oh, get up and meditate and fucking journal,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.740]   sorry, freaking journal, and then drink whatever.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.340]   I don't know, people don't drink Bulletproof coffee anymore.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.180]   I don't know whatever the new coffee fat is.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.420]   And then, I don't know,
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.420]   jump in a cold shower and all that crap.
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.380]   What I found is just look at the days
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.220]   that worked out well for you
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.980]   and try to have common elements between them.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.780]   So what I have recognized is like,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.180]   I do like journaling on Monday morning, that works out.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.740]   And I've copied that from the book "Artist's Way,"
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.900]   which is amazing if you haven't read it.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.540]   Highly recommend about how to be a creative person.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.580]   So I do that on Monday mornings.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.580]   And I don't eat until 12 'cause it made me feel like,
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.180]   okay, it's good to feel a little hungry sometimes.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.260]   So that's Mondays.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.180]   And then the rest of my week,
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.620]   I don't do anything else before noon.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.460]   That's every day.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.340]   Try to think of high-level things
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.580]   that I could recommend for most people.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.820]   I color code my calendar.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.860]   I think that's probably one of the cooler things
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.700]   that people can do.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.620]   And it's really just showing you your asset allocation
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.100]   or your time allocation.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.380]   You think about it where,
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.860]   all right, how much did I spend with my family?
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.940]   How much did I spend in fitness?
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.940]   How much did I spend at work?
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.100]   How much did I spend with myself?
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.940]   And a lot of my stuff is on repeat.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.140]   So I know that every Monday, I'm gonna have journal.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.980]   It's in my calendar.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.060]   Every month, I have my monthly personal finance review
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.900]   on my Google spreadsheet.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.540]   Let's say other routine stuff,
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.900]   maybe just high-level two other ones
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.700]   that people can copy that I found.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.860]   I do a weekly review on Fridays, every single Friday.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.380]   That's been a game changer.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.780]   Where I evaluate, how did I show up as a leader,
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.420]   one through five, and why?
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.140]   How was my emotional consistency?
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.700]   I've noticed sometimes, like even yesterday,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.820]   I was a little bully, I would say sometimes.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.540]   And I was like, ooh, I don't like that.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.340]   And then the last one on Fridays is,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.540]   what are the three things you wanna do next week?
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.740]   And then every Sunday,
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.020]   I take that three things I wanna do next week
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.380]   and work with my chief of staff to really help schedule
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.820]   and color code the things I'm working on
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.900]   in this upcoming week.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.060]   But I think the morning routines,
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.100]   yeah, morning routines, frankly,
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.380]   just don't drink too late at night
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.580]   and then try to go to bed relatively early.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.580]   That, you're gonna have a pretty damn great routine
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.420]   in the morning.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.220]   I've noticed, I use the Oura Ring
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.700]   and people do a bunch of stuff,
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.340]   but ultimately, it really comes down to that.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.740]   I think counterintuitively, by the way,
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.940]   I think there's gonna be a big trend
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.740]   that husbands and husbands, or wives and husbands,
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.540]   tend to sleep in separate rooms.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.780]   But I think when your partner gets you up,
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.060]   and you're like, oh man, I did not sleep as well.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.100]   But I think there's just too much friction on that.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.020]   - Yeah, there was, I did an episode on sleep,
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.420]   and I can't remember the interviewee,
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.580]   but a couple weeks ago,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.460]   and I asked a question about sleeping with your partner,
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:47.500]   and she's like, I interviewed the world's expert on sleeping.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.740]   There's some book that this person wrote,
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.660]   and she interviewed it.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.900]   I'll put a link in the show notes,
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.420]   but it was all about how do you optimize your sleep
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.420]   when you're also trying to consider the fact
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.620]   that you have another human in the bed,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.780]   and what's the right tactic here?
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.820]   I have not listened to the episode full disclosure,
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.460]   so I can't endorse it. - It's crazy.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.260]   I mean, I think the same thing for Million Dollar Weekend,
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.420]   the same thing about how I run AppSumo.com,
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.820]   and the same thing with these routines is experiment.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.700]   That's all it comes down to,
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.860]   and experiments can fail, but experiments can work,
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.740]   and so I've done 30 days of getting up at five.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.260]   I've done 30 days of no caffeine.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.940]   I've done meditation every day,
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.980]   and then noticing, 'cause everyone's different,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.980]   noticing what's the formula.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.220]   You're like, oh man, when I can go biking in the morning,
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.580]   great, or I can jump in the sauna, great,
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.000]   but when I have a morning meeting at 10, I'm pretty angry,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.100]   'cause I don't feel like I didn't create a business
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.620]   so that I have to do these kind of things,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.100]   or I don't want to,
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.540]   and then just experiment around that
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.140]   and seeing how you can create, frankly,
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.300]   the life and week you want to live,
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.460]   and Jake, who read the book,
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.420]   he said something to me that was really powerful,
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.660]   and I've been thinking about it every day
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.380]   since a few months ago.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.100]   He said, "Have stuff in your calendar you look forward to.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.100]   "Put it in the calendar.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.200]   "Put a date night in the calendar.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.880]   "Put a workout in the calendar,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   "and if you don't have anything in life
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.820]   "you're excited about, put it in the calendar."
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.120]   That really stuck with me.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.940]   - I literally today just put a recurring monthly date night
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.540]   on the calendar, so.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.380]   - Hell yeah.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.980]   That was actually, that was a business
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.180]   from a buddy last week, Date Night Nannies,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.220]   where they help you,
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.580]   suggest either a date night every month or weekly.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.820]   You can subscribe to different amounts.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.580]   Have that as an opportunity.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.340]   Really kind of interesting business.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.300]   - Yeah.
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.500]   Yeah, I mean, I think a big takeaway for me,
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.940]   reading the book, talking to you,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.040]   is just there's this, especially in the Bay Area,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   but this belief that entrepreneurship is a career
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.660]   versus an option.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.500]   I don't know what the,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.900]   the option's probably the wrong word,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.440]   but you don't have to choose between
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.480]   entrepreneurship and employment.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.880]   And if you do, you can punt on that decision.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.040]   Like, there's a thousand things you can do
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.680]   when you want to explore an idea, as you say, in a weekend.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.260]   Like, way before you have to decide quitting your job.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.600]   Way before you have to raise money,
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.840]   build a product, and all this stuff.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.320]   And I think so many people often get turned around.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.280]   And if anyone out there,
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.920]   just because I've taken this phone call like 10 times,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.840]   so I started a company doing financial planning online,
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.380]   and we raised money, spent a few years,
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.120]   and realized that the reason why that business
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.720]   is so hard to build is solely that it is almost impossible
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.520]   to acquire customers at any fast cadence.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.160]   Because people all want to change their finances,
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.300]   they all want to improve their financial life,
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.440]   but they just don't want to do it right now.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.240]   And so, what we learned, in the worst way possible,
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.720]   but I'll come back and I'll give a lesson,
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.920]   is that we ask people, "Do you want to do this?
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.960]   "Put $100 down."
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.040]   And we got all these people to put $100 down.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.320]   And so we were like, "Wow, there's real demand."
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.080]   The challenge is then we said, "All right, let's get started.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.000]   "Do you want to pay the rest?"
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.560]   And they're like, "No, not now."
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.200]   And we were like, "Oh, we'll give you your $100 back."
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.060]   And they said, "No, no, no, don't give us the $100 back.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.240]   "We want to do this, we just don't want to do it now."
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.880]   And converting people off that wait list
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.440]   was almost impossible.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.840]   And so, a lot of these founders call me and they say,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.880]   "Hey, I want to start a company.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.940]   "We want to do online financial planning."
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.040]   And I'm like, "Stop everything,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.120]   "and just find out if you can acquire people.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.840]   "Can you sell this in a way that you could repeat?
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.040]   "And if not, don't go hire the engineering team.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.420]   "Don't go build the product."
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.800]   And it just got me thinking,
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.900]   especially reflecting on the last 24 hours
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.660]   of kind of prepping for this conversation.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.940]   If I had spent a weekend just validating
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.300]   whether there were ways to sell financial planning
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.480]   and close the client quickly, per se,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.120]   I probably wouldn't have even needed to start the company
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.820]   because at the end of the day,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.740]   the challenge is people aren't ready to start now.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.740]   And if you just listen to the problem,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.360]   the problem is, "Oh, I need to fix this.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.440]   "I need to fix this."
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.480]   But if you don't actually take whether,
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.160]   I think it's step two in your process
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.360]   to actually validate that the thing you wanna do
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.880]   will solve the problem and work, you kind of get lost.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.640]   - Especially in Silicon.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.160]   I mean, I don't know how many of your audience
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.800]   is in Silicon Valley.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.720]   - Probably not.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.600]   Definitely the minority, but I'd say sub 5%,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.560]   but definitely my experience, at least.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.800]   - Yeah, I saw this.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.640]   You know, it's interesting
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.760]   'cause a lot of people have heard that advice.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.680]   Like, "Yeah, just go get going."
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.840]   But then they don't, and then it's like,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.760]   "Well, what's happening there?"
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.960]   And they're afraid.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.760]   And so how do we do it in small, fun ways?
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.400]   Kind of almost games where it's like,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.280]   "Okay, if you fail, fine,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.200]   "but at least you're starting to feel more confident."
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.080]   Now, I saw a Silicon Valley company called Artifacts.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.240]   I think it's what it's called.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.000]   Raised three and a half million dollars,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.560]   and they'll film a video of your grandma or grandpa.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.640]   Pappy.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.300]   And I was like, "I could have easily found out
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.560]   "on a weekend, that whole business.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.640]   "I didn't need to raise any money."
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.960]   I could literally, everyone's got a grandfather
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.880]   and grandmother or parent.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.120]   You can contact people in your network.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   "Hey, can I film your grandfather or grandfather?
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.700]   "I'll go to their house or Zoom 'em for half the price,
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.680]   "and I could record and create a memory capsule for you."
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.940]   I could make more than $3 million in the next few years
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.960]   before I even have some complicated Silicon Valley website.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.760]   And it was just a cool reminder
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.260]   that this didn't really apply in a lot of different areas.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.100]   And guess what?
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.320]   If no one wanted it, if I called up,
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   I don't know, maybe I can call up Chris,
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.280]   as someone in my network.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.080]   Like, you have, probably you have parents.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.120]   See if that's a problem.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.640]   See if you even want to pay for it.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   And if you don't, great.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.000]   I didn't go and raise money, build a pitch deck
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.180]   to find out someone, build something that no one wants.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.960]   - Yeah.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.760]   Also, there's a lot of companies that raise so much money
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.920]   that the business doesn't work at the scale.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.880]   So let's pretend that this company goes out of business.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.840]   Might not actually mean it's a bad idea.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.600]   Someone listening to this podcast right now
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.760]   might be like, "Well, let's just start doing this."
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.200]   It might not work at the speed and cadence
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.400]   that investors would want it to be,
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.360]   which is why that company could or could not fail.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.600]   But that doesn't mean it's not a good business.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.680]   Financial planning is actually a great business.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.440]   It's just not a great software business
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.080]   at the scale investors need.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.360]   So, I'm happy that we haven't tried to raise money,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.840]   you know, to turn, you know,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.320]   this into a venture-backed podcast.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.800]   - I mean, the reality, they just, they don't,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.080]   it doesn't always work.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.360]   And people are so close to yeses
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.280]   if they just got some nos.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.600]   Right, like if they just started asking,
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   like, "Hey, I'm going to try this business."
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.440]   Didn't work.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.440]   Okay, great.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.320]   But people are giving up way too soon.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.760]   They're all giving up way too soon.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.400]   And if they could just wait till they,
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.160]   not even wait, keep going, keep going, keep going,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.520]   eventually you will find that thing.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.080]   And, I mean, it took me, I think,
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.400]   20 different business ideas to finally get to AppSumo.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.240]   That finally worked.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.560]   And I was like, "All right, great, it's working."
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.880]   My favorite business is the one that works.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.960]   I'm just going to stick with this.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.440]   And, you know, I would say year after year showing up,
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.240]   it's now producing, you know, great dividends.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.960]   And that's available worldwide.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.480]   - Well, so one of the skills you mentioned
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.080]   was just getting going, right?
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.640]   And I think in the book you say, "Now, not how."
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.480]   Let's talk about that
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.600]   because I think that's a skill that applies
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.880]   whether you're starting a company
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.920]   or whether you're just working on anything.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.160]   And it's a skill I'm pretty bad at.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.240]   So that's why I'm going to ask you
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.240]   to kind of coach me and people listening.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.140]   When you have the mind of,
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.040]   "Oh, great, I need to do this thing.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.400]   "Let's take fitness."
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.960]   You're like, "Oh, I want to start working out.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.040]   "Okay, well, let's go research
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.260]   "what the best training program is.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.980]   "Let's go ask 10 of my friends.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.360]   "Is there maybe a coach I should hire?"
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.960]   It's like, or just go lift some weights,
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.060]   like go on a run.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:24.120]   How do you, you seem like someone who also,
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.040]   you wrote a book, like to do some research,
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.820]   like to kind of put thought behind things.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.580]   How do you contrast that to just get going?
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.600]   - I want to avoid getting going really fast
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.400]   in the wrong direction, right?
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   So the whole concept is how do I get going?
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.240]   See if it works.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.440]   "Great, I'm going to go fast in that direction."
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.760]   So what do you think is the last thing you avoided
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.600]   or you took longer on
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.000]   that maybe you think you have to,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.480]   needed to or wanted to?
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   - I mean, I can think of a few things
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.240]   that I just haven't done yet.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.640]   - What are examples of that?
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.920]   - My wife and I talk a lot about,
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.120]   and I get lots of emails from people like,
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.700]   "Gosh, you have such great content.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.760]   "Why aren't you posting it anywhere else?"
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   If I don't like podcasts, you can put it in a newsletter.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.000]   We started doing that.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.720]   And then someone was like, "LinkedIn might be great."
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.760]   I'm like, "Okay, well, maybe I should go figure out
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.400]   "what the best way to do LinkedIn is."
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.240]   I don't know.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.720]   I'm using a little bit of an extreme, but also not.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.600]   - That's okay.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   - My default is go master the thing before doing it.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.840]   And even though I know that that's the wrong path,
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.980]   the right path would be like,
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.220]   "Well, just write something and post it
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.600]   "and see what people think."
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.360]   But sometimes I have to get out of my own head there.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.880]   And so I'm curious if you have any thoughts
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.600]   on encouraging people who are like,
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.720]   "Well, I wanna start this thing.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.120]   "I wanna think about it."
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.880]   Like, you could just do it.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.640]   - Well, so a few things there,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   but let's just take this LinkedIn as a great example.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.840]   What's held you back from posting it today?
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:59.600]   - Probably not sure what the right format is.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.880]   Not sure what the right topic is.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.520]   Probably a little bit of like,
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.680]   there are professional people there that know me
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.940]   and don't wanna look like an idiot
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.040]   posting something stupid in front of a professional group.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.560]   But I don't know, those are a couple.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.400]   - Those are great.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.000]   And that's super common, right?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.820]   We're embarrassed.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.560]   I remember posting on Facebook
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.080]   and then this person from high school,
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.200]   I knew they saw it and I felt,
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.680]   I really felt embarrassed.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.560]   Like, "Oh, what are they thinking of me?"
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.320]   And that's part of what this is about, right?
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   It's finding confidence in ourself through action.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.800]   And so I guess I would also wonder,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.360]   I think there's a bigger discussion about like,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.160]   is LinkedIn really the most helpful in your business?
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.560]   I think that's a separate thing.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   What would happen if you posted today?
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.800]   Like you take, do you post anywhere?
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.860]   Where do you post anything?
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.480]   - I'm not active on LinkedIn, Twitter,
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.560]   Facebook, Instagram, anywhere.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.840]   - Oh, and how do people even hear about this podcast then?
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.920]   - The interesting thing,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.360]   most people find out about podcasts on podcasts.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.560]   So, you know, word of mouth
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.120]   and being a guest on other shows,
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.660]   maybe some newsletter stuff,
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.160]   but it certainly wasn't Instagram or Twitter,
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.200]   probably for most people.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.000]   Though I'm sure someone listening will write back that,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.220]   "No, no, no, it was for me."
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.060]   - It is.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.420]   And then maybe let's do a parallel.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.640]   So when you finally put yourself out there on the podcast,
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.480]   how did it feel?
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.400]   - I don't know, it just felt natural.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   Like for me, some of these things feel so unnatural.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.040]   Like, I think you wrote something about this somewhere,
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.680]   it's like, I'm not the kind of person
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.740]   who's like always taking pictures all the time
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.220]   and wanting to share them with the world.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:41.160]   So like Instagram seems so unnatural, it's so forced.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.080]   If someone's like, "Just post more photos on Instagram."
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.320]   I'm like, "I just don't want to do that."
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.160]   - It's not what I do.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.960]   And I also think what I would, you know,
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.280]   in business and same with this stuff,
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.800]   and we can go back to now not how,
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.280]   it's how do you do more of what's working, right?
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.560]   And what's working for you is podcasts.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.760]   So I would say, how do you do more of that in the now?
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.480]   Not necessarily like something you don't really want to do.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.560]   Like, yes, I could go post on those areas,
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.040]   but I don't like that either.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.000]   Now, where I see the now not how concept
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.760]   is mostly for people who are not starting.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.360]   They're just not getting started, right?
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.280]   And that's what's really holding back.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.840]   You're already going.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.480]   So going and starting something off in a new direction
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.360]   isn't what makes sense.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.200]   Doubling down on what's working is what makes sense for you.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.120]   And that's what we encourage later in the book,
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.360]   in the process.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.260]   I guess the two things I would say is,
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.880]   you can practice not a how in really stupid things.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.920]   And I've found that really helpful.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.360]   Like practice it when there's something on the ground
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.280]   and you're living in your,
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.560]   'cause you'll go to your closet tonight, Chris.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.400]   I don't know if you're organized,
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.760]   but sometimes maybe your clothes on the ground
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.560]   or you're in the garage and kids left something
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.980]   on the ground and you're like, I'll get it tomorrow.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.280]   And I tell myself, now not how.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.240]   Ah, damn it.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.120]   And the idea with how and now not how
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.400]   is that we are in general thinking about,
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.240]   well, if I want to start a business,
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.080]   I got to do all this stuff.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.920]   It's like, no, just get going.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.740]   Try to find a customer.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.900]   And I've noticed there's a guy named Rico.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.080]   He just started posting online.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.940]   And he said, I made $4.70.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.760]   He just started posting in his Facebook groups and stuff.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.880]   And I was like, what are you doing?
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.000]   He's like, I don't know, just now.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.840]   I'm just doing it.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.720]   I'm not worrying about if people really love it or not.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.320]   And you're doing it before fear catches up.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.880]   And I like doing it in kind of silly ways.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.020]   Something I literally, I was,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.960]   I wanted to live, you know, I live and I do this stuff.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.320]   So I said, let me just do a now not how
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.200]   that anyone can copy.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.380]   So I texted my girlfriend.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.720]   I said, what's one thing right now you can tell me
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.600]   that I can do to improve our relationship?
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.000]   Right now.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.720]   And so she actually wrote a really great response.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.760]   I'm not going to share it.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.160]   But she said, baby, it's a difficult question.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.480]   Dot, dot, dot.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.680]   And that was just cause right in the now
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.040]   I asked for something versus, okay,
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.280]   now let me go to therapy or let me have a date night.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.560]   And then we're going to sit down.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.180]   But just right now I asked for something
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.020]   and I got feedback.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.000]   And you can do that in your job right now.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.680]   You could do that in starting a business right now.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.840]   You can do that in social media right now.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.040]   And I think a lot of times people are like,
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.120]   well, how do I approach it?
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.440]   How do I, don't worry about the how,
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.520]   just get going on the now.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.560]   So I guess, how does that maybe relate to,
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.240]   what do you think is something that you think
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.440]   would actually benefit you and things going on
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.560]   that maybe you can consider as an experiment
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.720]   doing right now?
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:07.360]   I mean, it's funny in the last 24 hours,
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.880]   I did an experiment.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.200]   And so I'll share it because it was a success.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.320]   And I think it's a great story.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.760]   There are a handful of people that listeners have said,
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.120]   you should have come on the show
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.440]   or I'd thought would be interesting.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.680]   And I wasn't quite sure
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.000]   what would be the perfect conversation.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.800]   And so I'll give one example is Dan Pink.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.760]   So he's an author, he's been on the show in the past.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.680]   And I was like, people wanna, we had a great conversation.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.920]   I like his reading, his writing.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   And I was like, I should just have him back on the show
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.080]   as soon as I figure out what the topic is,
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.960]   'cause I don't know what the topic's gonna be.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.760]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.840]   So last night I just,
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.120]   we spoke yesterday about this conversation.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.040]   I just sent him a note and I was like,
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.760]   hey, I would love to have you back on the show.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.200]   We had a great conversation.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.320]   I'll figure out what it'll be about.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.560]   But if you're interested, here's a link.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.040]   And then this morning he just scheduled a link
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.840]   and we're gonna record an episode in a week
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.020]   or maybe two weeks.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.960]   And so I know I'm gonna find a thing
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.920]   and I just needed that motivation to do it.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.080]   So I would say, had we not talked,
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.000]   that would be a great example of something I wasn't doing.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.920]   But because I'd been thinking about this,
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.680]   I just tried to put in the action.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.440]   And I would say there's like three or four guests
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.200]   that are coming on the show in the next month
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.520]   that are all as a result of outreach in the last 24 hours.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.360]   That I was just like, you know what?
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.200]   Let's just do it.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.300]   Like, let's not wait for the perfect time.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:32.160]   And maybe the hint is you just need
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.960]   to constantly remind yourself in practice.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.000]   Like, it's a muscle you have to build.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.880]   And even though I knew I was supposed to do it all along,
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.720]   it was just hard.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   And now I just need to do it more and see the benefit.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.280]   - That's great, man.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.100]   That was cool.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.440]   Yeah, the things are never as scary as we think
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.840]   and they're never as hard.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.760]   And I would say that the book, what really is the book,
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.960]   yes, it's business and money
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.640]   and changing your life in 48 hours,
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.400]   but it's about learning who you can become
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.200]   through business.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.240]   I would say it's like the Marie Kondo of business
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.040]   is what we aimed for, which is, yes, it has mindset,
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.200]   it has recipes, but it's really how do we do things
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.840]   we didn't think we could do and we could live lives
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.480]   we didn't think we could live.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.720]   And that's great that this is that literally
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.000]   the now not how is the number one takeaway from the book.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.200]   There's definitely a lot of other things
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.360]   and tactics and all that other stuff,
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.040]   but we survey every beta reader and it was like,
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.280]   oh my God, I just realized I'm distracting myself
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.240]   from things that actually matter
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.360]   and I can do it much quicker than I realized.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.760]   And especially if you know, someone like yourself,
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.880]   'cause you've got a family, you're busy, all these things,
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.780]   but just getting in the now, just literally doing the now,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.320]   you realize the results that can come from it.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   So that was awesome to hear.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.040]   I'm glad that it inspired you in the now.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.520]   - Yeah, and it takes a while, right?
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.240]   Like you gave plenty of examples in the book.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.360]   You have the law of a hundred,
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:52.120]   like look at some of the most successful business people
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.240]   you talked about.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.600]   You need to start now because it's gonna take,
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.440]   it can take years for things to work.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.040]   - Well, the law of a hundred for people out there
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.800]   is just commit to a hundred of something, right?
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.440]   So a hundred podcasts or a hundred days or a hundred emails.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.400]   And it's about how to not quit too soon.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.240]   The other, you know, and I got to shout you out
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.600]   where the book starts about the power of starting
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.960]   in the upside of asking.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.040]   And you also said, hey, no,
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:16.960]   what about me coming on your show?
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.780]   You have a lot of my,
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.160]   a lot of my content is about entrepreneurship.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.840]   And I was like, I thought about it a lot last night.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.480]   I was like, I liked that he asked.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   'Cause you know, the upside of an ask,
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.520]   you get something that you want.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.160]   The downside is maybe a moment of a rejection.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.400]   And the more that people can practice that skill,
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.000]   they realize like there's a lot more out there for them.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.600]   And they're not just getting what they get,
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.360]   they're getting what they want.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.520]   - Yeah, if you want to go deeper,
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.600]   I did an episode, anyone listening with Aziz Gazipura,
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.400]   and we talked a lot about rejection therapy
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.200]   and like lots of different ways
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.240]   that you can practice getting rejected.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.500]   You've got one where you ask people at a coffee shop
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.860]   to just give you 10% discount
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.100]   or friends to give you a dollar,
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.880]   which are both great tactics.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.260]   But for anyone who's like, let's double click there.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.900]   We're not going to spend 20 minutes on it.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.760]   But that episode went deep there.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.300]   - There's a lot of rejection out there.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.260]   I think people don't, I think, I know,
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.060]   people don't realize how much rejection happens
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.740]   for people that are getting the things they want.
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.820]   'Cause they're only seeing the things they get, right?
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.800]   Like, oh, he must be, it must be good for her
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.860]   because she seems to have a great thing.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.180]   But it's like, yeah, you don't know all the other things
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.340]   that she tried to get to where she is.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.940]   And so I do think it's good in fun ways.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.140]   You know, in the book, we have a lot of these different
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:28.260]   little silly, yeah, as you called it,
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.480]   silly little challenges.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.320]   And guess what?
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.540]   You kind of should be laughing.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.700]   And then throughout the book, you're kind of,
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.540]   it should be enjoyable.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.000]   It shouldn't be this big, scary thing
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.420]   that you have to overcome,
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.380]   but you just have to face yourself.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.420]   And everyone can do that.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.260]   And that's what I'm out here cheerleading
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.300]   to encourage people to do that.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.660]   'Cause I don't want people living what if.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.840]   And I have someone close to me
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.800]   where they feel like they don't have power
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.640]   to change their lives.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.480]   And they do.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.460]   - So you talk a lot about making the ask.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.480]   What about the follow-up?
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.780]   How do you feel about how often you should follow up?
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.120]   What, would you get a no?
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.800]   Can you get a yes later?
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.960]   - I think that's when I'm named no.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.200]   My future kid, my girlfriend is pregnant.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.440]   We were gonna name him C, you know, C in Spanish for Sia.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.200]   But my girlfriend vetoed that name.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.060]   Most people don't ever follow up.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.680]   A lot of times in hiring,
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.480]   I'll just delete after the first email
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.640]   just to see who follows up.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.860]   And very, very few ever follow up.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.640]   Now, just to share a story,
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.900]   you guys heard me talk about John Paul DeGioia earlier.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.100]   But what you didn't hear is that I saw him on the streets.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.200]   I just went up to him.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.320]   I was bicycling.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.140]   I was in spandex.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:36.980]   And I was like, oh my God,
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.940]   I've been dreaming of interviewing you.
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.440]   I'd love to interview you.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.600]   And he said, cool, here's my assistant.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.440]   He doesn't have a computer.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.060]   He said, here's my assistant's number, call her.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.040]   So I call her that night.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.520]   She's like, oh, cool, he's not available.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.360]   I was like, what do you mean?
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.180]   I met him on the street.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.020]   He said, yes.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.000]   I was in spandex, don't you remember?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.920]   And she's like, well, give me a call later.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.600]   And then here's my email.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.220]   I followed up with her every week for a year.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.100]   And then one Friday, she called me.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.240]   And she said, hey, he can meet you Monday at 8 a.m.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.080]   Can you be there?
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.280]   I was like, hell yeah, I'll be there.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.080]   And now that's, you know, that one,
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:11.900]   it was amazing to meet him,
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.620]   it was a great interview of him sharing his story
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.480]   and really inspiring a lot of people in business journeys.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.340]   But you didn't know that I got rejected 50 weeks
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.180]   to get to that point.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.020]   And I asked her in person,
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.500]   I thought this was the most interesting part of that,
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.500]   where I recorded it.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.220]   And I said, wasn't I annoying?
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.260]   Didn't that bother you?
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.460]   Like this guy, excuse me.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.000]   She's like, no, I respected you.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.600]   I admired that you really wanted it
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.380]   and you were willing to follow up with that.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.660]   And you didn't bug me every day,
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.060]   but every week she knows I'm gonna call her or email her.
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.100]   And there's something about that
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.140]   in whatever the things we actually want in life are.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.300]   And so if you can be clear on what you actually want,
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.840]   which is sometimes harder than we think,
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.380]   then it makes it much easier than say, all right,
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.740]   well, at least need to make it easy to follow up
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.740]   'cause that's how you're gonna get the things you want.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.860]   My favorite quote is, you know,
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:01.300]   squeaky wheel gets the grease, which is still strange,
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.140]   but really it's just like,
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.220]   if you're making noise and you're kind of persisting,
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.620]   I do think eventually persistence beats resistance.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.020]   Another one of my favorites.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:09.860]   - Yeah.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.140]   I think you can also probably call out things
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.300]   that you're afraid of.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.820]   So if you're afraid that they're gonna be like,
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.140]   this person's annoying, you could be like,
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.900]   hey, I'm just following up
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.180]   'cause I know this interview is gonna be amazing.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.780]   Don't feel like you need to reply.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:25.620]   I'm gonna keep, you know,
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.540]   like you could kind of couch out some of the things,
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.620]   but if you get someone who thinks they have to reply
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.340]   to the email, it might be annoying,
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.080]   but if they're okay, just archiving it at the end,
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.460]   yeah, keep going.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.420]   - Yeah, there's definitely a difference
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.340]   between no and not yet.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.860]   And what I've noticed with rejection
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.260]   or with asking in general is that everyone's got things
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.860]   going on and it's hard to really know.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.460]   Like we make these stories up about others,
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.580]   like, oh, they rejected me, they hate me.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.820]   And then I followed up with people that are like,
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.340]   hey, thanks for bringing it back to my attention.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.760]   I was really busy.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.600]   Great.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.260]   And so there are tools, right?
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.260]   Like followup.cc and there's Google snooze
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.100]   and there's your calendar and frankly pen and paper,
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.840]   but you know, just make sure you follow up on these things.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.940]   And at AppSumo and personally,
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.020]   even with my own, you know, sales over the years,
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:16.300]   I noticed about half of our sales for, you know,
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.140]   AppSumo as well for myself,
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:19.740]   it's almost half come through the followup.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.240]   And I think that's so insane of a data point
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.300]   where that the first time almost no one's responding,
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.740]   but the second time I'm getting half of the sales,
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.220]   hmm, maybe more likely for others
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.380]   to think about how they can follow up.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.940]   - My sister worked in sales for a long time
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.620]   and she had these automated sequences.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:40.400]   And like the fifth email was one about crocodiles.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.460]   I don't know if anyone listening
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.940]   or you have ever gotten this email.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.100]   And it was just like, sorry about the crocodiles.
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.700]   And the email said, you open the email and it's like,
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.860]   not sure what happened, haven't heard from you,
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.460]   but maybe you got eaten by crocodiles.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.420]   I'm not sure.
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.620]   If so, I hope everything's okay.
[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.020]   Would still love to chat.
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.500]   And she was like, that email killed it.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.260]   Like we did, it was like,
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.020]   after someone didn't respond five times,
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.860]   she would just send this like Hail Mary email
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.100]   that actually got people to respond and close deals.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.760]   - Well, I get these emails too.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.540]   And I find them kinda, I don't know, kitschy a little bit.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.540]   But I think what's powerful for me to recognize,
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:23.060]   I always think the acronym WIFT is what's in it for them.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.360]   And I think when most people are sending stuff,
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.660]   it's like, what's in it for me?
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.600]   You know, it's like, here's my thing.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.260]   No one's ever really making it obvious
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.740]   why it's such a good thing for the other person.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.900]   And what they do also is they do it in the same medium
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.380]   that everyone's doing it.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.660]   So if you're doing a LinkedIn, it's gonna be hard.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.020]   If you're doing it on Twitter, it might be a little easier.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.580]   If you're doing it on email, it might be.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.460]   And so again, I think it's like,
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.800]   what's the medium where they're not getting harassed?
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.020]   And then as you're communicating with them,
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.300]   how do you make sure that, hey, based on what you're doing,
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.460]   I know this is gonna be good for you.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.340]   Like for instance, I do social media.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.080]   You can check that out online.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.780]   People, I get literally, I'm not joking,
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.620]   30 messages a day.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.180]   Hey, can I be your editor for your content?
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.900]   And one out of 1,000 will actually send me something.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.340]   They'll show me, not tell me.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.460]   And they're thinking about what's in it for me.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.180]   They're like, well, I showed you what I can do.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.740]   And that guy got hired.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.900]   He gets a six-figure salary
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.420]   working for me on the YouTube channel.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.300]   So I think there's just different other elements of,
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.620]   besides the follow-up, even the asking,
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.060]   by practicing it, you will get better at the ask.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.300]   - Yeah, I tell everyone I know who's trying
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.920]   to get on podcasts, I'm like, I get lots of pitches
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.840]   and all of them are from people
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.600]   who have clearly never listened to the show ever.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.460]   And then one in a hundred is someone like,
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.300]   hey, I listened to your show.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.400]   Here's an episode that might make sense.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.080]   And I'm like, I'm excited.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.400]   It doesn't always work.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.800]   But I get all these emails that are like,
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.880]   would you like to have an interview
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.440]   with someone who built a career out of buying storage units?
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.040]   And I was like, no, I don't have an interview
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.560]   entrepreneurs about their story.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.200]   I'm like, let's learn some tactics.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   So I don't know.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.960]   - I think it goes so far to do a little bit of homework
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.560]   to make an email actually relevant to the person reading it.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.400]   - Anything.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.600]   I mean, even, let me give you an example on day jobs.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.240]   'Cause you told me that a lot of your audience is day jobs.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.120]   I got, there's two messages I hate most in the world,
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.320]   or there's one message, but it could go both ways
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.120]   that I hate most in the world.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.160]   And it was like, no, we have to talk.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.480]   And that's when I get it from someone who works with me.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.520]   And I'm like, well, they're quitting today.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.760]   And I'm like, well, that's frustrating.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.880]   So I got that message two days ago from Kellen.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.480]   And it was like, we got to talk.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.880]   I'm like, okay.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.800]   She put together a two page document showing me,
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.840]   and I won't share her numbers,
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.680]   but showing me what she's done for AppSumo
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.520]   and all she's created.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.120]   And she said, I know we're going to come up on raises.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.360]   I just want to show you what I've done.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.960]   And based on also data from external raises,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.920]   like might make sense for you to give me a raise.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.560]   She made it very easy.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.080]   And normally you get the opposite words, people quitting.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.560]   When you're at a company, create more value for the company.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.520]   It's very easy to get paid more at that company.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.360]   And it was so cool.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.840]   She didn't just tell me about that.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.920]   She showed that to me.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.880]   - I had an au pair once,
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.720]   the one au pair that didn't work out well.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.120]   And she was like, I want more money.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:07.960]   And we were like, why?
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.120]   And she's like, 'cause I want it.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.000]   And my wife was like, I want, from a teaching standpoint,
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.360]   I want to sit down and show you
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.400]   that you should have come and said,
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.000]   here's all the things I've been doing.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.040]   Here's all this work.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.840]   But it was like the most frustrating.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.160]   They were just like, 'cause I want it.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.480]   - Oof, yeah.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.000]   - It didn't happen, but.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.200]   - No, but just good lessons out there for all of us.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.840]   And like, you know, what is it again?
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.200]   It's an ask, right?
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.080]   And it's a skill.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.640]   Like I knock on doors on these videos
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.440]   where I knock on houses and ask what they do for a living.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.800]   It's very uncomfortable, right?
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.080]   And I still get a lot of anxiety, but I don't ask them,
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.920]   hey, what do you do for a living?
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.440]   'Cause that's a weird ask.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.720]   But I go to the door and compliment them.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.560]   And that's something you can do
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.200]   for anyone you want to ask something for.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.000]   I go to houses I love and I say, I love your house.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.840]   Like, oh my God, really?
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.120]   Yeah, like, tell me about it.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.000]   Wow, what did you do to afford this kind of house?
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:03:59.840]   It's so cool.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.760]   And oh yeah, we're doing a documentary
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.400]   about houses in the neighborhood.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.900]   And I think we create narratives
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.440]   about why people are gonna reject us
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.960]   and we stop before we ever start.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.880]   And that's the same reason, like,
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.400]   I ask people on first class seats
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.840]   or ask to fly in someone's private jet.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.960]   And you'd be surprised at what can happen if you just ask.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.480]   - Yeah.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.680]   Well, I feel like obliged to just make an ask then,
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.520]   just to demonstrate it, so.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.000]   - You did.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.120]   What's your, you did.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.040]   You asked to come on my show.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.640]   - I know, but you already said yes,
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.500]   so now I gotta keep going, right?
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.840]   (laughing)
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.080]   Like, I'm gonna come to Austin, we'll record an episode,
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.420]   and then I'm gonna sit down and lay out my plan
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.380]   for what we're doing with the business
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.520]   and then get your feedback.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.360]   You up for that?
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.180]   - Okay, now you're imposing.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.180]   Now you're imposing.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.240]   Okay, hold on.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.080]   Slow your roll.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.360]   One, I'm flying to Spain in two weeks,
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.920]   so you have to follow me out there.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.120]   But again, I think with ask,
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.320]   people think it is an imposition, right?
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.800]   And they're like, but go back to what's in it for me.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.460]   Noah, I know you're trying to do this content.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.080]   I saw that your most popular podcast
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.520]   were on solarpreneurship.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.620]   I've had a day job.
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.720]   I've started a podcast.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.560]   Here's some of the things
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.960]   that can make it really appealing for you,
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.060]   where most people send generic templates.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.240]   And so if you can think about what's in it
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.080]   for the other person,
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.800]   and you put a little bit of effort into it,
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.760]   like this guy Jay.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.520]   I just hired this guy Jay, 17 years old,
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.240]   lives with his parents.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.720]   He's coming to the book launch party
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.880]   for Million Dollar Weekend,
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.220]   and I paid for a ticket for his dad to come with him,
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.060]   which is so cool.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.440]   I was like, that's just cool.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.800]   And Jay didn't ask me for a job.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.520]   He put together a 30 point Google Slides presentation
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.960]   about everything in my social media and email that sucked,
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.640]   and what he's gonna do about it.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.240]   And now Jay makes more than anyone else in it.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.080]   He probably makes,
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.040]   I don't know if he makes more than all of his teachers,
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.920]   but pretty soon he will.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.240]   Just 'cause he,
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.880]   me didn't make an ask to come work,
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.320]   but he also put in the work to show me
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.960]   why it was such a no brainer for him to get this job.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.800]   - I love that.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.120]   All right, so I know you've talked in the past
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.520]   about being cheap,
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.400]   and that you've been able to learn how to spend.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.760]   I was curious if you had any advice on that.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.560]   - I can still be practical.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.960]   I think we shouldn't label ourselves as cheap.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.520]   - I was using your words that you've said that.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.760]   (laughing)
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.440]   - I was pretty cheap, I would say,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.040]   or practical up until COVID.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.640]   And we're so focused on,
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.480]   I think a lot of our society is taught about making money
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.080]   as no one ever talks about enjoying money.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.760]   And I'll tell you, everyone should at least be rich,
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.320]   and then you can decide if you wanna go back to being poor.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.640]   And I grew up middle class,
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.440]   and I think there's a middle class mentality
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.880]   where you're trained to be stuck in that path,
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.880]   and realizing you can actually get out of it.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.200]   And spending money and enjoying money
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.120]   has been one of the best things the past three years.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.160]   Like I have, I was telling someone two days ago,
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.280]   if my house burned down,
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.440]   the first thing I'm taking is my toilet.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.240]   I've got this like $6,000 Toto Japanese toilet
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   that's just killer.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.960]   Like I don't like leaving my house 'cause of toilet.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.640]   Like my girlfriend now is like, I understand.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.720]   And-- - That's so funny.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.040]   - Dude, when you come over, you'll try it.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.080]   - Fantastic, from Spain.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.800]   We asked her, what are you gonna miss most
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.040]   when you leave America and go back to Barcelona?
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.440]   Or she lives near Barcelona in a town called Tarragona.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.320]   She's like, that toilet.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.960]   - Oh, do you guys have a nice toilet?
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.000]   - Yeah, yeah, she's like,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.920]   I never wanna sit on a cold toilet again.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.800]   - Oh, the toilet, it's got water, it cleans itself.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.440]   But you know, in terms of being cheap,
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.080]   it's easy to not be cheap if you have money.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.920]   But I've also interviewed Larry Janeski,
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.600]   whose company does $600 million a year in basements,
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.040]   who just recently, he's I think in his 50s,
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.200]   he just recently started flying first class.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.160]   This guy, he didn't share his number exactly.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.680]   I'm guessing it's at least worth $100 million, liquid.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.120]   And he flies, he just got a flying economy.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.200]   Now, again, for me in COVID, I realized,
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.240]   okay, I'm not sure how long I'm gonna live here.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.720]   Let me try and experiment different things in my life
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.600]   and see how much of a difference it makes.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.640]   'Cause I was always taught that materialism is bad.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.120]   And if you get more, you're gonna be unhappy
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.640]   and then you become a victim to it.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.120]   And so I tried buying a fancy car.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.000]   I hated it, I hated it.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.120]   I sold it for a loss after a month.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.520]   And then I tried renting fancy houses.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.760]   I rented like this Malibu beach house, which was insane.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.600]   That was super cool.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.920]   'Cause during COVID, everything was like really cheap.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.240]   Then I rented a lake house in Austin.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.480]   Then I rented a nice RV.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.000]   And then I came back home to my 800 foot shack
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.200]   that literally just flooded last night,
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.680]   that has cockroaches and the floors are cracked
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.880]   and the walls are cracked.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.920]   It has electricity and toilets.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.760]   So by the way, it's not horrible, but it's pretty bad.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.520]   And because I tried fancier things and nicer things,
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.680]   I was like, wow, I was much happier there.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.640]   And I would say my standard of happiness has been,
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.120]   the baseline is significantly higher
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.280]   since I moved into this house two and a half years ago.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.880]   - Yeah, I mean, I love this lesson.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.080]   Go try out the ways to spend money
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   because you'll never know which ones make a difference.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.840]   - Yeah, I mean, you know what a rich thing for me
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.440]   is buying Fiji water.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.840]   I don't know why I've actually blind taste tested them
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.320]   and I never choose Fiji.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.360]   So I clearly don't give a crap about the taste of it,
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360]   but it makes me feel rich.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.200]   And it's like, okay, cool.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.360]   That mattered to me.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.200]   Let's do that.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.120]   Or bicycles.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.360]   I think the easy way to spend money
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.440]   is where you spend your time.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.280]   I bike a lot.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.800]   So I have two identical $15,000 bicycles
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.080]   in America and in Spain.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.960]   Or your bed, you spend a lot of time there.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.840]   The thing that ultimately transformed it was one line
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.760]   in my yearly goals.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.000]   And it's a goal every year to donate at least 1%
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.080]   or spend the rest of my money on myself or others.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.720]   And that one goal, which I look at my goals often,
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.760]   transformed my own generosity to myself and others.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.280]   And now it's a lot easier where, okay, I'm donating.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.240]   There was a donate yesterday.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.080]   I literally got an email.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.680]   It's like, I was donating to this camp
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.120]   I went to as a kid, $180 a year.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120]   And they send me a receipt.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.760]   They're like, oh, you've been donating $180 a month.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.160]   I was like, oh, okay.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.360]   Well, that's part of my 1%, that's fine.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.440]   And so whatever I make in the year,
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.080]   at least be open to investing in myself,
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.640]   investing, spending in others or donating.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.600]   And that definitely has been powerful.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.880]   - Okay, so you mentioned your goals.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.920]   How do you set goals?
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.360]   - I think with goal setting,
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.520]   I'd break it down really simply.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520]   One, try to have goals that you stick to each year.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.720]   And each year, they just get a little bit more on the goal.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.200]   So my goals every year in the past, it would be like,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.960]   okay, I did X, now let me go do Y.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.160]   No, just do X plus 0.1.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.480]   And then next year, do X plus 0.2.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.200]   So that was definitely a transformation
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.040]   that helped me in my goals.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.160]   And then I like breaking my goals down in categories.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.720]   And I look at my goals, I'll show you.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.000]   I have them everywhere.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.880]   So on my phone, I have a thing called daily that's pinned.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.040]   And it's just all the goals that I have for this year.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.160]   And so I recommend people have four categories,
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.400]   work, health, personal, and travel.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.840]   And then try to think about what are three things
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.640]   in each of these things that you'd really, really like.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.360]   And the easy way that you could find this out,
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.320]   and this is what I like to do.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.080]   I've done this on a few decades since work for me,
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.760]   is write your fantasy.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.640]   So create a fantasy novel of the year.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.960]   Just go to your journal in the morning and be like,
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.400]   okay, if it's the end of December 31st, 2024,
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.160]   or this year, or 2020, whatever,
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.760]   what does my fantasy look like?
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.440]   All right, I was on Joe Rogan.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.800]   All right, all the hacks finally I posted on LinkedIn.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.600]   I'm a LinkedIn influencer, which LinkedIn is pretty annoying.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.600]   Let's just be real, it's super annoying.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.720]   I took my wife on a baby moon to the Maldives,
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.880]   which seems like a far flight.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.720]   So let's go somewhere else.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.920]   Maybe, I don't know, Tenerife, who knows.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.960]   I want to bike across the Alps, right?
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.640]   And you make this crazy story of yourself,
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.360]   and then sit with it for a little bit,
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.840]   and then think about, okay, what would be really cool?
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.480]   What are these, do I really, am I genuinely motivated?
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.880]   And then I try to have three per each of these categories.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.640]   And I like sharing mine with others.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.880]   I have an accountability partner,
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.960]   Adam Gilbert from mybodytutor.com.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.080]   And then I review them every single Sunday
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.240]   as part of that weekly review thing I do.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.640]   - Love it, so helpful.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.560]   We've gone through so much,
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.040]   and I want to inspire people to go and do something.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.120]   Doesn't have to be this weekend, but some weekend.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.240]   I got a chance to read the book before it comes out,
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.120]   but I highly encourage people to check it out.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.800]   Where do you want to send people to check out more
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.040]   of everything you're working on or the book?
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.480]   - Yeah, milliondollarweekend.com.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.840]   Take the 48-hour challenge.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.240]   Like, there's never a good, you know,
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.160]   it's the same thing with diets.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.160]   There's never a good time for a diet.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.400]   (laughing)
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.080]   And it's easy to keep giving excuses
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.680]   about why it's not right, and you know,
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.280]   I think if people even committed an hour
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.880]   this upcoming weekend, it would be surprising
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.200]   and amazing how far ahead they can be, you know,
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.720]   and what they can do in just a very short amount of time.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.800]   - I love it.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.640]   Thanks for sharing it with me.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.920]   Thanks for being here.
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.240]   - I'll see you at my house.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.840]   I guess you're coming over.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.760]   - Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.240]   Unannounced, knock, knock.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.320]   I like your house.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   - Hey, we have a new video.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.160]   I'm like, oh.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
