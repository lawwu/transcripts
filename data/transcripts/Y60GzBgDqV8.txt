[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   This is the big news in the commodity markets right now is
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.520]   this parabolic spike in cocoa prices. Cocoa is moved in price
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.060]   from about 2000 bucks a ton, which is where it normally
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.720]   trades at to $10,000 a ton. So here's all the cocoa production
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.920]   73% of its in Africa, mostly in Ghana and Ivory Coast cocoa is
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.680]   grown from the cacao tree when you eat a Hershey's bar, for
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.240]   example, 11% of that bar is ground up cocoa powder. So in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.600]   Q4 of last year, El Nino spiked like crazy. And that caused a
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.800]   lot of rainfall to hit the west coast of Africa. And as a
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.120]   result, this fungus was spread in cocoa trees, there's a fungus
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.760]   called black pod disease. So now if you look at the cocoa
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   production out of Ghana, you can see that we've seen a 50% rough
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.000]   decline in cocoa production. So when that happened, everyone
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   started to corner in the market, and then all the short sellers
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.520]   got squeezed and it causes big parabolic jump in price chocolate
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.620]   companies, they're talking about cutting the size of their
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.360]   chocolate bars, raising prices and starting to use other
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.760]   ingredients. So you'll start to see that happen in the shelves
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.120]   in the next couple of months.
