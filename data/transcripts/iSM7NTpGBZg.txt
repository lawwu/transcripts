[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940]   Today's question is about books and it comes from a listener named Roger.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.420]   Hello, Pastor John, in your solid, joyous devotional, Ignorance Leads to Ungodliness,
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.060]   you exhorted us to "read, read, read, but beware of wasting your time on theological
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.400]   foam and suds, read rich doctrinal books about the one who called you to
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000]   his glory and excellence."
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800]   So could you please make some recommendations of the books you are referring to?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.740]   How do I make the distinction between theological suds and theological substance
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.380]   as I build my personal library?
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.880]   Okay, this is really risky because I'm sure I'm going to forget some books that I
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.380]   myself regard as more important than the ones I'm going to mention here, because
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.180]   that's just the way my memory works.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.360]   But it might be worth the risk anyway to get some people started.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.660]   It's like a snowball.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540]   Reading is like a snowball, right?
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.400]   Going down a hill.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.300]   When you read a few really good books, those books generally point you to others
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.860]   and those others to others, and pretty soon you're well on your way to a life of
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.220]   consistent personal growth.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.220]   But let me stress at the outset, before I mention any books, that I don't think
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.320]   reading many books is important.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.660]   Not for the average person anyway, maybe for the scholar, but not for the average
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.040]   person.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.620]   Reading good books, solid books, non-sudsy books, but substantial books really well
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.100]   is important.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.340]   And if you wonder what I mean by reading really well, one place to start is
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.620]   Mortimer Adler, that's the author, How to Read a Book.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.660]   Not a new book.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.760]   I read it for the first time after my college days.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.340]   Ah, I wish I'd read that book earlier, but I'm so glad I read it in my early
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.260]   twenties.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.700]   How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.300]   If you want to go deep with how you read, you'll be inspired and helped by that
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.500]   book.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.300]   So let's begin by grouping some books, and I'll just name what came to my mind in
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.420]   some categories, and you can go from there.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.900]   Let's start with biography.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.620]   I love biography.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.940]   I think biography is one of the most efficient ways to learn about history and
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.860]   theology and psychology, all the while in the form of a good story.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.900]   At least the best biographies are amazing in this regard.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.020]   So here are a few.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.500]   Roland Bainton, Here I Stand, a biography of that epic-making Martin Luther in the
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.260]   1500s.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.980]   David Danielle, biography of William Tyndale, who translated the Bible from
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.380]   Greek into English for the first time in the 1500s and was killed for it.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.500]   It's an amazing glimpse into the kind of Christianity that burns people alive for
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.540]   reading the English Bible.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.660]   I mean, you've got a taste that we have had periods of history in which Christians
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.660]   burned Christians for reading the Bible.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.700]   Oh, David Danielle, William Tyndale, great story.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.020]   Ian Murray, biography of Jonathan Edwards.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.580]   Ian Murray, The Forgotten Spurgeon.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.900]   Murray is an unusually effective storyteller because there is always life and
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.180]   there's always doctrine, and yet you never feel like he's just using the story to
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.500]   teach the doctrine, but the doctrine really does create amazing stories.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.860]   One more biography.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.940]   St. Augustine died 430, probably the most influential Christian in history outside
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.780]   the Bible, his Confessions.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.860]   This is the longest prayer you will ever read.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.220]   I thought, "I want to write a book that's 300 pages long that the whole thing is
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.060]   addressed to God."
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.460]   Well, taste and see what Augustine does there for the celebration of sovereign
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.780]   grace in his lecherous early life and what God made of him.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.020]   Second category I would give is missions.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.100]   I know it's a biography, but I'm putting in the missions to the Golden Shore, the
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.660]   life of Adoniram Judson, went out from America.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.700]   I think the first, at least the first white American, I think there was a black
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.420]   woman who went to Hawaii before him as a missionary, but first white missionary to
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.220]   outside America, to Burma, where he almost went insane with grief and loneliness.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.940]   What a great story of Adoniram Judson by, oh shoot, did I not, Courtney Anderson.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.660]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.580]   John Patton autobiography.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:21.300]   This book is worth it just for the first few pages with his magnificent farewell
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   scene from his father.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.980]   Unforgettable, beautiful scene where a father loves a son, sends him off knowing,
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.180]   "I may never seen this boy again, and he's doing exactly what I want him to do."
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:43.620]   Hudson Taylor's Spiritual Secret, written by his son and daughter-in-law.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.220]   And here you get inside the founder of the China Inland Mission, and getting
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.980]   inside Hudson Taylor is a great place to get.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.660]   Elizabeth Elliott's biography of Amy Carmichael called A Chance to Die.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.180]   And this is good, not only because Amy Carmichael was a one of a kind woman and
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.900]   missionary, but because you get a taste of Elizabeth Elliott.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:15.980]   Elliott was, to my mind, just almost in a class by herself in 20th century women
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.780]   because of the amazing combination of gifts that she brought.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.340]   And if the women who are listening would like a longer list of books that are
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.140]   worthy about women, I would suggest you go to Nancy DeMoss Walgamuth's article
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.980]   at TGC.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.460]   I think it's called On Your Shelf.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.700]   There's a whole bunch of books there.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.300]   I mean, a whole bunch of people there who they ask what books are on your shelf.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   And Nancy DeMoss Walgamuth has listed a lot of biographies of worthy women there.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.260]   Here's another category, Reformed Theology or Reformed Vision of Reality.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.740]   Go to J.I.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.300]   Packer's Knowing God.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.380]   Get J.I.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.260]   Packer's Quest for Godliness, which is a collection of shorter writings.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.940]   You don't have to read it.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.980]   You don't have to read it straight through.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:15.700]   In fact, in that book, John Owen's Death of Death and In the Death of God,
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:23.420]   Packer's introduction to John Owen's Death of Death is probably one of the most
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.660]   influential short essays in the contemporary Reformed resurgence,
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:36.620]   catapulting many of us from a fledgling love of God's sovereignty into a more
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:43.340]   full and robust appreciation for the truth of God's sovereign grace.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:53.220]   Glory Road, edited by Anthony Carter, subtitled The Journeys of Ten African
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.780]   Americans into Reformed Christianity.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.820]   This is valuable not only because the stories themselves are fascinating and
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:12.220]   helpful, but because these ten brothers become portals into African American
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.980]   authors that you may know nothing about and may be worthy of following up on.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:24.340]   Jonathan Edwards' book, Religious Affections, in a class by itself, in my
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:31.740]   judgment, for elevating and clarifying the role of the affections or the
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.940]   emotions in the Christian life.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:40.100]   It was a shocking and glorious read for me, sitting in a rocking chair on many
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.980]   Sunday evenings in Munich, Germany, years ago.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.420]   If you want the best short thing that Jonathan Edwards has ever written, or the
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.300]   most seminal, I would say, A Divine and Supernatural Light.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.100]   It was a sermon.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.500]   You can read it in an hour or less, and you can find it online.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.300]   A Divine and Supernatural Light immediately communicated to the soul.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.540]   If there's one thing that Edwards wrote that I would recommend that's short,
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.380]   that's where I would go.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:15.020]   The next category would be salvation, and I would point you to John Stott, Basic
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:22.140]   Christianity, John Stott's book on the cross, John Murray, Redemption Accomplished
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.860]   and Applied.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:30.140]   Oh, I remember reading that in my early 30s, that just the title to understand
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.180]   what it means that there's redemption and an accomplished stage and an applied
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.620]   stage, what that means in God's sovereign way of working in our lives.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.460]   And then I've got a category called Christian Life, and I would give you a
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:49.940]   Puritan, Jeremiah Burroughs, The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment, as a
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.940]   sampling of all those Puritan paperbacks that Banner of Truth has done, all of
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.860]   them worthy of our attention.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:02.260]   Spurgeon has written so much, you can't begin to read it all, but let me point to
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.820]   two essays in his lectures to his students, and they're probably available
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:13.340]   online separately, The Blind Eye and the Deaf Ear, How to Handle and Survive
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.220]   Criticism in the Ministry or Anywhere.
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:22.020]   If you want to know how to navigate life when you are a controversial person, you
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.740]   need to have a blind eye and a deaf ear, and read what Spurgeon means by that.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:32.100]   And the other one is The Minister's Fainting Fits, an old-fashioned title for
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.820]   how do you deal with depression and discouragement?
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.740]   I mean, you will be really encouraged by that short piece by Spurgeon called The
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.780]   Minister's Fainting Fits.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.620]   And let me end maybe with a few fiction.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.900]   John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, probably has sold more books than any
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.060]   other book outside the Bible.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.940]   There may be one or two.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:58.420]   I don't know how Harry Potter is doing in relation to John Bunyan, but
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:04.740]   historically, The Pilgrim's Progress is just off the charts, helpful and
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.740]   influential.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.100]   If you've never read that classic, go there.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.780]   C.S. Lewis, the Narnia children's books.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.700]   I read them first in my mid-30s, believe it or not.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.460]   I didn't grow up in a home that even knew about C.S.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.580]   Lewis. I didn't read them as a kid, but oh, how we read them and our children loved
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.020]   them. And I loved them in my mid-30s.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.020]   So the children's books called The Chronicles of Narnia.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:35.140]   And then there's the Space Trilogy for an adult taste where you can see what Lewis
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.500]   does with science fiction in a contemporary cultural criticism.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   And then just one more, Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:49.620]   And probably this is in my mind because I read it as a junior in high school.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.820]   And I don't remember what impact it had, but I remember being riveted by it.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.420]   Just recently, I listened to it again and found it.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:07.180]   Oh, my, this is why Dostoevsky, the Russian novelist, is so compelling because of his
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.180]   penetrating insights into the human soul for its evil and its good and how those are all
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.140]   tangled up together.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.580]   Let me close with another warning.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.820]   Beware of reading for quantity to impress anyone.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.420]   Read for your soul.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:34.220]   If we could live a thousand years and experience a thousand relationships in the
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.300]   thousand times and places and cultures that offer themselves, perhaps we wouldn't need
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.660]   books in order to become wise.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:51.740]   But our lives are short, and God has been merciful to give many places, many times,
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.660]   many cultures, many insights distilled into books.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.980]   So find the ones that strengthen your faith and make you want to live all out for God.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.980]   Amen.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.220]   That's quite a library starter, Pastor John.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:05.700]   Wow.

[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.820]   from a listener who wants to know how she can find joy in God each morning.
