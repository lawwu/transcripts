[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.200]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.580]   They're selfish and they are senseless.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.620]   They parade their shame.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.560]   What they should be ashamed of, they parade.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.100]   This whole culture does that.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.700]   The internet is just full of it.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.900]   And we're warned in Hebrews 3 and 4,
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.960]   don't harden your heart, don't harden your heart.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.360]   It's deadly.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.380]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.280]   For I determined to know nothing among you
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.880]   except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:01:04.220]   We live between God's judgment and God's salvation.
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.220]   We live between...
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.860]   We live between divine wrath and divine mercy.
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.120]   That's what human history is.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.700]   Human history is full of judgment.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.920]   From the time of the fall in the garden,
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.600]   judgment fell, death came.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.660]   Human history is the chronicling
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.960]   of all the relentless judgment of God
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.820]   on the unrighteous and the ungodly.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.760]   But at the same time,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.740]   history is the story of God redeeming His people.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.140]   So we find...
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.600]   We find ourselves, along with everybody else in human history,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.680]   living between God's judgment on the unrighteous
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.360]   and God's mercy on the righteous.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.160]   And God knows exactly what He is doing.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.020]   And I will point that out to you in 2 Peter, chapter 2.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.760]   2 Peter, chapter 2.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.720]   The text of this passage is focused on judgment,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.780]   but I'd just draw your attention to verse 5,
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.380]   where it talks about,
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.940]   where it talks about,
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.220]   God not sparing the ancient world.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.220]   And it refers to the flood
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.020]   that basically drowned the whole world
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.940]   except eight people, the family of Noah.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.840]   When that judgment fell
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.860]   and God didn't spare the ancient world,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.780]   He preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.960]   with seven others
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.040]   when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.200]   And then in verse 6,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.800]   when God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.740]   to destruction by redeeming them,
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860]   by reducing them to ashes,
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.420]   having made them an example to those
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840]   who would live ungodly lives thereafter,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.740]   He also, in verse 7, rescued Lot,
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.180]   who was oppressed by the sensual conduct
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.920]   of unprincipled men.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.820]   God drowned the world and protected Noah and his family.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.720]   God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and protected Lot.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.360]   And that is because of verse 9.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.540]   The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.540]   and to keep the unrighteous from the world.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.540]   He has saved the unrighteous under punishment
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540]   for the day of judgment.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.540]   That's the separation that essentially tells the story
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.540]   of human history.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.540]   Judgment on the ungodly and rescue and salvation
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.540]   on those who are righteous.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.540]   In the Old Testament, we find a wonderful passage
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.540]   in the very last book of the Old Testament
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.340]   that leads us to this same understanding.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.340]   The book of Malachi, the final book in the Old Testament,
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.340]   and judgment has been proclaimed.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.340]   And there's a response among the people
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.340]   who are faithful to God.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.340]   And we see that response in verse 16 of Malachi 3.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.340]   "Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another."
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.340]   They were talking about what's going to happen to us.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.340]   This judgment is going to come.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.140]   "And the Lord gave attention and heard it.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.140]   And a book of remembrance was written before Him
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.140]   for those who fear the Lord and who esteem His name.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.140]   'They will be Mine,' says the Lord of hosts,
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.140]   'on the day that I prepare My jewels,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.140]   My own possession,
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.140]   and I will spare them as a man spares his own son
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.140]   who serves him.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.140]   So you will again distinguish between the righteous
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.140]   and the wicked, between one who serves God
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.140]   and one who does not serve Him.'"
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.940]   That's always the dividing line.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.940]   In human history, that is the dividing line in all of humanity.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.940]   History is the story of judgment and salvation,
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.940]   wrath and reward, condemnation and forgiveness.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.940]   The division comes between the children of wrath
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.940]   and the children of mercy.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.940]   They live in two kingdoms: the kingdom of darkness
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.940]   and the kingdom of light, which is the kingdom
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.940]   of God's beloved Son.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.940]   The difference between the two is not superficial.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.740]   The difference between the two is profound and far-reaching.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.740]   Because salvation is such a radical transformation.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.740]   The distinction between those who are in the kingdom of darkness
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.740]   and those in the kingdom of light is salvation.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.740]   It isn't just something God declares to be true.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.740]   It is manifest in the transformation of those individuals
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.740]   who are redeemed.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.540]   I show you that by drawing you back to the beginning
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.540]   of the book of Ephesians.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.540]   I'm going to go back to the second chapter of Ephesians,
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.540]   which we covered months ago.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.540]   But this is a great illustration of it and fits wonderfully
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.540]   with what we'll see in Ephesians 4 in a moment.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.540]   So you see in Ephesians 2, verse 1,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.540]   "You were dead in trespasses and sins."
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.540]   Now, you can't use a more perfect metaphor
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.340]   for the human condition than "dead."
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.340]   The worst thing that can happen to somebody
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.340]   when you're dead is nothing worse can happen to you.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.340]   And that is the metaphor that is chosen to describe humanity:
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.340]   dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.340]   Verse 2: "You formerly walked according to the course of this world,"
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.340]   which is the system of Satan,
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.340]   "according to the prince of the power of the air,"
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.340]   who is Satan, the spirit working in the sons of disobedience.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.340]   That's a description of all the human race.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.140]   And we all live that way,
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.140]   "we are formerly," verse 3 says, "in the lusts of our flesh,
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.140]   and we're by nature children of wrath, even as the rest."
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.140]   Everybody, children of wrath.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.140]   But, verse 4, "God, being rich in mercy
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.140]   because of His great love with which He loved us,
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.140]   even when we were dead in our transgressions,
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.140]   made us alive together with Christ.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.140]   By grace, you have been saved and raised us up with Him
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.940]   and seated us with Him in the heavenly places
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.940]   in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.940]   He might show the surpassing riches of His grace
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.940]   in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.940]   For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.940]   that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.940]   not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.940]   For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.940]   for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.940]   so that we would walk in them."
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.740]   Compare the difference between verses 1 to 3 and verse 10.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.740]   Verse 1 to 3, we're walking according to the course of the world,
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.740]   under the power of the prince of the air,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.740]   the spirit working in the world, the fallen world.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.740]   We are sons of disobedience.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.740]   We live in the lusts of our flesh, desires of the flesh,
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.740]   and by nature are children of wrath.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.740]   But we come down to verse 10, and all of a sudden
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.740]   we have been recreated in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.740]   which God had beforehand prepared so that we would walk in them.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.540]   That's talking about
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.540]   a massive transformation in salvation.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.540]   It causes a spiritual separation from what we were.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.540]   That is dramatic and manifest.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.540]   Now that is what Paul is going to be presenting to us in chapter 4.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.540]   So go to chapter 4, our text before us,
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:33.340]   and I want to read verses 17 to 24, Ephesians 4:17 to 24.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.140]   "So this I say, or therefore I affirm together with the Lord,
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:45.140]   that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding,
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.140]   excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them,
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.140]   because of the hardness of their heart.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.140]   And they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.140]   for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:09.140]   You did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.140]   and have been taught in Him just as truth is in Jesus,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.940]   that in reference to your former manner of life you laid aside the old self,
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.940]   which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.740]   And you were renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new self,
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.940]   which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.940]   The difference between the description of the old self
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.940]   and the description of the new self is stark.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.940]   It's massive.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.940]   You go from being operating in the futility of your mind,
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.940]   darkened in your understanding, excluded from the life of God.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.940]   Now in the first part of what I read, verses 17 and 19,
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.940]   you have a description of the way things are.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.740]   But in between 17 and 19, which describes the whole world in sin,
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.740]   and verses 22 to 24, which describe the saints, is verse 20 and 21,
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.740]   and that speaks of salvation.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.740]   Salvation is the dividing point.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.740]   "You did not learn Christ in this way,
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him just as truth is in Jesus."
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:32.540]   And it's another way of saying, "If you're saved, you don't live that way."
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.540]   You don't live that way.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.540]   The dividing line between sinners and saints,
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.540]   sons of God and sons of the devil,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.540]   the righteous and the unrighteous
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.540]   is expressed in learning Christ,
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:55.540]   hearing Him, being taught in Him the truth that is in Jesus.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:01.540]   All those words are referring to the gospel.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.340]   And by the way,
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.340]   the language here refers to an action in the past.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.340]   This is looking at conversion,
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.340]   at an action in the past when, by the power of God,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.340]   the Ephesian Christians first heard the gospel,
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.340]   listened to it, they were taught the truth concerning Christ,
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.340]   and they learned Christ.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.340]   They learned Him in the sense of real faith,
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.340]   and they were transformed.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   Because there's such a dramatic change,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.140]   Paul refers to
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.140]   the former life in verse 22 as the old self,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.140]   and post-salvation, verse 24, the new self.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.140]   Literally, you go from death to life.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.140]   So, verses 20 and 21 look at the work of God in salvation,
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.140]   and that is what transforms people from what they were,
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.140]   verses 17 and 19, to what they are in Christ,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.140]   22 to 24.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.140]   The moment of your salvation is the transformation miracle.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:14.140]   Not a process, not a process.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.140]   It's an event.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.140]   It's a divine, supernatural event in which you were transferred
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.140]   from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of God's dear Son,
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   in which you ceased to be a member of the children of Satan,
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.940]   and you became a member of the family of God.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.940]   It all happened in the moment of your salvation.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.940]   And because this saving work is so dramatic,
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.940]   go back to chapter 4, verse 17.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.940]   Paul begins this passage by saying,
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.940]   "Therefore, and I affirm together with the Lord,
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.940]   you no longer walk just as the Gentiles also walk."
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.940]   You can't live that way anymore.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.940]   You didn't learn Christ in that way.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.940]   You can't live that way anymore.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.940]   You can't.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.940]   You've been transformed.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.940]   You've been transformed.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.940]   If you're a true believer, you are living in that transformation.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.940]   And it is marked by your love for the Lord,
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.940]   your desire to worship Him,
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.940]   your love for those He loves,
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:28.940]   and obedience to His law with joy and delight.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.940]   Why is the world such an evil, chaotic, dark, demonic place?
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.940]   Why is the world such an evil, chaotic, dark, demonic place?
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.940]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.940]   I checked this week a journal of psychology,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.940]   and they agreed that everybody's basically good.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.940]   So you can wipe out that field.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.940]   So you can wipe out that field.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.940]   What's wrong with everybody is laid out here.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   What's wrong with everybody is laid out here.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.940]   What's wrong with everybody is laid out here.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.940]   And you're not going to be saved.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.940]   You're not going to be saved.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:00.700]   What's wrong with everybody is laid out here.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.140]   This has to be understood.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.140]   You're different.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.140]   You're new.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.640]   This is the testimony of Paul, by the way, according to verse 17, and also the testimony
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.380]   of the Lord.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.560]   The Lord affirms this.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.780]   Now look at the word "Gentiles."
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.380]   You no longer walk as the Gentile.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.940]   That's ethne, ethnicities.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.940]   Again, there's only one race.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.940]   There's only one religion.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.700]   There's only one race, and there are many ethnicities.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.420]   Only one human race in various shades of brown, depending on how much melon you have or don't
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.560]   have.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:44.140]   But there is not only unity over the physical nature in humanity, there is unity over the
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.600]   spiritual nature of humanity.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.940]   They are all sinners, the whole human race, the whole human race.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:02.220]   Well, because of the calling that we have received from God, because of the unity we
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:08.800]   have in the truth, because of the truth that is written and the truth incarnate in Christ,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.180]   because of the privileges of being granted spiritual gifts, because we have been graced
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.260]   by God to be a part of the body of Christ, because of the presence of the Holy Spirit
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.600]   conforming us to Christ - everything He's been talking about in the first part of chapter
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.520]   4.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.700]   Because of the responsibility to speak the truth in love, we can't live the way we used
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   to live.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.480]   You can be sucked back in.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.700]   You can be drawn back in.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.700]   It will never be the pattern of your life.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.640]   It will never be the unbroken pattern of your life.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:46.760]   But the corrupt world tries to seduce you, tries to pull you in, but you'll never again
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.300]   become a slave of sin.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.440]   You've been transformed.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.100]   John said in 1 John 18, "You are a slave of sin.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:05.380]   1 John, "If anyone goes out from us, it only manifests they never were of us, because You're
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.420]   a new creation, and that's eternal."
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:20.500]   All ethnicities are hostile to God, all ethnicities, dominated by pride, greed, lust, selfish pleasure.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:27.180]   The whole human race, including us before our conversion.
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:33.380]   Now Paul's going to dig down a little bit into the condition of every human being, and
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:38.660]   he's going to give us some specific descriptives.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.540]   There are four of them here.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:50.460]   We can sum them up in these words: selfish, senseless, shameless, sensual; selfish, senseless,
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.900]   shameless, sensual.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:04.260]   Now this is how ungodly people act, because this is how they think.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.960]   It's a matter of the mind.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.360]   You notice in verse 17, "futility of mind."
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.920]   You notice in verse 18, "darkened in their understanding."
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.960]   You notice the word "ignorance."
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.420]   It's that they don't know.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.520]   First Corinthians 2:14, "The natural man understands not the things of God.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.900]   They're foolishness to him, and they're spiritually discerned, and he can't know them."
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.600]   It's always an issue of the mind.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.660]   As a man thinks in his heart, so is he.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.920]   And the thinking is corrupted.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   Maybe the most familiar treatment of that is back in Romans 1, where it says, "Professing
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.380]   to be wise."
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.560]   Men became fools.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.780]   Why?
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.140]   Because verse 21 says, "Even though they knew God, God was revealed in His creation, they
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.400]   didn't honor Him as God or give thanks.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.660]   They became futile or empty or vain in their speculations, their intellectual musings.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.840]   Their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:19.340]   Professing to be wise, they became fools, and so God gave them over to sexual immorality,
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   homosexuality.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.340]   They became foolish.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.340]   Now, this is not a reprobate mind.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.100]   It's a mind game.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:31.100]   It's about the truth coming to the mind so that there's understanding.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:38.080]   If you're a Christian, according to what we just saw in verses 20 and 21, you were reprogrammed.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.060]   You learned Christ.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:50.300]   You heard Him speak to you through His Word.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:56.280]   And you learned your lesson by the power of the Holy Spirit, and you embraced the truth
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.220]   that's in Jesus.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.460]   And that totally transformed you.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.400]   So what's wrong with everybody?
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.520]   They're selfish.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:15.500]   They want to design their own standard of morality, invent their own religion.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.260]   They want to be their own god.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260]   Secondly, Paul says they're consequential.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.060]   They're inherently senseless.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:27.540]   Verse 18: "Being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.260]   ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart."
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:38.300]   Darkened, excluded, ignorant, and hard-hearted.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.880]   This makes you into a senseless brick.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.720]   Lost in the foolishness of their own mind, they become senseless, and their senselessness
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.220]   is perpetuated.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.040]   They're blind until it becomes hardness.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.520]   Darkened in their understanding, sketao , it means to darken or blind.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:10.000]   They are blind, and in their blindness they continue down a path of blindness that is
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.420]   defined next as being excluded from the life of God, which is another way of saying they
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.180]   are dead.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.180]   They are dead.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:29.320]   They're dead and blind, estranged from God, and it takes them down a path of the hardness
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.120]   of heart.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.800]   Hardness of heart, porosos in the Greek from poros , which meant a very, very hard stone.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.380]   It was used to describe the tissue that developed when bones were fused together and became
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.380]   very hard.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.140]   It meant to be hard without feeling.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.140]   Same sun that melts the wax hardens the clay.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:56.440]   You hear the truth and resist the truth, and what should melt your heart hardens it.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:03.920]   When sin is ignored, when conscience is silenced, when guilt and conviction are not permitted,
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.400]   the heart grows harder and harder and harder.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:18.140]   Conscience becomes scarred, and we are warned in Hebrews 3 and 4, "Don't harden your heart.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.100]   Don't harden your heart.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.100]   Don't harden your heart."
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.100]   It's deadly.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.100]   It's deadly.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.640]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.340]   They're selfish and they are senseless.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.680]   Thirdly, they're shameless.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.280]   In verse 19, they become callous.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.040]   This means being past feeling.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.240]   They don't feel anything.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.920]   In fact, their callousness is so severe that Philippians 3:19 says this.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.060]   This is a stunning statement: "Their glory is in their glory."
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.140]   Their glory is in their shame.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.020]   Their glory is in their shame.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.880]   They're shameless.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   Their glory is in their shame.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.680]   They parade their shame.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.320]   What they should be ashamed of is what they parade.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.460]   This whole culture does that.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:20.020]   The internet is just full of it, people parading shame.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:29.820]   What people should be ashamed of is their glory, their claim to fame.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:36.020]   The verb here, apalgeo, means cease to feel pain.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:44.480]   Selfishness leads to senselessness, and senselessness develops into shamelessness.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.980]   Then you're into verse 19.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.380]   "They are sensual.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:23:01.260]   They having become callous, or shameless, have given themselves over to sensuality,
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:10.160]   which releases the practice of every kind of filthiness with greediness."
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.840]   They literally hand themselves over.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.920]   This is self-inflicted.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.240]   They hand themselves over, so selfish, so senseless, so shameless.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.940]   They hand themselves over.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.340]   They hand themselves over to sensuality.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.560]   The word there for sensuality is asalgea , and it means basically an unrestrained
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.600]   life.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.360]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond senselessness.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:48.340]   This is the disposition of the soul where selfishness, senselessness, and shamelessness
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.900]   reach their end.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.640]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:02.560]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.660]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:14.620]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.660]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.660]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.660]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:18.740]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:18.860]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:18.960]   It's a step beyond shame, which is a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.060]   It's a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.120]   It's a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.260]   It's a step beyond sensuality.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.720]   akatharsia", every kind of uncleanness, every kind of filthiness, and they do it with greediness.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:32.360]   They can't get enough filthiness. Greediness is pleonexia, which is the insatiable craving,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:43.540]   the uncontrolled appetite, the unsatisfied passion. This is what's wrong with everybody.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.540]   Before we were believers, it was what drove us as well. It doesn't always manifest itself
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:54.820]   in the same way. There are some restraints in some societies. Those restraints were ours
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:00.360]   for a few hundred years; they are long gone. There's some restraint offered by families
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:09.340]   and parenting, and they're gone. There's some restraints offered by education; they're gone.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:17.080]   This is a powerful picture of those who have not learned Christ. But the point is to get
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.820]   beyond that.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:29.080]   And to say this: You have not learned Christ in that way. And that takes you back to verse
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:43.900]   17. You can no longer walk like everybody else walks. You can't. You can't walk in selfishness,
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.100]   senselessness, selfishness. You can't walk in selfishness. You can't walk in selfishness.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:56.860]   You can't walk in senselessness, shamelessness, sensuality. No, not if you have been saved.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:06.300]   The separation is in verses 20 and 21. You learned Christ. You heard Him speak in His
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:15.180]   Word. You were taught the gospel in Him. You were taught the truth is in Jesus, and your
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:25.540]   salvation separates you from the rest of the world.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:37.560]   History is the story of judgment and salvation, wrath and mercy. You need to think on which
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:44.460]   side you would like to be: child of wrath, child of mercy, child of mercy. You need to
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:52.260]   think on which side you would like to be: child of mercy, son of Satan, son of God.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.600]   As I said earlier in today's message, we find ourselves living between God's judgment on
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.120]   the unrighteous and God's mercy on the righteous. Thankfully, we understand God knows exactly
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.100]   what He's doing.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.540]   To help you better understand what the Bible says about a society in turmoil, I'd like
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.500]   to recommend a book that I contributed to several years ago. It's called "The Law of the Unrighteous."
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   It's a book that I wrote about the unrighteousness of the unrighteous. It's a book that I wrote
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.420]   about the unrighteousness of the unrighteous. It's a book that I wrote about the unrighteousness
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:21.260]   years ago the title is right thinking in a world gone wrong that's a great title
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.560]   and this book addresses a wide range of topics from the economy terrorism
