[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Back on Friday, we talked about whether non-Christians can honor God or not.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.200]   That was a very helpful episode and I commend it to you as episode number 1145.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   Today's question naturally flows from it and it comes to us in the inbox in the
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.800]   form of a follow-up email from a listener named Daniel who points
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.600]   back to an even older episode.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.760]   Daniel asks this, "Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.120]   In your August 30th episode, you helpfully addressed the correlation
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.640]   between God's love and his election and the fact that the two are basically
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.400]   interchangeable, if I understood you correctly.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.280]   However, it leaves me with the question about how I am to understand
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.600]   God's love toward the non-elect.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.080]   Does God love the non-elect?
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.160]   If so, is that love a different quality or characteristic
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400]   than his love for the elect?
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.800]   And thank you, Pastor John, for helping me make sense of this difficult issue."
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.120]   Well, I'll try.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.280]   Let's remind ourselves that with all such questions, we are utterly, totally
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.760]   dependent on what God has chosen to reveal in his Word.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.560]   There is no way we can come up with answers to these kinds of questions
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.720]   without relying decisively on God's Word.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.240]   So you should test everything I say.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.760]   By the Word of God, my opinion counts for very little.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.600]   God's Word counts for everything.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.280]   So let me share with you some texts that show, I think, very clearly
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.440]   that God loves the non-elect, those whom he has not chosen
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.000]   for eternal salvation.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.520]   And then some passages to show that he has a unique kind of love for
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.040]   his own elect people, his bride.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.000]   Matthew 5, 44.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.720]   Jesus says, "I say to you, love your enemies.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   Pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.520]   Father who is in heaven.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.560]   For he, God, makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.720]   He sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.600]   Acts 14, 16.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.520]   Paul in Lystra says to the crowd, "In past generations, he allowed all
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.480]   nations to walk in their own ways.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.520]   Yet he did not leave himself without a witness, but he did good by giving you
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.920]   rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.040]   gladness." 1 Timothy 2, 3, and 4.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.120]   Pray for your leaders that's good, pleasing in God's sight, who desires all
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.840]   people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.160]   Ezekiel 33, 11.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.560]   "Say to them, 'As I live,' declares the Lord, 'I don't have pleasure in the
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.480]   death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.'"
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.800]   Turn back, turn back from your evil ways.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.280]   Why would you die, O house of Israel?
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800]   John 3, 16.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that whoever believes in
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.200]   him should not perish but have eternal life."
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.680]   So from those texts, I conclude, and many more, not just those, that there's a real
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.800]   sense in which God has extended great kindness and goodness and patience and
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.600]   invitation to the whole unbelieving world of mankind.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   As Paul puts it in Romans 2, 4, "To presume upon the riches of his kindness
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.560]   and forbearance and patience," not knowing God's kindness is leading you to
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.480]   repentance.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.000]   Now the problem arises when folks go beyond Scripture and infer from those
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.040]   statements about the love of God for all the people that he cannot and does not
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.800]   elect some to everlasting life, but not all.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.160]   In other words, they infer that since he loves all, he must love all in the same
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.000]   way, that he cannot choose to love some in a more focused, electing, redeeming,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920]   adopting, eternal way.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.440]   But it seems to me that's exactly what the Scriptures teach, that he does have a
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:50.680]   different love, an electing love, a saving love for some and not all, and that this
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.320]   is totally owing to the abundance of his grace since nobody deserves it.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.960]   I hear the text from which I get that idea, Ephesians 1, 3, following, "God has
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.840]   blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.360]   he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.520]   blameless before him.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.520]   In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.120]   according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace."
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.560]   Or Ephesians 5, 25, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.120]   himself up for her, a unique wife love.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   I have a special love for my wife, but I hope I love all women appropriately."
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:56.880]   Romans 1, 7, "To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.040]   grace to you."
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.880]   Jude 1, "Jude, a servant of Jesus, brother of James, to those who are called,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.720]   beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus."
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   Romans 9, 25, "As indeed he says in Hosea, 'Those who were not my people, I will
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.360]   call my people.'
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.720]   And her who was not beloved, I will call beloved.'"
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.440]   So there's a sense in which those who are not loved in this way were not loved.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.800]   And Romans 8, 28, "We know that those who love God, all things work together for
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.040]   their good."
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.880]   That's a kind of love.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.640]   God is working all things together for their good.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.320]   In John 17, 9, Jesus is praying.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   He says, "I'm not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me out
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.960]   of the world, for they are yours."
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.400]   So there's a unique praying love that he performs for them and not for others.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.280]   Or John 10, 14, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.160]   I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.000]   And I lay down my life for the sheep."
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.520]   Or 1 Timothy 4, 10, "To this end, we toil and strive because we have our hopes set on
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:28.080]   the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe."
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.120]   So there's a sense in which his saving grace is extended to all, but there is a
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.760]   special application of it effectively to those whom he draws into faith.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.720]   So my answer to Daniel's question is that God's love for the non-elect consists in
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.400]   genuine acts of kindness and generosity and patience and invitation.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.760]   And just think about it.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.960]   When you're talking to an unbeliever, we are able to point out to unbelievers
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:10.200]   evidences on every hand of God's kindness to them, not the least of which is that we
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.960]   and they should at this moment be suffering in hell, and we're not.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.760]   Nevertheless, every believer knows that we did not save ourselves.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.640]   Our faith is not because we're smarter or better or wiser or less fallen than
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.080]   those who do not believe.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.760]   We know that grace alone, not merit, has opened our eyes and caused us to see the
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.240]   supreme value and beauty of Christ.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   And therefore, we know that we have been loved with an everlasting love, a dying
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:53.520]   love, a love Paul calls it a great love in Ephesians 2, 5, that raises us from the
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:01.000]   dead, an electing love, a regenerating love, a preserving love that we will be
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   loved with forever, a divine, glorifying love.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.280]   And we know that we have merited none of this.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:21.360]   It is totally free, and therefore, we should be utterly and eternally thankful.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:30.320]   And while we have breath, we should be bent on bringing as many people as we can
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.880]   into this amazing grace, even if it costs us our lives, because that's what it costs
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.800]   Jesus to bring us in.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.760]   Amazing, unmerited grace indeed.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, for explaining the generosity of God to the non-elect.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.480]   And thank you for listening and making this podcast a part of your week in Commute.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.760]   Well, it is not easy to apply all of the New Testament to our lives, but it's
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   certainly easier than trying to apply the Old Testament to all of our lives.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.520]   So what role does the Old Testament play in our Christian lives?
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.320]   That's the question next up on Wednesday.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
