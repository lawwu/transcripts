[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   So today I want to talk about a quiet revolt against social media that seems to be circulating
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.600]   mainly among artists.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.040]   It's being documented and broadcast on YouTube.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.920]   What I'm going to do is I'll get into the theory behind this revolt.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.300]   I'm going to argue why it might be more sustainable than you might at first imagine and then help
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.880]   you understand if you should be joining this revolt as well, even if you're not specifically
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   an artist.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.600]   But let's start by trying to understand what's going on.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   I want to look at some videos.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.200]   I'm going to load these on the screen.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.960]   I'll turn off the audio and have the closed captioning on, but I'll load some videos that
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960]   are emblematic of this ongoing revolt.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.520]   So I'm putting a video on here now.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   This is from Damon Dominique, which is really like a travel video channel.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.120]   But this video seems to be one of the sparks for the current revolt.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.480]   I do got to say first, by the way, Damon has beautiful aesthetics on his video.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.040]   I don't know if you see this, Jesse, but it's a very expensive camera and he has a, I would
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.920]   say like a vintage Vogue sort of visual aesthetic happening with the light, the color balance
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   or whatever.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   Anyway, it's very nice looking channel.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.560]   Let me put on his closed captioning because what he's talking about, what this video is
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.680]   called is "Why am I not posting anymore?"
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.740]   And basically he is arguing he is tired of having to post on social media.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.960]   He's tired of trying to get his content viral on social media.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.520]   I appreciate the giant glass of wine he's pouring right now.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.000]   This is a gag where he's kind of emphasizing his frustration with what's going on in social
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   media.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300]   And he catalogs, it's an hour long video.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.480]   He catalogs all these frustrations with the interaction of his content, which is very
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.740]   artistic as you can tell by how it looks, and the demands of social media.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.960]   This seemed to inspire a lot of other people, more specifically artists to post their own
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   videos.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   Let me post another one here.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.260]   All right, here's one that one of the listeners sent me.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.860]   This is hi.imded_art channel.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860]   This is a smaller channel.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.020]   It's an artist who does really cool artwork.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.440]   And this video is called "Deleting Social Media and Making a Website."
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.380]   The artist here, who does videos of her art, which I really appreciate, is basically saying
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.580]   in this video, "I'm done with social media.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.580]   I'm creating a website.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.020]   And I can put my art on my website, and I'm going to control it, and I don't want to post
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.860]   things anymore and have to see how many likes they get or what have you.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.860]   I'm done."
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.860]   Right.
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860]   So let's see.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.140]   I'll read a little bit of what she's saying here.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.500]   It's a good presentation worth listening to.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   Let's see.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   All right.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   I don't know how to fast forward.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.380]   I got to go out of full screen here.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.940]   I want to read a little bit of what she's saying here.
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.540]   She has some interesting things, she says.
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.540]   There we go.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.540]   All right.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.540]   I'm going to expand that.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.700]   Man, you can tell I use a lot of social media, Jesse.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.620]   I don't even know how to use videos.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.220]   You notice when people unfollow, people unsubscribe, and you see that, like it's so noticeable,
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.220]   and it hurts.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.220]   It does hurt.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.320]   But at the same time, I'm like, "I would rather you know if I'm not for you, I'm not for you."
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.980]   So if you choose to unsubscribe or unfollow, it's like, "Well, I'm sad to see you go.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.540]   Maybe I'll catch you on the flip side."
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.940]   Feeling like you can never keep up, and an addictive quality, of course, that is just
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.480]   social media in general.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.660]   So she's going on about you just get really caught up in how many followers, and you really
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.540]   notice when numbers go up and down, et cetera.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.780]   Very good sort of honest video.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.760]   Here's another one I want to load up.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   This is another artist.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   This is LRNDulyOneWord.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.220]   That's the name of the channel.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.020]   This website is, "I deleted all social media and made a website."
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.020]   All right.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.780]   So in this video, this artist is explaining why.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.080]   So she left social media.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.520]   She has these outlines.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.880]   She also was tired of the demands of social media, and she built a website.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.660]   And that's where she's putting her art now.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.180]   All right.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.140]   There's a lot more videos like this happening on the internet right now of people declaring,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.660]   especially artists, "I'm leaving social media, and I'm just going to put stuff on a website
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.440]   that I control."
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   So what are their reasons?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.720]   Well, I mean, I actually went through and watched these videos so I could summarize
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.120]   like the main reasons given by these artists, and let me give you the three main categories.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.300]   Number one, they're leaving because social media is controlling and reducing the possibilities
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.720]   and quality of their art.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.160]   They talk about the limited format.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.600]   "Oh, if I'm posting on Instagram, then my art now has to somehow fit into the physical
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.180]   format that's appropriate for Instagram."
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:01.640]   They talk about the algorithm that you are posting for rewards sameness and not uniqueness.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.900]   This is a big point that Damon in particular has, is that social media used to reward people
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.340]   for doing something different.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.460]   Now it really forces conformity, otherwise the algorithm will ignore you.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.560]   It focuses on what's already working.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.780]   Another big reason is these artists are saying social media is making them unhappy.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.420]   They have to use it all the time.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.620]   They don't like being addicted.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.100]   They also don't like feeling as if they're trying to get other people addicted as well,
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.540]   that they're playing this game of trying to make their stuff as compelling as possible
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.600]   so people can't look away.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.260]   The third reason they give is it seems to deny the reasons why they became artists in
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.360]   the first place.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.980]   So I think in particular, the LR and Julie video had a really good take on this, where
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.980]   she was saying, "Look, we didn't get into art for social validation.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.360]   That's not why artists become artists, is to have social validation.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.340]   They do it to create something new, to take raw materials and produce, on the other hand,
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.340]   something that's beautiful or engaging.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.340]   Art, the production of art, is what they got into art for, but having to integrate their
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.700]   art in social media meant that their focus became more on social validation, trying to
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.220]   build or appease crowds of people.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.620]   So that's why they're leaving social media.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.380]   So here's the key question I want to ask about this revolt.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.340]   Is it narrow?
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.780]   Is what these artists doing essentially self-sacrifice?
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.220]   They're going to destroy their career because they're not on social media, but they're doing
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.140]   so to make a broader point, and maybe that's important.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:44.620]   Or is this different engagement with the internet, to be a creative and to be engaging the internet
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.180]   without social media, is this actually sustainable?
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.220]   In fact, could this actually be better?
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.980]   Those are the questions I want to explore here.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.620]   Not surprisingly, I'm going to make an argument for the second, but to do that, let's get
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620]   a little bit theoretical.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.620]   All right.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.040]   So what do we have when we think about the internet?
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.540]   At the base, all we have is a standard set of protocols and a standard scheme for addressing.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.180]   This was the big innovation of the internet.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.180]   Whatever computer network you have and whatever computers you have on it, if you use the same
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.180]   protocols and you use the standard way of referring to yourself, the standard addressing
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.020]   scheme, you can plug into the internet and anyone can talk to you and you can talk to
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.820]   anyone else.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.660]   So anyone could connect to this network of networks and any two machines connected to
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.220]   this network of networks could talk back and forth with each other because we all agree
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.580]   to speak a common language, a common protocol.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.380]   We all agree to refer to ourselves with a common naming scheme.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.620]   So the fundamental problem of the internet from the very beginning is how do people find
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.980]   other people or things to talk to?
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.380]   How do you find what machine to talk to?
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.560]   How do you find what information you want to get?
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.440]   When you have this growing collection of networks and networks, anyone can connect to it.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.840]   How do you figure out what to do?
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.400]   It is a hard problem.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.720]   My younger audience probably doesn't remember this, but I remember this in the nineties
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.560]   when the web, which is a part of the internet, but when the web became a big thing, they
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.160]   would publish internet yellow pages.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.040]   Do you remember these Jesse?
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Kind of.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   Actual yellow pages, a paper book that looked like the yellow pages and you would like flip
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.400]   through to a topic and there would be like list of URLs, like here's a website, there's
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   a website.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.900]   That's actually a early Yahoo.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:35.000]   Yahoo used to be when it started in the nineties, just a hierarchical list of websites by topic.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.720]   Well, business, entertainment business under this, movie companies, and then here's a list
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.240]   of like websites and movie companies.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.040]   Google really solved the problem of finding specific information.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.000]   It said, okay, we have a better way of actually, if I want to find out about this thing, it
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   does a really good job of finding where on the internet are there authoritative sources
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.920]   on this particular thing.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   You're interested in.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.120]   So that was, that kind of solved that original problem, but we still had the problem of what
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.040]   we could call serendipitous discovery and serendipitous exposure.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.400]   This ability to say, I'm not looking for something in particular, I'm not looking for the website
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   for Warner brothers.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.360]   I want to find something that I didn't know I was looking for.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.240]   I want new ideas, new art, interesting people, new perspectives.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.220]   This is the bigger promise of the internet is not just that it's a more convenient way
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.000]   for companies to be accessible online, but that you can have this serendipitous discovery
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.120]   and the flip side, how do you service the creatives so they can produce stuff?
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.620]   And even if people don't know them directly, people can find them.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.880]   So as creatives can find audiences and audiences can find creative input.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   That became the second fundamental challenge of the internet, especially once we had the
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.540]   web 2.0 revolution.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.760]   This was happening roughly like 2004, 2005 is when this picked up where it became really
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.320]   easy to put stuff on the internet.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.640]   Hey there, I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book, slow productivity,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.160]   the lost art of accomplishment without burnout.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're really going to like
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.540]   this book.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:22.920]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step instructions for
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.080]   putting it into action.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.940]   So to find out more about the book, check out calnewport.com/slow, everything you need,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.940]   you can find there.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.940]   All right.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.940]   Thanks.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.940]   Let's get back to it.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.720]   Like the 1990s, if you wanted to put something on the internet, you had to get a server,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.880]   you had to hand code a website in HTML, it was kind of difficult.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.800]   By 2004, 2005, there was web-based software like blog software, for example, that made
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.940]   it easy to post information.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.520]   You could have an easy interface and like type and drag in photos and the software would
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.280]   automatically produce a nice looking webpage for you.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.640]   That was the web 2.0 revolution.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.520]   So now really like anyone could post stuff, it was much easier.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   The barrier to entry was lower.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.280]   And we had this question of serendipitous creative discovery, how is that going to happen?
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   All right.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.320]   The model that came to dominate is what we can call the algorithmic model.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.160]   I'll draw this on the screen here.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.640]   I'm putting a lot of dots on the screen.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.660]   These are people creating stuff, their own individual stuff.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:32.660]   So in the algorithm model, we have a single platform.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.940]   So I'll draw a big gray box here.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.140]   And inside this platform is going to be algorithms.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.820]   So I'll put a bunch of little binary symbols here.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.240]   Right.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.200]   They have algorithms.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.700]   Everyone is going to aim the stuff they're creating at the central platform.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.120]   So we're all aiming what we're creating at the central platform that's running lots of
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   algorithms.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.840]   And then on this other side, we'll have a single, this will be us, this will represent
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   us.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.960]   I can put a dot for someone who's just trying to consume some information.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.400]   So I'll put that over here.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:24.440]   And the platform, it's going to decide like, okay, here's what, here's something cool for
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   you to see.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.200]   I'll make a stream of things for you to see.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   All right.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.280]   So this is the algorithmic model I've drawn.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.760]   Lots of creators.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.520]   Everything goes into a box.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.560]   That box then looks at it and decides for you, yeah, here's stuff you might like.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.160]   And it chooses stuff that you might like.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   All right.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.880]   So that's basically what it is today.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.040]   If you're using TikTok or using Instagram or you're using Twitter slash X, this is how
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.380]   your content, how you're finding serendipitously.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.800]   So content you didn't know existed, how you're finding stuff you didn't know existed that
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.960]   might be interesting to you.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.120]   And if you're a creative, so you're over here on the other side, you're just throwing your
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.640]   stuff in here, hoping that your stuff is assigned to people, right?
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.800]   And this is what's creating the problems that the artists are talking about is now your
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.440]   art becomes about satisfying this gray box.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.240]   Try and do whatever you can do to get it to select yours, to show to other people.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.920]   And this of course has a real constricting effect.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.360]   There are advantages to this model though.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.220]   The reason why this model is so popular is there's real advantages.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.680]   First of all, is it simplicity.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.240]   If I'm a consumer, it's really easy.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.400]   I have a stream on an app on my phone that's being populated by an algorithm.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.960]   If I want to serendipitously encounter information, I press an icon on my phone and there we go.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.360]   And it's just, I'm just being shown stuff that's been selected for me.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.520]   That might be interesting for the creators who are feeding this algorithm.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.920]   There's a sort of lottery ticket excitement to it.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.120]   You never know your thing, right?
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.680]   And I'll, I'll highlight something over here.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.640]   Your thing might be really favored and you have a way if you could reach thousands of
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.480]   people all at once, like there's that lottery ticket excitement of virality.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.920]   If you just never know you could be like one right choice of topic and look and timing
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.020]   away from being seen by, by, by an amount of people that would have in a traditional
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.860]   world require like a whole career of building up your success.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:28.160]   There's also a huge aspect of attention manipulation here that affects creators.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.000]   We don't talk about that that much anymore, but I talk about it in my 2016 book, deep
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.840]   work.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.360]   One of the ways that when these algorithmic platforms took off, one of the ways that they
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:45.800]   convince people to move their creative activities over to these platforms is they collectivized
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   attention.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.680]   And what I mean by that is that in a pre algorithmic platform web 2.0 world, one of the big problems
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.840]   if you were creating content is that it was very hard to get people to find the look at
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.040]   what you, what you produced, right?
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.660]   It's hard.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.000]   And so you would, you would write a blog or post some photos on your Flickr account or
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   on your Tumblr.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.720]   They're like, no one would show up, right?
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.480]   And this is, you know, uh, this is hard.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.380]   You're like, I, I look, I want people to show up.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.100]   What these original platforms like Facebook offered is we'll make it seem like people
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.740]   are showing up.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.560]   It collectivizes attention.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.480]   These platforms make it easy for you to have something like a couple thousand of, I'm putting
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.940]   an air quotes here, followers.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.060]   Now in reality, these are castles made in sand.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.160]   This is not a couple thousand people who are waiting for what you're going to produce next.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.840]   I mean, most of them are not seeing, really aren't seeing what you're producing anyways.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.960]   The follow was a button.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.600]   They clicked at some point and forgot about it and the algorithms aren't even serving
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.880]   your content to them.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.240]   But for you, the creator, you get this simulacrum of like, I'm in an arena, there's a few thousand
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   people.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.520]   They really care what I'm doing.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.080]   That feels really good.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.000]   And that was really powerful for content creators.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.720]   This idea of we're going to give you a sense that you have an audience and not like a dozen
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.480]   people, but like hundreds or a couple thousand people.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.080]   And this was very powerful.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.560]   So it was playing on the psychological needs.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.880]   Again, it's not really a couple thousand people who are watching what you're doing, but they
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.160]   could give you that sense.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.520]   And that really attracted a lot of people, not even creatives, just everyday people who
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.080]   messed around with a GeoCities website or a Tumblr.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.360]   They all moved over to Facebook because Facebook had this model where you will comment on what
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   your friends are doing.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.200]   You will comment on what you were doing, whether or not it's good or interesting.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.640]   This is going to happen.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.880]   And you get the sense of like, people care about what I'm doing, which is incredibly,
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   incredibly powerful.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.640]   So the algorithm model has some real attractions.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.520]   So what happens when you quit this?
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.240]   Well, we get to what we can call the distributed trust model.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.640]   So now what I'm drawing is a bunch of these blue creator dots again, but now there's no
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.600]   gray box that everyone is connecting into what you what you get in the distributed trust
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.480]   model where now where are people producing and let me let me just label this like they're
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   producing.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.540]   These are ugly dots, by the way, Jesse.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:21.840]   So now we could think of like email newsletters, podcasts, websites, all independent content,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.200]   stuff that's not going into a centralized platform that everyone's on, but everyone's
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.640]   kind of posting their own things.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.480]   And it's all universally accessible over the Internet, but it's not being curated by algorithms.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.080]   And what we get in this world is these like individual links of trust.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   Right.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.840]   And a lot of times they're kind of we see these little cliques of people that all know
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.560]   each other and they all talk to each other.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.880]   So think about these orange lines.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:54.640]   I'm drawing these orange lines are think of these as like connections, like people that
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   know each other.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.880]   It's an actual human trust relationship.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   I'm a person.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.880]   You're a person.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   We have some sort of connection.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.160]   We communicate with each other and you get this web of these connections.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.440]   And as you can see on here, if you're if you're watching this online, there's clusters like
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.680]   a bunch of people that know each other.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.040]   Over here is a bunch of people that know each other.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.760]   And so like they all know each other and then you have these like longer distance links
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   connecting them.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.840]   It's like standard human social networking happening on the Internet.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.680]   Though, how does information move through here?
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.880]   It moves over these links.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   It moves over these links.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.560]   So I'm going to let's trace a particular piece of information, you know, maybe someone over
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.320]   here produces something.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.000]   And they send it to like their nearby people.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   They have like interest.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   They like it.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.240]   It spreads to this local group.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.840]   Now it's going to maybe make its way out of here because this person has some connection
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   to that person.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.040]   It kind of makes its way out of there and maybe makes its way into infecting another
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.560]   clique and the information begins to spread.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.080]   Now, it's not all epidemic viral spread.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.560]   Some of this stuff just goes, you know, a little distance like over here.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.200]   Hey, it kind of spreads in here, makes its way out and stops and some stuff goes farther
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.160]   and some stuff has a more sort of serendipitous path where it just kind of makes its way,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.360]   you know, off random links and gets to a pretty far distance in the graph.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.040]   But the information is being spread on individual trust-based links between people that have
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.040]   some sort of established relation, be it digital or physical.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.920]   This turns out to be an actually very good way of curating serendipitously interesting
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.880]   information.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:39.080]   In fact, the curation decisions that end up being made here implicitly tend to be much
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   more interesting and higher quality than what you would get with a centralized algorithm.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.760]   Because now the main incentive is if I'm going to send you something, I really care about
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.280]   what I'm sending you.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.400]   I'm not going to send you nonsense.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.680]   I'm not going to send you something that's not interesting.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.520]   I'm not going to send you something where the person is clearly unhinged or it's really
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.120]   hateful, most likely, you know, unless one of these clusters is like a cluster of Nazis
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.880]   or something like that.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.800]   It works out to be really good curation.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.040]   And so when something makes its way through this network and me as a receiver receives
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.880]   it, it's interesting stuff I'm receiving.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.360]   It's carefully curated stuff, like a really original idea that looks like nothing else
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.040]   but has a spark of something interesting.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.120]   It's going to spread probably pretty well.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.720]   And I'm not going to get all these things, but I'm going to get an interesting mix of
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   these things.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   And maybe I'm primarily getting things that are local in this graph from places that aren't
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.120]   too far away.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   But that's OK.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   I'm getting an interesting mix of things.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.320]   And then occasionally long distance things make it into this region of the network graph.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.920]   And then that spreads to me as well.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.000]   From the point of view of any individual receiver here, you're going to end up getting a really
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.320]   interesting serendipitous mix of information that's going to be much more original and
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.440]   diverse and I would say creative than what you're going to get when we trust TikTok's
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.480]   algorithms or Instagram's algorithm to decide for us.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.800]   It's also we're going to have community standards can implicitly be enforced.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.500]   So instead of trying to figure out, for example, what are the rules for this billion person
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.840]   social network about what's acceptable and what's not acceptable, what you get in a distributed
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.600]   trust model is like, well, over here we have shared standards implicitly because we know
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.260]   each other and we have similar interests.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.880]   So when stuff comes in here that we don't like, we don't like that tone, we think that
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.800]   is over the top or conspiratorial, whatever it is, it's just not going to spread in our
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   group.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.840]   And so you're getting implicitly these regionalized community standard type spread.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.120]   Anyways, it's a really interesting way to have serendipitous information spread.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.800]   It's a really interesting way if you're a creator to have your information spread.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   Now there's one more twist here.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.320]   So if you're a creator, your information is spreading somewhat serendipitously through
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.480]   these networks because of individual trust connections.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.600]   But what happens is, is as your information, it's like, let's look at this, this orange
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.960]   if you're watching this like orange path here.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:07.120]   As this creator's information sort of begins to spread, you begin to attract new direct
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.580]   connections.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.160]   So now more and more of these people might say, oh, well, I kind of want to connect with
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   you.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   I like this too.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.480]   I want to connect with you as well.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   I like this too.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.840]   I want to connect with this as well.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.800]   And you begin to build around you this cluster of this clique, this cluster of shared connections
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.120]   of people that you can more directly communicate your information to.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.320]   This is really the standard of the original vision for the internet.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.520]   It's a vision of these distributed connections.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.600]   We're all speaking the same language.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.160]   The curation decisions are human.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.200]   Do I want me to send you or two people something?
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.640]   Did I like this thing that came to me?
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   I did.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.240]   I'm now going to connect directly to this person.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.520]   I'm going to subscribe to their letter or listen to their podcast or their RSS feed
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.400]   or go to their website.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.280]   And you can, as a receiver of information, receive a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.000]   And as a producer of information, begin to grow as your content and art warrants it,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.320]   a sort of larger sort of clique.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   It's a really good system.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.720]   And it solves a lot of the problems that we get when we instead use this system of like,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.780]   let the gray box handle everything.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.680]   Everyone will talk to the gray box and we'll just sort of have a thousand people in Northern
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.020]   California to sit there tweaking it and try to make everyone happy.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.400]   So when these artists are leaving social media to create their own websites, they're leaving
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.040]   the algorithm model of information spread and discovery to go to the distributed trust
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.840]   model of information spread and discovery.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.900]   And I think that's not a bad model.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.960]   The biggest problem with it is it's slow, right?
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.840]   I mean, you can build your true fans as a creator, but you got to produce good stuff.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.000]   It has to like make its way on a regular basis through this network and attract people one
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.240]   at a time.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   It's slow.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.840]   There's no attention manipulation.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.520]   So if you're not really producing something original or interesting that people really
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.000]   like, there is no pretending like there's a thousand people who care what you're doing.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Like TikTok can do for you.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   You just won't succeed.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.040]   So there's this sort of threshold for success.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.640]   So it could be frustrating.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.080]   Like I want people to think I'm interesting, but what I'm doing is not and do have to deal
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.600]   with that.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.840]   And even as a consumer of information, it's more work.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.240]   You kind of have to like follow things and keep up with things and check out different
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.640]   websites and you have email newsletters that come in that you read and sometimes you don't.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.840]   There's different podcasts and you have to discover a podcast and then you have to go
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.600]   try it and listen to some episodes.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.480]   I mean, it's a lot more work than just having a continuous stream that you just hit a button
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.940]   and there's stuff there that's really interesting.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.880]   This way of consuming content is not good for in the moment distraction.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.200]   You're trying to hide from something difficult in your life.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.840]   TikTok is there to hold your hand.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.340]   We can right away distract you whenever you need it.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.320]   This distributed trust model, no, it's harder.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.000]   Like you have to wait for the email newsletter, the new podcast to come out or for someone
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   to update their website.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.400]   It doesn't offer you a solution to the problem of numb me right now, but I think you get
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   better information.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.720]   I think it's more interesting.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   I think it's more human.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.000]   I think it solves a lot of problems of the algorithmic model.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.420]   And if you're an artist, I think it's just more true to art.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.880]   So should other people do this as well?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.000]   I think it's completely on the table.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.180]   All it takes is stop using social media, but lean into the internet as a really cool place
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.960]   and lean into it by independently produce things.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.220]   Newsletters will talk about other newsletters.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.220]   Check those out.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.960]   Podcasts will talk about other podcasts.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.420]   Check out those other podcasts, websites.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.320]   The sounds old fashioned have a folder of bookmarks.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.120]   I like this artist website.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.960]   Like I, one of the things I do, like I used to do in 2006 is like, go check out what these
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.040]   artists are up to.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:26:00.020]   Have an RSS reader if they're syndicating their content, embrace the friction, embrace
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.780]   the quirky weirdness of, I'm not just getting these really polished streams.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.540]   I think it's a, it's a cool version of the internet, but the key thing is for these artists,
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.820]   it is a version of the internet that is compatible with being a working artist.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:17.020]   I would even wager that you have a better chance of making a full-time middle-class
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:22.500]   creative living as an artist in the distributed trust model than you do in the algorithmic
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500]   model.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.620]   The algorithmic model gives you more hope, but again, these are castles in the sand.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:32.780]   All these followers that you're trying to pursue aren't really doing much for you other
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.260]   than making you feel better.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:40.020]   Whereas the carefully built distributed trust model, true fans, they'll join the subscription.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.020]   They'll buy the artwork.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.820]   They'll come to see you in person.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.020]   You only need so many of those to actually make a living.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.260]   So I'm a big believer in distributed trust model.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.600]   And I think these artists who are revolting against social media, aren't just making a
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.260]   sacrifice to prove a point.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.200]   They're discovering a better way to be a creative in an online world.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.620]   I like the castles in the sand metaphor.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.820]   Yeah, we don't, it's interesting.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.860]   That was when I first started talking about social media, that attention manipulation
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:14.540]   was the number one point because they weren't really, they had not yet fully invested in
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.140]   the engagement strategy, right?
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.940]   So like early Facebook, when I first started writing about this, they were just trying
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.620]   to get as many users as possible.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.240]   They did not care about active user minutes, like trying to make it addictive.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.780]   They wanted to make it something that you wanted to join and they didn't really care
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.380]   how much you used it after you joined it.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:38.440]   So the really, the big push of Facebook in 2004, 2005, 2006 was people are paying attention
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.440]   to you.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.260]   It was entirely attention manipulation.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.900]   Then once they went to their mobile strategy in the 2010s, then the game changed and it
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.580]   was, okay, we also need people to look at this all the time.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.140]   And so the focus became on how do we keep you on the app once you're on the app?
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:56.520]   And it became a little bit less for the average user, became a little bit less about, I want
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.180]   to be seen and more about, I want to be numbed.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   And that's what we talk about most now.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.580]   When we critique social media, we talk most about the engineered addiction, but we shouldn't
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:11.100]   forget, especially when thinking about creatives, that this like original attraction was no
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.620]   one's coming to your blogger.com blog.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.900]   But if you come over to Facebook, people will comment on your wall.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.780]   And that was really, really compelling.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:27.460]   And I think that's how they, they got people to leave the quirky, interesting old school
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.700]   distributed trust web and come into these walled gardens.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.900]   That's how they got them to do it.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.820]   That was what they were dangling.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.900]   And I think that that point's often forgotten, but artists know it well because man, it feels
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.900]   good.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:43.380]   If you create things for a living to make it seem like there's a lot of people who are
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.820]   caring about what you create.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:50.260]   And it's just weird, collectivized attention and algorithmic manipulation and they're subscribed.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.260]   What does that mean?
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.260]   Who are these followers?
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.700]   Do they ever actually see what you're doing?
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   Like who knows why they hit that button at some point and they haven't thought about
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.700]   you since.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.700]   It's a weird game that's being played on there.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.820]   Interesting as well, because these creatives probably have some sort of validation through
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.220]   their friend group on Facebook that they're like, Hey, I saw you do X, Y, Z yesterday
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.220]   on Facebook.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.180]   So then they're like, Oh, people must be honest.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.300]   So I must have those a thousand fans or whatever.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.500]   You get the, you get the signals that keep you hooked.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.020]   Hey, I really, a comments do the same thing.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.020]   Hey, this is great.
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.340]   I really love that.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.340]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.180]   But I love the way they're talking about it.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.500]   This is a Jaron Lanier point, but I'm glad it's being picked up now by these artists.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.300]   The, the impact on your art of the medium.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.900]   That was another really cool point about this is like when you're designing for Instagram,
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   part of it is just a format of Instagram really constrains what your art is.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.220]   And then you have that second order effect of you're trying to create art that Instagram
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.180]   will like, you're trying to please the algorithm.
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.740]   Art can't survive in that world.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.300]   It would be the equivalent if we, I guess we kind of did have this in the early Renaissance.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:01.020]   I think about like there was a small number of great patrons and the artists, if you wanted
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:06.100]   to succeed, if you're in Florence in the 1500s, you needed one of these great patrons to support
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.100]   you.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.580]   So those patrons you're, all you were doing was trying to design what they were going
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.580]   to like.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.940]   I mean like the Medici's taste completely shaped high Renaissance art because they were
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.100]   funding Michelangelo.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.820]   They were put, they were, and you were creating this art, you know, for them.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820]   Right.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.820]   Um, and then think about what happens.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.780]   You go to like the, the first half of the 20th century where you have the, the, the
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.340]   New York city modernism scene.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:34.660]   And what you got instead was these networks of independent galleries and people began
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.340]   to produce really experimental, interesting things.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.100]   They were, weren't serving like a small number of patrons or like, okay, we need to paint
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.620]   whatever the, the epic art is of the day.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.940]   And, and, and, you know, this is where you start to get the interesting things.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.260]   It's where you get the, the Pollux and the de Kooning's and you begin to get the, the
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.060]   abstract expressionism reaches its full, um, flourishing, right.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.300]   When you, when you get this, uh, things are more distributed and you're pretty small groups
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.900]   of people producing for an independent production, like small galleries and people are hearing
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.500]   about stuff through other people.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.980]   And that's where all the excitement happens.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.640]   That's when the innovation happens.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   So we'll see.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.300]   I saw recently that Jonathan Haidt was on Rogan as well.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.780]   I have to check that out.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:27.380]   John, do I know, uh, one up to our number two debut on New York times bestseller.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.420]   You got number one.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.540]   What's his book?
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.540]   The Anxious Generation.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.980]   Oh, he's probably on the, on his book.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.980]   So there's this new book out.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.100]   So, I mean, we talked about John all the time on the show, but his book that lays out what
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.740]   he's been talking about for the last six years, the research on teenagers and social media
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:47.380]   and phones, his book with all that research just came out and it's cool.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.660]   It's like really, um, really crushing it because it's, it's one of those things where everyone's
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.660]   like, yeah, we're there.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.940]   Just give us the, give us the numbers.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.940]   So I think that's, um, he's killing it and good for him.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.380]   It's been, there's a cool man also being attacked.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.020]   I mean, it's hard to be number one in anything.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.940]   There's like a really interesting, if you want to hear an interesting height interview,
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.540]   he went on Tyler Cowen's podcast, right?
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.860]   Marginal revolution and Tyler who I've met, and I really liked Tyler as well.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.860]   Brilliant guy.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.980]   Economist at George Mason.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.540]   Um, he's very, he's very pro technology.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.660]   Also very pro, uh, like there's different ways of thinking about technology.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.940]   My philosophy is different than his.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.260]   His is very much like we will adapt to new technologies.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:38.500]   It's, it's, uh, it's, it could be, um, disruptive when they emerge, but we adapt to them.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.060]   And ultimately over time, we can't deny that like technological innovation pushes forward
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.020]   the human story, um, and like really positive ways.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.720]   So you have to just deal with the, the tumult in the small scale.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.000]   And so he had hide on and it's really contentious interview.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   It's interesting.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Now after the fact, here's what I love about it.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.300]   After the fact, both Tyler and John were like, yeah, this got kind of contentious, but that's
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.100]   a great, like we respect each other.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.500]   And it was like a heated discussion.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   It's not gotcha.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.460]   It's not like someone hating the other person.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.900]   This is what heated debate should be like.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.900]   So that was kind of cool.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.440]   I haven't listened to it yet, but like they, uh, I guess Cowen's much more of like a libertarian
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.820]   on these issues and really pushing hide.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.860]   And, and then there's like, anyways, I've heard it's really interesting and contentious
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.740]   and a mop, but a model of what like a contentious conversation should be like when it's done
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.980]   in good faith and with respect for each other.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980]   Um, yeah.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.980]   So we should check that out.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.980]   I would say we should have John on, but he's just like in the stratosphere right now.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.180]   He doesn't need to be coming on our show.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:39.500]   He's a, he's on like every major show, which I love because God, his message is needed.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   All right.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.860]   We got questions coming up, but let's, uh, first hear from a sponsor.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.420]   So I want to talk about our friends at Maui Newey venison.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:55.580]   So that's Maui M-A-U-I Newey N-U-I.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.100]   It's a mission based food company.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:03.020]   That's bringing the healthiest red meat on the planet directly to your door.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.760]   I love this meat.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.380]   We had the jerky and we had the steaks, which we grilled.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.380]   Both were fantastic.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.780]   My kids loved the steaks, which they don't always do.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.780]   So that's a good sign.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.740]   Um, but here's the thing about this company.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.740]   What is this meat?
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.740]   Where did it come from?
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.700]   Here's their, their big idea.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:23.340]   There's an invasive deer species in Maui, the Island of Maui in Hawaii.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.420]   That's eating all the vegetation.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:31.540]   So they have to call these herds and Maui Newey his whole idea was instead of just wasting
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.700]   all of these deer, just calling them off.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.500]   We should harvest the meat because it's incredibly nutritious because they're eating a Hawaiian
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.600]   salad bar all day, very nutritious meat.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.180]   And so they figured out how they could harvest the meat from the invasive species.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:52.820]   They have to call anyways and make it available as super nutritious meat for consumers to
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.820]   actually eat.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.380]   So it's a hundred percent wild harvested red meat.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:00.220]   The only U S company that has wild harvested red meat, you can wild harvest fish.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.280]   It's the only company that's wild harvesting red meat.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.980]   So this is their invasive access to your population.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.160]   It tastes fantastic.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.300]   It's very nutritious and it's ecologically sound.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.260]   It's a, it's a species they have to cut back on anyways.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.500]   And so Maui Newey venison is definitely a favorite now in the Newport household.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.180]   So the good news is you can get 20% off your first order.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:36.700]   If you go to Maui Newey venison.com/deep questions, so that's M A U I N U I venison.com/deepquestions
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:41.820]   or use the discount code deep questions at checkout that's Maui Newey venison, the healthiest
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.360]   red meat on the planet delivered directly to your door.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:52.020]   Also want to talk about our friends at element L M N T.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.220]   So this is a what do you call it?
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:01.660]   A drink mix, like a powder you add to water that adds to the water, the electrolytes,
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.220]   including sodium that you need, especially if you've been sweating a lot or otherwise
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.760]   have been exerting yourself.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:15.740]   It's created by the former research biochemist, Rob Wolf and keto gains founder, Louis Villacenor.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.780]   It has enough sodium, potassium and magnesium to move the needle that gets you feeling to
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.780]   performing your best.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:26.860]   But what I like about it is zero sugar, zero artificial colors, no dodgy ingredients.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   I use it after I exercise.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.780]   If I've been sweating a lot, I'll put a little bit of element into my water to get back some
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.540]   of the electrolytes and not just the water.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.580]   If I've been lecturing all day or giving talks all day, I also lose a lot of liquids.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.980]   I'll put a little element in my water.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.620]   I like having that hit of salt and other things in it.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.620]   And I liked it.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   There's nothing bad.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.620]   There's no sugar.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.660]   It's not the sweet.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.660]   I can just throw it in there.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.660]   It tastes great.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.660]   I know I'm not drinking.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   Um, no, I'm not drinking stuff.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   That's not good for me.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:00.440]   You have a lot of different flavors like citrus salt, which I really like, or raspberry salt.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.540]   You also have spicy flavors like mango chili or chocolate salt, which here's a key.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.860]   If you had a late night, mix that into your coffee the next morning.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.480]   That actually goes really well with the coffee.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.360]   Um, so anyways, I am a big fan of element.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.960]   So I'm going to say, suggest you go to drink element.com/deep.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:29.580]   So that's drink element.com/deep, uh, to get a sample pack with any purchase.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.500]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   Sounds good.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.380]   Before I read the first question, I think you got to tell the audience about how you're
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.940]   wearing a new shirt.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   I'm trying a different shirt.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.780]   It's similar to my old shirt, but not quite the same.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.300]   I don't even recognize who you are anymore.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:50.660]   I don't know if it's going to perform as well, uh, but I'm, I'm, I'm sampling different options
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.660]   I have for shirts.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.320]   I mean, it does feel weird.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.500]   It's like driving your car left-handed or something.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   We'll see.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   But I'm sure it's been distracting.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   Everyone who's watching it.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   Like that's a different shade of blue.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   All right.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.700]   Our first question is from mate boots.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.500]   I'm a student and devoted myself to deep work and digital minimalism.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   Thanks to this, I've become more aware and I'm doing much better in school.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.140]   However, yesterday I was sick and it absolutely interrupted my core of a deep life.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.460]   I was on my screen all day.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.380]   Reflection made me think that my life was simply a routine loop of habits related to
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.140]   the same goals every day.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:28.260]   For example, learn to constantly develop, read a book to become smarter and wiser.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.580]   Is this extreme routine good?
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:36.620]   Um, look, it's, it's not only fine, but it is good to have regular routines or rituals
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:41.660]   that emphasize the stuff that you find important because that signals to yourself that I find
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.660]   these things important.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.660]   So of course we've talked about that.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.180]   I like reading on a regular basis.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:50.840]   It signals to your mind that you take the slow consumption of big ideas seriously, right?
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.100]   So routines to emphasize what's important is important.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:59.100]   However, I think what you're seeing here is that you probably have these turned up.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.940]   The dial of their intensity and frequency is probably turned up too much.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   This is easy to do, especially if you have a lot of discretionary time, like you're a
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.100]   student and you really have a lot of autonomy in your time.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.500]   It is easy for you to begin to really just fill your day almost entirely with these highly
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.220]   structured activities.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.740]   Then it becomes counterproductive.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.340]   So you want regular, uh, we call them daily discipline sometimes on the show.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.700]   Those are fine, but they shouldn't be all consuming of your day.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.140]   Something you do on a semi-regular basis, the signal something is important to you,
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:38.860]   but your day should not become a sort of monastic ritual of this service followed by this discipline
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.060]   followed by that service that I think not only is non-sustainable, but sort of misses
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.400]   the point of life in the first place.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.560]   Your day should be varied and exciting, suffused with gratitude and adventure, and they won't
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.440]   be that after all routine.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.680]   Also, you should have more of these sick days.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.960]   I'm doing a lot of air quotes today, Jesse, but I'm doing air quotes again.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:02.120]   You should have more of these sick days, even when you're not sick, days where you're not
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.600]   doing a normal routine.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.000]   I'm going on a long hike and then I'm watching a movie and then I'm like hanging out with
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   friends.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Right?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.840]   So you want, you want, you want the daily disciplines routines to be regular and important
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.200]   to you, but not everything you're doing.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.920]   And you can walk away with them for a while and be fine, and then come back to them and
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.560]   you can take days off and you want that sort of variety.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.320]   So it's not like you're doing something bad here.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.720]   I think you just, again, have that dial of intensity and frequency on these daily disciplines
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.660]   probably just turned up a little bit.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.600]   So turn it down a little bit and go throw a little bit more variety into your life and
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   I think you'll be fine.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.080]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.720]   Next question's from Ed.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.160]   In your books, you talk a lot about quitting social media.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.640]   I don't have Facebook, Instagram, or Tik Tok, but I do use LinkedIn.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:49.680]   However, this platform has become very toxic and I find the whole promotion aspect untasty.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   I'm considering quitting LinkedIn, but I'm unsure of its implications.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.260]   My work does not really rely on it.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.260]   What should I do?
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.600]   You can go ahead and quit it.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.040]   You know, this is classic digital minimalism.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.760]   Tools have to earn their way into your limited time and attention.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:11.140]   They use Thoreau terms because Thoreau is a real inspiration for digital minimalism.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:18.000]   Before you're willing to allocate some of your limited life force to a particular activity,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.200]   it has to earn it.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.600]   So it sounds like LinkedIn is not earning it for you.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.480]   Now if it is, like, oh, there's something that happens on LinkedIn that I find to be
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:30.400]   really important, then you can reconsider, is there a way to isolate that and get rid
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.880]   of the other aspects of this or is it worth taking that hit or is there another way to
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.960]   get a similar value?
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.680]   You can go down that whole process of figuring out, like, what value am I getting here?
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:45.640]   But if you don't have obvious value, it's not your job to figure out how these tools
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.840]   can be useful to you.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.320]   It's the tool's job to convince you that they're unmissable, right?
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.960]   And this is something I used to write a lot more about because there's a period, especially
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.520]   during the height of tech exuberance, when the attitude of the tech companies was this
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.360]   could be important.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.960]   You don't want to miss on something important, so please go use this and figure out how this
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   might be important.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.200]   And so people would just sign up for these things and use these things because it's like,
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.760]   I don't know, it could be important as if it was their job to figure out why LinkedIn
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   was important.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.600]   It was their job to buy the first Apple Watch and figure out what am I going to do with
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   this?
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.440]   You don't need to be a beta tester, Ed.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.760]   If you don't have the definitive value from LinkedIn, just walk away.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.640]   Hey, if it's a problem, if you discover something you're missing, it will become apparent and
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.000]   then you can make another decision.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.120]   But I say it's completely fine to walk away from something that's not obviously earning
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   its keep.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.280]   I don't really know what happens on LinkedIn these days.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.360]   I never go on LinkedIn.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.760]   I mean, it was when I first started talking about social media, LinkedIn was very much
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.360]   just business networks.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:55.480]   You would just kind of declare, I know this person and here's my job title.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.840]   And the main use of LinkedIn when it first started, Reid Hoffman actually blurbed so
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.780]   good they can't ignore you back in 2012.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:09.440]   Back then, the main use of LinkedIn was two degree of connection contacts.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.000]   So like I want to talk to someone who works at Google because I'm thinking about trying
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.240]   to work at Google.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.160]   I don't know anyone who works at Google.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.560]   But if I look at the people that the people I know know, probably someone in that much
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.960]   larger group works at Google.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.720]   And that's a connection that could make sense because the person who works at Google is
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.120]   hearing from someone they know and I know that person as well.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.880]   And so that's a connection that actually makes sense.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   There's trust.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.920]   It's a full train of trust.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.280]   That was the main use of LinkedIn.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.040]   Nowadays, I think you post a lot of stuff.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.520]   I know they have a big ad network as well because I hear their ads on Ferris.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.600]   So they advertise job listings, help you find people to hire.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.800]   For the individuals, I think you more promote yourself.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.760]   It's not just I want to be on here.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.720]   It's I got to post things like sort of a blog medium type setup, I think.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.840]   I got to post things and people share it and so I think there's more sort of social networking
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   going on as well.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   All right.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.400]   Who do we got next?
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.120]   Next question is from Julius.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.320]   I've been able to wean off social media and replace those old habits with reading books,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.920]   listening to audio books and watching films.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.960]   Where do I fit in online articles?
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.280]   You always mention your articles published in the New Yorker.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.920]   I want to save those to my pocket app, but that would just add to my growing to be read
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.200]   list.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.080]   So with articles, I mean, I typically recommend you have some times when you read articles
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.540]   and it could be just regular, you know, a Sunday morning to go to a coffee shop, a Friday
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.560]   happy hour afternoon of the week, a lunch hour on Wednesday, or it could be more if
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.760]   your schedule is more flexible, a little more serendipitous, like what do I want to do today?
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.960]   I want to have a article reading block, but have a ritual around it.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   I go to this place to like read articles.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.560]   I like to go to the park and sit there and read articles, right?
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.920]   Have some rituals around like when you do article reading.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   Have a place you gather articles.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.720]   So some people use things like the pocket app, the grab articles they see throughout
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.900]   the week, and they can read it in a nice interface, like on a tablet.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.320]   Other people like to print things, you know, okay, I want to bring them with me somewhere.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.280]   I don't care how you do it.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.840]   During your regular article reading period, just like read the ones that seem interesting.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   You know, that's it.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.880]   And like, yeah, you're not going to read all the articles that are interesting.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.520]   You'll read some interesting articles, and that's the goal.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.920]   And maybe it's just, I do it once a week and I read three articles, or maybe I really,
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.480]   you know, I do this three or four times a week and I get through a lot of articles.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.840]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:32.020]   The activity of value here is just encountering interesting ideas from interesting people.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.060]   And doing that is interesting.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.000]   Do not have a completist mindset about this.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.800]   I have to read every interesting article.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   There's no prize you get for reading every interesting article.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.640]   And by the way, you're not.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.460]   You think you are, but there's a hundred other publications of cool things.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.840]   So your goal is not to somehow win at every interesting article I read.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.520]   It was the experience of communing with a mind that has thought a lot about something
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.000]   and given an interesting thought.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.560]   That's going to be good for me.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.840]   It's like eating a good meal or doing exercise.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.720]   I want to do that on a regular basis, but I don't have to eat all the good meals and
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.560]   I don't have to do all the exercises.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.920]   So I would just lower that.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:13.320]   I mean, the only caveat I would give there is my articles you absolutely have to read.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.920]   That is just a given.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.300]   Bad things will befall you if you don't.
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.820]   But beyond my articles, just reading some interesting stuff each week is a win.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:30.000]   What I do with like New Yorker hard copy is if it gets too stacked, I just recycle and
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   then just start fresh.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.440]   I always try to read one article right away when the hard copy New Yorker comes.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.560]   And then if I have more time, I'll read more.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.560]   All right.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   But it's weird for me.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.020]   I don't really write for the same mediums.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.020]   Reading becomes different.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:48.680]   It's like I have a hard time reading nonfiction books that are similar to my nonfiction books
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.480]   because it's sort of close to home.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.120]   And so like we have we have sort of weirder habits sometimes.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.600]   Like if you're if you're a magazine writer, you might not read a lot of other magazine
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   articles.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   All right.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   Who do we got next?
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.200]   We got our slow productivity.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.880]   Oh, slow productivity corner.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:10.320]   Let's get some theme music, Jesse.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:16.840]   So as long time listeners know, we try to have one question per week that is inspired
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.600]   by or related to my new book, Slow Productivity.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.480]   If you have not yet read Slow Productivity, but you do listen to this podcast, that's
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   a problem.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.920]   It's like the handbook for the digital knowledge work category that we tackle so much on here.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   So check that out.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.160]   Slow Productivity.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   Find out more at kellennewport.com/slow.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   All right.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   What's our question?
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.160]   Jesse?
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   This question is from Matt.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.160]   He actually emailed me over the weekend.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.120]   So I had to include it because I was curious myself.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:46.400]   I just sat down in my garden on Eastern Saturday weekend to read Slow Productivity and hardback.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.160]   I noticed the following the size perfect size for a hardback, not so big that it's hard
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.680]   to hold up the weight.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   Again, glorious.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.560]   The paper choice, such a nice weight and color.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   The font love it.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.840]   I'm not sure what it is, but I'm going to try to work it out.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.720]   The page size by this, I mean, the margins on the page, again, I like it a lot.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.400]   Were all these factors deliberate?
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:14.400]   Well, Matt, little known fact, I hand bind every copy of Slow Productivity.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:21.960]   I sit outside under a tree and I sit and I knit, whatever you do, I bind with thread
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   every page.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.800]   Now, it's not quite true.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.520]   So a lot of that is deliberate, Matt.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.720]   I will say the thing that I really went back and forth a lot with the publisher was the
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:38.520]   interior design, the font, and how the interior design looks, because I had a very specific
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520]   idea there.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.840]   This whole book has a lot of very specific aesthetic choices.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:48.440]   I think that the first design they put together was what I would call like the standard sort
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.560]   of business space idea book design, similar maybe to like A World Without Email.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:59.520]   And it was much more of a sans-serif adjacent font, a more modern look, a more sleek kind
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.280]   of digital type look.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.000]   This was kind of like a standard look that a lot of these types of books went.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.280]   I said, no, no, no, this has to be old fashioned.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.560]   We're tapping into like this timeless attraction to slow production of things that matter.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.000]   I'm drawing from the stories of traditional knowledge workers.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.920]   I want this book to be more old fashioned.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.520]   We iterated and found that font, which you can find the name for.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.960]   It's in either the front or back of the book, you'll find the name of the font in there.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.920]   I fought for that font and the looks, this more old fashioned look.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.200]   And they were really, once they realized what I was going for, I sent them a bunch of existing
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   books.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   Like see what they did with their font and layout.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   This is what I'm looking for.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.600]   And then they got it right away.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.920]   And I really loved the way that design looked.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:47.440]   In terms of like the size and the weight, I also specifically made this book a certain
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.920]   length that lends itself to a little bit of a smaller trim size, a little bit of more
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   portability.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.720]   I didn't want, sometimes I write tomes, you know, big thick books, not super thick books,
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.720]   like a world without email.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   Like I cover a lot of ground.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.480]   That's a pretty thick book.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:05.680]   I wanted this to be more talismensic, is that a word?
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.680]   That's not how you say that.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.200]   How do you say that, Jesse?
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   I have no idea.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.200]   The vocabulary is so robust.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   Talismen.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   Sorry, talismen.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:20.760]   And then adding like a talisman, talismensic, I'm going to say.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   Like a talisman.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.140]   Like this object is capturing this new philosophy that I want to return to and like rethink
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   what I mean by productivity.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.160]   And so the size also mattered.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.080]   I was the one who really pushed the cover.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.680]   I said this cover needs to be rich and artistic.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.600]   It needs to capture a mood more than it needs to capture specific information about the
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.780]   book because there's a big psychological element to slow productivity.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.520]   So I'm glad you appreciated it, Matt, because all aspects of the aesthetics of this book
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.000]   I really cared a lot about and I took some big swings on.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.600]   You know, I did some things that were different than the sort of standard book in this space
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   for my prior books.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.320]   I'm glad you appreciated that.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.000]   Talismensic.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   There is a real word there.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   I'm just not getting it right.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   All right.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   What else have we got?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   All right.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.700]   We've got some questions from John.
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:11.020]   When I come back from a declutter, I can't find a good solution to my reading inbox.
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:16.900]   Even after the most careful filters I employ, I still get over 50 high quality think pieces
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.240]   pushed to me every week.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   Right.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   So again, so this is great.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.020]   So now we can go back and reapply our advice from before.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.280]   Collect everything interesting in a place that's easy to get to.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.480]   Have regular rituals and time set aside for reading think pieces.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.460]   Fit what you can in there.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.820]   Be happy with that.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:40.760]   Unless like your job is to stay on top of the cultural zeitgeist about a particular
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:47.380]   issue, you just want the benefit is from the interaction and grappling with the smart article,
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:50.260]   not from the collection of specific types of information.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.260]   So just like to reiterate that advice, I mean, I love the idea.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.260]   Let's elaborate this.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.100]   I love the idea of reading rituals.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.140]   Certain place, certain day, certain times you go to read.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:05.060]   Like I used to tell college students who are like seniors over 21 that my whole like Hefeweizen,
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.980]   Heidegger with Hefeweizen philosophy is like you need a, you need like a friendly pub style
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:15.300]   bar that you can bring your Heidegger, like the stuff that's sort of ambitious that you're
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.340]   reading and you can sit there and read and it doesn't feel like work.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.580]   Or this could be a spot in the woods as well.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.700]   It could be like you want interesting places you go to read and think and encounter really
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.820]   big ideas.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.180]   I used to do a lot of reading when I was at MIT during the summer and the spring on the
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:34.820]   banks of the Charles, I would like to would read on the running path or on one of the
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.700]   docks that was out there in the river, especially when like the first sunlight of the spring
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.700]   season would come.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:44.540]   I have a lot of good memories of that, like location, location really matters.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:49.000]   And so like reading wrapped around location wrapped around with non instrumentality, meaning
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.500]   you're reading just for the sake of encountering ideas, not because you're trying, you need
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.740]   it for your work or it's research for something else.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.620]   It's really, there's few human pleasures that are greater.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:06.260]   So like have a reading ritual, regularly spend time with contemporary articles, variety of
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.700]   them.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:13.380]   But the goal, the goal is going to be to fulfill that ritual, not to somehow capture everything.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.200]   And again, the big exception here is my articles.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.940]   You have to read and share those at the tombs in Georgetown at the tombs.
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.820]   That'd be a great place because cell phones.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.820]   So the tombs is a bar near Georgetown university.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.260]   It's a basement bar, college bar, cell phones don't work down there, or at least some providers
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.260]   don't work down there.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:33.900]   So you go down to the tombs, bring your book and like, you're not going to be distracted.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.700]   You can't even look at your phone.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.700]   I like the tombs.
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.700]   I was there last week.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.700]   I haven't been in a while.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.700]   We had a game at Georgetown university.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.940]   So we all went there afterwards and we won in overtime.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.940]   So it was exciting.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.940]   This was lacrosse.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.940]   And then someone, a reader reached out.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:49.940]   Someone reached out.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.940]   Oh no.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.940]   Someone else.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:52.940]   It wasn't a reader, but I was talking to someone recently.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.620]   He's friends with the new coach over there.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   Oh, okay.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.780]   So he's going to say hi to the coach.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.780]   The tombs is cool.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:00.780]   It's a rowing.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.780]   It has a rowing theme.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.780]   Love that place.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.780]   It's a Dartmouth or down there.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.780]   The tombs is cool.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   All right.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.780]   Do we have a call?
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:09.780]   We do.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   All right.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.780]   Let's see what we got.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   Hi, Kyle.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   I'm Giacomo, a product designer from Italy.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:20.020]   Thank you for Slow Productivity and for the positive change that it has brought to my
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.260]   personal and professional life.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:32.020]   I have a question for you, and it's related to the principle of obsessing over quality.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:38.680]   So the way I implement Slow Productivity is truly through the lens of quality, because
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:44.560]   as you say, obsessing over quality is the glue that brings all the different parts of
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.700]   this framework together.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:52.660]   Now the question is, do you think that this is the best way, or maybe there are other
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:59.140]   ways that we can find the object that we should focus on?
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:07.480]   Obsess over its quality is enough to ask yourself, what it is that only I bring to this organization?
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.820]   And then obsess over its quality.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:16.860]   Thank you so much for your work, and I'm really glad that you mentioned slow food in your
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.860]   book.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:22.580]   I really hope that, who knows, maybe they're going to reach out to you.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:28.660]   As an Italian, I must say that I'm proud that you included it.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.480]   Thank you so much again, and have a great one.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   All right.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   Well, Giacomo, thank you for that question.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.920]   Coincidentally, I should say, I was just right before we recorded, was talking with my Italian
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   publisher.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.200]   So we're going to have an Italian version of Slow Productivity is coming out in June.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   So look out for that.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.840]   He was actually telling me my books do well over there.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.640]   Deep Work does well over there.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.760]   Digital Minimalism does well in Italy.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.680]   They more recently published So Good They Can't Ignore You, and they were a little bit
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.640]   worried because I wrote that 12 years ago, and that's doing well over there as well.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.440]   So I guess I'm connecting with the Italians, Jesse, I think.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.440]   That's good.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.680]   So June, I think, 11th or something like that, an Italian translated version of Slow Productivity
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.680]   will come out.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.680]   All right.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.720]   So it's a good question.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.200]   I might actually draw a little bit in answering this question for people who are watching
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.680]   instead of just listening.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:24.200]   So what Giacomo was asking about is how do I figure out what craft I'm pursuing in my
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.200]   job, right?
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.100]   Because again, it's this key idea in Slow Productivity is that when you turn your attention
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:33.240]   from activity and towards quality, producing something really well, all the other ideas
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.560]   become much more natural.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.720]   So you want to care about your craft.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.600]   He was suggesting, should I just say, what can I do that no one else can do?
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   I don't actually think that's necessarily going to be the most accurate way to do this.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.720]   So let me draw a picture here.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.000]   The Venn diagram, I'm going to draw two circles with an overlap.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.360]   So we're going to do a Venn diagram here.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.560]   All right.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.040]   And we are going to look at this intersection in the middle here.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.200]   So how would I label these two circles that we're looking at the intersection in the middle
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   of?
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   How would I label them?
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.160]   I'm going to label what I can do.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.520]   What I can do is going to be the first circle.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.600]   Notice I'm leaving off that no one else can.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:21.920]   Then over here, produces clear value.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.880]   So for your organization or for your company, whatever you do, this red circle are the things
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.560]   that clearly produce value.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.400]   So it's like, these are what ultimately get us new business, it's what the products that
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.240]   are paid for, it's the strategy that we bring to clients.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.040]   This intersection is what you should care about.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.480]   The things you can do, where it intersects with the things that produce clear value.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.520]   And there might be multiple things in here.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.600]   And there might be multiple people that correspond to any of the things in here, that's fine.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.200]   And what you do is you find something in this intersection.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.120]   All right, here's something I know how to do, preferably something that requires some
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.560]   sort of specialized training.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.680]   Let me get a big dot.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.680]   This is messy.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   Here, I'll put blue around the two.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.400]   Jesse, I'm getting abstract here.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   All right, whatever.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.640]   Here's something I can do.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   It's skilled.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.640]   It produces value.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.560]   They might have many options, choose one of those.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   And then you run with it.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:19.040]   I'm going to get better and better and better at this thing.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.440]   So the choice of what, it's not trivial to choose what you're going to get good at.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   It's not trivial, but it's also not impossibly hard.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   It shouldn't be too fraught.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.040]   There's some things I do that actually are non-trivial.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:34.280]   And some of these things also, I can tell matter in what I do for a living.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.220]   Let me choose one of those and really focus on getting better and better at that.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.400]   So that's how you figure that out, Giacomo.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:48.640]   And just to walk through the logic here, again, once you start really focusing on craft, busyness
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.120]   becomes more and more unnatural to you.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.040]   And it motivates you to go through the other principles of slow productivity to commit
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.680]   to those more strongly.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.040]   I want to be working on fewer things.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.280]   I want to have more of a natural pace.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.040]   I want to take longer on the stuff that matters because you're trying to get better at what
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   you're doing.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   All that becomes natural.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.480]   And then as you get better at what you're doing, you gain more control and leverage
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   over your job.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.760]   And then you're able to make even bigger demands about how many things you work on or the pace
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.760]   that you work on.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.500]   And it becomes a flywheel, a flywheel of slowness and quality.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:22.240]   So don't look for this perfect thing only you can do, but just find something you can
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.240]   do that's valuable.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.440]   Even if other people can do it, your goal is to do it better than them.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.760]   I'm going to get better at it than they are.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.680]   I'm going to focus on craft.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   So that's a good question.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.000]   That was, Giacomo, a good chance to qualify that.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.120]   All right.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.160]   I think we have a case study here as well.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   So let's see.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   We got a case study.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.640]   This is where people send in their stories of putting some of the ideas we talk about
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.920]   here into action.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:51.700]   This case study, actually, we don't have a name on this one, but we'll just call it anonymous.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:55.660]   I read Digital Minimalism and started applying its lessons.
[00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:00.620]   Since then, I have drastically increased how much I read, drastically increased how much
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:06.140]   I exercise, incrementally increased how much I sleep, significantly increased the amount
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:11.580]   of movies and video games I have actively and consciously consumed in contrast to passive
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.420]   or regretful consumption.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.960]   My case study is one of very slow and steady progress.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:24.460]   Here are some stats I compiled with my nerd spreadsheets comparing 2022 to 2023.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.420]   I doubled the amount of hours I read books, paper or ebook, while listening to the same
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.760]   amount of audiobooks.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.820]   I did 2.5 times the amount of strength training exercises and three times the amount of cardio
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.900]   workouts.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.580]   I increased the average sleep per night by about 20 to 30 minutes.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:44.120]   I increased the amount of video game hours put in by 30% and hours of shows and movies
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.360]   watched by 80%.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.280]   There are also some fuzzy or subjective improvements, but still worth noticing.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.100]   Subjective improvement in mood, maybe 10 to 25%, increased attention span as measured
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.660]   by being able to read for more than an hour in a single sitting, which was unheard of
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.980]   for me two years ago.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.580]   Now I can do that.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.500]   Increased attention to kids due to lack of phone usage when spending time with them.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.260]   I used the phone foyer method.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.660]   And mood and attention span improvements.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.200]   Reading time seems to be reduced, vaguely remember 4-5 hours daily previously, that's
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.860]   down to 1-2 hours, and that's mainly maps, podcasts, reading time trackers, and leaving
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.040]   my screen on after making a call or text.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.200]   I forget to charge my phone overnight and it is never a problem.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.120]   I have saved a few hundred dollars because I no longer feel any need to replace the phone
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.400]   I've had for 3+ years.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.480]   I like the quantitativeness there.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.280]   Most people don't like to track things so closely, and I think that's fine, that's a
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.320]   personality decision.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.100]   But I appreciate us being able to benefit from seeing the quantitative benefits of getting
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.420]   more intentional about your relationship with technology.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.380]   There's a lot of cool things in here, let me highlight a couple things.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.580]   The phone usage.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:55.980]   Phone foyer method is massive.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.660]   I put my phone in the same place in my house when I'm home.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.260]   If I need my phone, I go to that place to look something up or to make a call or to
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.140]   receive or send text messages, and then I leave the phone there and go back to what
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.740]   I'm doing.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.740]   That makes a big difference.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.500]   The phone is no longer a constant companion, it becomes instead an oracle.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:17.060]   Something you consult usefully as needed, not something that's always with you.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.500]   I also like this idea of attention span returning.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.900]   Like when you start to read on a regular basis, you get more comfortable reading.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:30.500]   And reading is a good proxy for basically any sustained concentration demanding activity.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:35.900]   The anonymous writer here says two years ago or more, the idea that he could read for a
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:40.300]   single hour and just do nothing but read for an hour was unheard of, and now he does it
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.020]   regularly.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.140]   More time spent with kids, big deal.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.500]   More time spent exercising.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.220]   When you get more intentional about your time and your technology, it really opens up a
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.220]   lot of things.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.060]   So we hear about all these things this person was doing that they weren't doing before.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.140]   And probably if we talked to this person before, they would just say, "How would I ever have
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.140]   time to read?
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.300]   How would I ever have time to exercise?"
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.660]   And it turns out like, oh, you had more time than you thought, but the technology was stealing
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.060]   and monetizing it.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.540]   So these moments that you could have spent making your life and your family's life better
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:20.100]   was instead being spent implicitly toiling in the salt mines of these attention economy
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.180]   companies, looking at their content to make them more money.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.180]   So you sort of regained that.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.620]   So anyway, this is a cool case study.
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.260]   He says this is digital minimalism in action.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.900]   Yeah, it is digital minimalism, but it's like the whole program here in action.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.900]   So that was cool to see.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:37.060]   All right, so we have a final segment coming up, but first, Jesse, let's hear from another
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.060]   sponsor.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:43.760]   I want to talk about our friends at Shopify, right?
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:52.300]   Shopify is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:57.300]   from the launch your online shop stage to the first real life store stage, all the way
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.780]   to the did we just hit a million order stage.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.540]   Shopify is here to help you grow.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.980]   They have an all in one e-commerce platform.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.920]   You could be selling things in a store.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.320]   They have the point of sale systems that make that easy.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.340]   You can be selling things online.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.360]   Best e-commerce setup makes it easy for you to sell things online, gives the users this
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.820]   like fantastic checkout shopping cart experience.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:26.820]   If you're selling things, Shopify is who you should be using.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.480]   It is definitely what Jesse and I will use when we, and I don't say if, I say when we
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:39.300]   launch our long rumored deep questions store with confusing t-shirt slogans, Shopify is
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:44.620]   absolutely what we're going to use to rack up our, and I want to be conservative here,
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.260]   Jesse, but I'm talking like tens of orders that we'll probably get.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.420]   But here's the thing, as we go from tens of orders to a million orders, Shopify can be
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:05:00.380]   there for you, whether you're selling a little or a lot, Shopify helps you do your thing,
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.460]   however you cha-ching.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:08.120]   So sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.940]   Just be sure you type that all lowercase.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:17.260]   Go to shopify.com/deep now to grow your business, no matter what stage you're in, that's shopify.com/deep.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:23.180]   I also want to talk about our friends at MyBodyTutor.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.200]   I've known Adam Gilbert, MyBodyTutor's founder for many years.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.660]   He used to be the fitness advice guy for my study hacks blog, and I've kept in touch with
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.660]   him ever since.
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.780]   MyBodyTutor is a brilliant company because it solves a real problem in a smart way.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:43.380]   It's a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.380]   which is consistency.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.140]   It's not too hard to figure out what you should be doing with your diet and exercise.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.460]   It's hard to keep doing it.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:54.660]   It's hard to adapt that when the situation temporarily changes, like you're traveling
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.260]   or it's the holidays.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:01.740]   MyBodyTutor solves this by giving you an online coach, a coach that's dedicated to you.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.900]   They help you make your plan for nutrition.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:09.140]   They help you make your plan for fitness, and you check in every day.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.300]   Here's how it went.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.460]   If you have a question, they give you feedback.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.580]   If you need encouragement, they give you encouragement.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:17.300]   You need to modify your plan for whatever, business travel, they help you do that exactly
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.300]   for you.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:22.340]   You get all the power of having a trainer that's working straight with you without the
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.580]   expense of having to have someone come to your actual house.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:30.020]   Because it's done online, it becomes a lot more affordable.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:33.460]   If you're serious about getting fit, Adam is giving Deep Questions listeners $50 off
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.740]   their first month.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:39.540]   All you have to do is mention the Deep Questions podcast when you join.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:44.180]   Go to MyBodyTutor, that's T-U-T-O-R dot com, and mention Deep Questions when you sign up
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.900]   and you'll get $50 off your first month.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:51.380]   All right, let's do our final segment.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:56.060]   There's a thing we used to do, long-time listeners know it, called Deep or Crazy, where I would
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:01.380]   talk about some sort of scheme I had, some sort of dubious thing I've invested money
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:09.100]   in and Jesse would be our arbiter to determine was this decision a bid for living a deeper
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.660]   life or is it crazy.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.660]   You remember this game, Jesse.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.380]   We've been doing this one for a little while.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:21.680]   I have three things that get maybe increasingly outlandish, either decisions I've made or
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.620]   I'm thinking about making.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:31.980]   Number one, I have tricked out the studio here at the Deep Work HQ with a really nice
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.140]   teleprompter system.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.500]   I'm actually looking right now into a teleprompter.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:40.180]   I can see my own face reflected up on the screen, so I'm looking at my own eyes, but
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.980]   actually I'm staring down the barrel of the camera.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:49.380]   When I'm doing interviews, remote interviews, I can have the interviewer's face right in
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:53.540]   front of me, so I could be making direct eye contact but staring down the barrel.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.020]   This is an Elgato teleprompter.
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:00.340]   I just set it up, so I thought this would be good because I spend a lot of time in here.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.140]   This is where maybe it gets a little bit more outlandish, Jesse.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:09.620]   I also was thinking, "Hey, when I just do normal Zoom calls for work with my publishing
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:16.340]   team with faculty meetings at Georgetown, it's a waste not to use this nice studio I
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.340]   have."
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:27.180]   And so I also bought a pretty good Rode condenser shotgun microphone that I can put off camera
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:30.620]   aimed at me, so now I can do a Zoom meeting.
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.420]   I can be looking down the barrel of Zoom, but really be looking into my pretty nice
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:38.620]   Sony a6400 and have no mics because when you're on a Zoom meeting for work, you don't want
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.800]   to have a broadcast mic and headphones on.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.420]   So I'll be completely mic-free, but well-lit with three-point lighting, looking down the
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.660]   barrel, really good audio, but with an off-camera microphone.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:59.900]   All right, so the question, this upgrade of the studio, Jesse, deep or crazy?
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.900]   Very deep.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.900]   All right.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.220]   The only thing you have to figure out is the shirt you're going to wear for these new things.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:13.180]   I'm thinking no shirt, is that you put a pull-up bar, get a pump going, and then just do every
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:17.700]   meeting like they do in the Marvel movies where they're holding a really hard-
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.500]   The new Roadhouse with Conor McGregor?
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.260]   And they're always holding a flex because they want to look good.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:29.900]   That's going to be my flex is in a very sort of unsettling way, just sort of be shirtless
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.540]   in Zoom meetings.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.940]   All right.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.980]   Second thing, I'm upgrading the makerspace part.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:43.300]   So the DeepWork HQ has a studio, it has a makerspace/production office, and then has
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.860]   like a conference room.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:50.660]   And so I'm upgrading the makerspace because I have a lot of making I want to do and I
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:55.100]   want to clean it up and get stuff stored better, and me and my sons are working on various
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.100]   things.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.980]   I want to make the makerspace more usable, I'm going to put up a pegboard and get a lot
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.220]   of stuff off the desk and-
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.660]   Just get it organized.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:08.100]   Get organized because I'm learning CAD design because I want to be able to build sort of
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:12.220]   custom 3D print components and cases for the microelectronics I'm building, et cetera.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.500]   So I'm excited about that.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.940]   I felt compelled as part of doing this to really upgrade the computer system in there.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:24.180]   And all this stuff arrived, by the way, Jesse, I haven't brought it over yet.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:27.860]   But we have a nice external monitor in there, I bought another one.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:34.180]   And I got the dual Jarvis Herman Miller sort of monitor, free-floating dual monitor stands.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.540]   You'll be able to position those two monitors like however you want them.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:44.260]   And then I invested in like a pretty good mid-range Mac computer, a Mac Studio, which
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   is like a step above an iMac or a Mac Mini, but a step below the Mac Pro.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.300]   It's a pretty powerful computer, it's got a good amount of RAM.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:57.060]   It's got a big multi-core GPU in there.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.860]   It's something you would use for like pretty serious 3D design or video editing.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.620]   So I'm telling myself, well, Jesse, you do some video editing in there.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.420]   So this, you're going to have dual screens and like a beast of a computer for video processing
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:12.580]   that can like really, it can do 4K, even 8K, like whatever you need to do.
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.940]   And I do 3D design and my son does 3D design.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.220]   And so we're like, yeah, we can do rendering and we can do slices for our 3D printer and
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.960]   everything's going to be really fast.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.980]   It's probably like 5X more powerful than it needs to be.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.100]   But I just like the idea of my maker lab of just, this was like my gift to myself for
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:32.540]   the book launch of just having like a beastly computer system set up in there.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.540]   100% deep.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:39.540]   Because also you got to consider back in the day when you remember you had the noise that
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.580]   was bothering you and you were thinking about moving studios to maybe a potentially more
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.180]   expensive studio.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:47.780]   And now, I mean, we stayed and you're probably, you know, got a decent deal.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:49.500]   So you're saving, you know, funds on that as well.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.500]   You're right.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.500]   We could have been spending a lot more money.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.500]   I don't know how we got rid of that hump.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.420]   Oh, I fixed it eventually by just like changing certain, turning down certain gains and turning
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.220]   up other gains.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.260]   I solved that problem with a time honored of like turn offs.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:07.340]   But yeah, you're definitely, you're definitely allowed to like beef up the maker computer
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:08.340]   room now.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.340]   I want to like be like writing my program and doing like my CAD designs and like the
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:14.940]   big monitor and like dragging things over and put into the 3D printer and I have my
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.540]   desk where I'm doing whatever.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.300]   And okay, I like big computers too.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.420]   I just hang some of those pictures up there.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   Gonna hang some pictures.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.780]   I'm buying a cool, I have a cool piece of artwork I'm buying for in there as well.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.780]   That's awesome.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780]   So everything is going to be covered in there.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   It's going to be a cool space.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:30.780]   All right.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.780]   So we've got two deeps.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.340]   The final thing is in the maker lab and this, I mean, I think this one is just like from
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.540]   a professional perspective, probably very necessary.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.540]   I want to move the fridge.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.540]   We'll move that somewhere else.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:44.460]   We've got plenty of room for the fridge and I want to replace that with a street fighter
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.260]   video game cabinet.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.860]   Crazy, crazy.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.900]   Oh, that one might be crazy.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.580]   I might do that though.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.580]   I like the idea.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:01.820]   I mean, I was looking at these video game cabinets and I didn't want a game that is
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.660]   of the style of like you try to play as long as you can, like a standard video game.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:08.900]   I wanted something like if I was here, I'm here with like my sons, like you're like,
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.020]   okay, we got to like clear our head for five minutes or two minutes.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.260]   You can like jump on and play one fight and then like that's done and then you can get
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.140]   back to whatever else you're doing.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.020]   And I remember street fighter very well from my childhood.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:25.980]   So I'm eyeing a street fighter video game cabinet, not vintage, not vintage.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.340]   I went down the track of vintage.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.220]   Vintage is hard.
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.220]   They break.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.220]   They're big.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.300]   They're going to be hard to get up here.
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.980]   Are you talking like an arcade thing?
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.980]   Like you stand at it with the like, yeah, the controllers.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:47.220]   Um, so I looked in the vintage, what I really wanted was pre microprocessor electronics,
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.220]   like the original pong and breakouts.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.540]   That's like impossible to find.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:54.860]   Um, I did find a really good company in the DC area that could refurbish like an actual
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:59.140]   like vintage cabinet, but I worry about them being too big to get up here and it might
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.660]   take up like more space than we think.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.460]   And because the stairs are narrow and it's for the audience, it's a mini fridge.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.460]   So it's, yeah, right, right, right, right.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.860]   It's not like we're moving a huge fridge.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.860]   We're replacing, like, it's not a big space.
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.860]   We're putting this in.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.660]   Um, so I worried about that and they break easily and then you have to have like the
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.820]   team come out or whatever.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:18.060]   So there, there's a compromise is there, there are a couple of companies that just, they,
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:22.980]   they build these things new, um, and they come, you, you, they come in pieces and you
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.980]   reconstruct them.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.980]   It's not vintage electronics.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.300]   It's actually like a nice new screen and just running off of a, uh, emulator.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.700]   Um, so, but it's a smaller footprint.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.260]   Uh, it's like it would fit in there without thinking, and it was still solved the problem.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.460]   Um, it was still solved the problem of like, I liked the idea in there just like having
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.620]   something like from my childhood that you could go over there for five minutes and like
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.940]   clear your head and then get back to like whatever you're working on.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.620]   So I'm writing at my major monitors, like working on a project, whatever.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.940]   You can just like roll over there and like do a couple of fights and then like get back
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.940]   to what you're doing.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.940]   That's so good.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940]   All right.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:00.820]   So we've got two deeps in a crazy, I'm going to do all three of them, I think.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:02.820]   Great.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:03.820]   All right.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:04.820]   All right.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   Well, we haven't done that in a while, but I'm glad to have a chance to do it.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.380]   Um, I guess it's all the time we have.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.380]   So we'll be back next week.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.580]   Uh, the episode again, if all goes well, we'll be releasing the episode that we're going
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:16.460]   to tape on Thursday at people's book.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.540]   Maybe we'll delay when we release that, but I kind of want to release that as the next
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:20.540]   week's episode.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.540]   So it's timely.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.540]   So we can talk about stuff that happens.
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.540]   That'll be fun.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.300]   So we'll have a lot of like in-person questions.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.300]   So stay tuned.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.300]   You'll like that episode next week.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:33.100]   Um, and whether we see you then, or you encounter us at our next episode, uh, stay deep.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:38.260]   Hey, so if you like today's discussion about social media technology and the deep life,
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:44.860]   you might also like the discussion from episode two 93, where we got into how technology could
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:50.660]   help us do administrative tasks in particular, what will be required for AI to clean your
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.660]   inbox.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.660]   That was a really fun discussion.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.660]   I think you might like it.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.660]   Check it out.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:58.660]   For a large group of people, a big part of our audience, perhaps the even more pressing
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.600]   question about AI is the following.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.260]   When will it be able to empty my email inbox on my behalf?
