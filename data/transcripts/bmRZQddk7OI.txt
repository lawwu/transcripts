[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   If you're a bridesmaid or a groomsman in a wedding,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.300]   the only thing I'll tell you is please, please,
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.360]   please understand that you're allowed to say no.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.360]   We often think that if we take on that role,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.840]   we have to say yes to everything,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.360]   but if there's something you can't afford,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.600]   you don't want to do, or you don't have time for,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.320]   make sure you say no.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.700]   How do you say no?
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.320]   You simply say, hey, thanks so much
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.100]   for asking me to do that, but at this time,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.840]   that's just not something that I can swing.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.440]   Happy to help in other ways.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.440]   Keep it easy, keep it friendly,
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.000]   but make sure you stand up for yourself and say no.
