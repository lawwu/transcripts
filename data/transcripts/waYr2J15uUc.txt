[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   The fraction 1/99^2 generates as its decimals something that looks a lot like the non-negative
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.360]   integers.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.960]   Why is that?
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400]   Showing this fraction as this kind of sum may give you a hint.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.720]   But let's take a look further.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.800]   Let's use this geometric series here that holds true for when the absolute value of
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.920]   x is less than 1.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.880]   1/(1-x) is equal to 1+x+x^2+x^3 and so on.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:44.760]   Taking the derivative of both sides, the equality still holds true, resulting in 1/(1-x^2)=1+2x+3x^2+4x^3
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   and so on.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.360]   Now here's how we get back to the magical fraction that generates something very close
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.700]   to the non-negative integers.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.800]   We plug in 1/100 into x.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.640]   The result on the left hand side is our fraction, 1/99^2.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:13.640]   And on the right hand side, the sum 1/100^2+2/100^3+3/100^4 and so on.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.280]   And when we take the sum, we get that nice sequence of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on that we
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.840]   saw before.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.160]   Now if we return to the derivative of the geometric series that we saw before and plug
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.000]   in x=1/100, we get the fraction that we started the video with.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.760]   But we can actually change the number of padding 0s in the decimal sequence that's generated
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.280]   by changing the value of x.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.240]   For x of 1/10, the fraction is 1/9^2 or 1/81 and the padding is less.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.680]   For x of 1/1000, the fraction is 1/999^2 and the padding is greater.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.040]   And you can arbitrarily increase the denominator of x by multiples of 10 to increase the padding
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.580]   on the resulting decimal sequence.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.580]   So there you have it.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.760]   There's a little bit of math that shows how a strange little fraction can generate a beautiful
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.740]   decimal sequence.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.980]   You may have noticed that in this case, the number 98 is missing.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.780]   The number 98 is not missing in the underlying summation.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.680]   But since we're doing base 10 arithmetic, eventually the numbers overflow, resulting
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.280]   in a decimal sequence that's missing the number 98 before it starts repeating.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.120]   So while the underlying summation includes the non-negative integers, the resulting representation
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   of the number in decimal form in base 10 notation actually is missing the number 98 and is actually
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.080]   a repeating decimal.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.560]   I hope you enjoyed these little videos.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.160]   They're easy and fun for me to make and allow me to share some basic and advanced ideas
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   in mathematics, computer science, physics, machine learning, and also into the softer
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.320]   sciences of psychology, history, philosophy, and so on.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.040]   I look forward to sharing these with you.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.160]   And remember, try to learn something new every day.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   Thanks.
