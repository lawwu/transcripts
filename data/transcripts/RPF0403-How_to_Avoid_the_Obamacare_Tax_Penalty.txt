[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.640]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.560]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.580]   Today we continue our discussion on health insurance generally with a specific focus
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.800]   on Obamacare, specifically today.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.760]   I've been needing to get this out for a couple of weeks here and here and as I record this
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.720]   and release this on December 6, 2016, we've got just a little bit of about a month left
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.720]   before open enrollment ends for the healthcare exchanges.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.760]   And so I obviously got to get this information to you if it's going to be useful.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.460]   So we're going to be doing a lot of health insurance this week and if there's anything
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.160]   less left next week as well.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800]   Today we cover three specific topics.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.400]   I'm going to talk through the Obamacare penalty.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.600]   I want to explain to you what it is, do some actual calculations so that you know how it
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.920]   impacts you.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.280]   Next I want to talk about what happens if you don't pay the penalty.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.640]   And number three, I want to talk to you about how to get out of paying the penalty.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.440]   That's the content of today's show.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.640]   Before we get to that, a couple of quick announcements and one ad for you.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.040]   On announcement number one, as I mentioned on a recent show, I've opened up the Radical
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120]   Personal Finance Facebook group to the community in general.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.480]   I've had a couple of hundred of you who have gone ahead and joined us there and in the
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.720]   Radical Personal Finance Facebook community.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.040]   It was previously limited only to patrons of the show.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.320]   At this point in time, it's now broadly available.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.160]   So if you are a Facebooker and you've got questions or you'd like to interact with a
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.520]   very smart, very knowledgeable community of people, head on over to Facebook, search for
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   Radical Personal Finance, and you will find the community Facebook group.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.880]   I invite you to join us there.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.520]   Number two, big focus for this year, December here as we go into the year, I would really
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.600]   desperately like very much to raise the number of reviews for Radical Personal Finance with
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.400]   a specific focus on iTunes, but also some of the other platforms.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   My target goal is to get to a thousand here within the next couple of months, and we're
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.680]   currently at about 333, actually not about, exactly 333.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.780]   There are about 10,000 of you who listen every day on iOS devices.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.760]   If you have an iPhone, if you could do me one quick favor, when you're at a traffic
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.680]   light, if you're listening to me while you're driving down the road, just pull open the
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.520]   Apple Podcasts app.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.060]   It's the app that's automatically installed on your phone.
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.060]   Pull that little thing open.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.060]   Just search.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.680]   Use the search function, search podcast, and you'll find it, or it's purple and it says
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.160]   podcast underneath.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.440]   Use the Apple Podcast app and search for Radical Personal Finance in the store and just click
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.140]   leave a rating and review.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.880]   You can just simply leave a quick star rating for the show and one or two sentences on your
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.860]   phone would be perfect.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.040]   It's largely about, at this point in time, as far as helping the show grow and attain
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.360]   visibility, the number of reviews is quite valuable and quite helpful.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.680]   Like I said, currently at 333.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   My target goal is to raise that number to a thousand here within the next month or two.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.060]   So if you could help me with that, I would be deeply indebted to you.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.800]   One or two sentences is perfect and it'll just take about two or three minutes right
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   on your phone.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.120]   Super easy if you've never done that.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.560]   Finally, quick announcement here in December, quick ad.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   I do phone consulting and I haven't made a big press on this, but I'm going to be doing
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.460]   a lot more press as far as announcements and advertisements and things for you.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.280]   But I have been doing phone consulting with listeners of the audience.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.640]   At this point in time, I've been doing about 50 individual private phone calls.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.200]   If you've ever thought about talking to me, if you hear some of the ideas and the things
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.920]   that I share and you'd like to get some specific advice on your specific situation, I encourage
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   you to consider booking a phone call with me.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.320]   Let me read you a couple of reviews from some of the phone calls that I have done.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.200]   You can find these on the Clarity profile, which you go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.640]   That forwards you through to the profile where you can book a phone call with me.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.400]   Review here from LS.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.160]   "We had a very informative conversation with Joshua Sheets.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   We wanted help selecting a financial advisor for our family and he was very knowledgeable
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and helpful.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.720]   He both expanded our thinking while at the same time helped us get focused on a decision."
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   Another one from JR.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   "Amazing call.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.680]   Once again, Joshua Sheets delivers tremendous value."
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   By the way, these are all paid calls, not free calls or any gimmicks like that.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.400]   "BS, Joshua was well prepared and the call was a great use of my time and money.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   I left the call feeling more confident as I go forward with my upcoming financial decision."
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   JK.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.760]   "The opportunity to speak with Joshua personally was a valuable opportunity in itself, but
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.600]   our conversation yielded several useful takeaways.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   This is the kick in the pants I was looking for."
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.160]   Finally, "Joshua is a very organized way when it comes to thinking about financial
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   topics.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.640]   He helped me finalize my decisions through this call."
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.240]   So a lot of your fellow listeners have booked consulting calls with me and have found a
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.680]   great deal of value in that.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.120]   If you're struggling with a specific decision, let me tell you this.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.080]   Financial advice is not cheap when you measure it on a per minute basis.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.720]   My hourly rate here is 300 bucks an hour, so that comes out to $5 a minute.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.640]   That advice is not cheap when measured on an hourly basis.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.940]   That's just basically a standard professional rate.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.200]   But in terms of the impact, I don't believe there's any better bang for the buck that
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.660]   you can get than good, useful, practical financial advice.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.140]   So if you've ever wanted my input on a specific situation with you, I get a hopeless number
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.520]   of emails that I can't respond to at this point in time.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   As I've opened up the Facebook community, there's a hopeless number of posts in there
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   that I try to read and get a grasp of what's going on, but I can't respond to there.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   But money speaks, and I am presently offering this consulting call service.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.820]   As we're here in December 2016, heading into a new year, if you are thinking about
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.440]   your financial goals for the next year, if you'd like some help organizing your thoughts
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.320]   and organizing your ideas on that, consider booking a phone call with me, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.400]   Again, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.360]   I think you'd be glad you did.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.220]   Let's go on and talk about Obamacare now.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.400]   So thing number one, what is the Obamacare penalty?
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.680]   So to refresh, meaning, okay, we get that there's a penalty if you don't have health
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.660]   insurance, but we want to talk about how is it calculated.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.120]   To refresh your memory, it's important to recognize that given the nature of health
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:50.400]   insurance, recognizing that the legislative intent of the Affordable Care Act was to open
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.120]   up health insurance to every person in the United States.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.520]   That was the goal, make health insurance available to every person in the United States.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:08.400]   The problem is that if you do that, it opens the insurance company up to the risk of adverse
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   selection.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.840]   It breaks the model because people who are sick and have a lot of health problems are
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.240]   much more likely to want insurance than those who are healthy and don't have any known health
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.780]   problems.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.560]   And so if the sample of insureds in a health insurance risk pool is not representative
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.880]   of the general population, then the actuarial tables that govern the pricing of insurance
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.960]   get broken.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.680]   So because the legislative intent was to open up health insurance to every person, regardless
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.840]   of preexisting condition, regardless of how bad of a health risk somebody is, there had
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:59.680]   to be some kind of mechanism in order to try to ensure that the people getting health insurance
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.760]   would be reflective of the general population.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.440]   Now given that politically it was not feasible for the legislators in charge at that point
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.800]   in time to accomplish what I think most would have liked to have accomplished, which was
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:20.040]   to have a universal government-run health insurance system just like Medicare or Medicaid,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.640]   because that was not politically feasible, they tried to find a compromise position.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.880]   And the compromise position was to incentivize all people to join the health insurance rolls
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.240]   by invoking a penalty for the people who chose not to buy health insurance.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:44.280]   It was hoped that this penalty would incentivize 100 percent – of course they knew it wouldn't
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.320]   be 100 percent – but it was hoped that it would incentivize 100 percent of all US Americans
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   to go into the world of health insurance, purchase and maintain health insurance coverage
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.200]   in order that the health insurance companies could have a risk pool that was actually reflective
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.600]   of the entire population because it included the entire population.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.500]   That was the goal.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.780]   Now this penalty faced a couple of difficult legislative options.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:19.220]   It was adjudicated all the way up to the Supreme Court and quite famously it was defended as
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.960]   it not being a tax and then it was called to be a tax.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.920]   Anyway, we'll skip the legislative history of it.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.880]   But it was adjudicated up to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court ruled that it was indeed
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.280]   a constitutional tax.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:38.720]   It was quite the remarkable and interesting judicial history where the congress evidently
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.800]   unintentionally wound up advocating and establishing a constitutional tax based upon the ruling
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   of the Supreme Court.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.600]   So that system of penalties or let's call it tax has been in place.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.120]   But there's been a lot of confusion about it because it started off not being very much
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   money.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.700]   It started off being only a couple of hundred dollars in terms of the actual cost and many
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:07.680]   people made the decision that they did not value having health insurance to the degree
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.000]   that it would cost them premiums.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.200]   I'm not one of those who just automatically dismisses that.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.540]   I think that it's your money and you can make a rational and careful and thoughtful decision
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.720]   about it and I think you should do so.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.220]   I do not fault the many people who make a conscious decision to avoid having health
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.220]   insurance.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.100]   I myself do not have any health insurance.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.800]   We'll cover that in a participate in a health sharing program.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.920]   My intention is to do that with the next episode probably tomorrow.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.840]   So I don't think it's irrational not to have health insurance.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.600]   There's a cost and a benefit of all things and you have to weigh the costs and you have
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.060]   to weigh the benefits and you're the one who knows the most about your personal situation.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.480]   That's what leads to the problem of adverse selection.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.000]   Those of you who are very healthy, who don't have any pre-existing health conditions, who
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.960]   aren't aware of any known maladies, who generally have a fairly safe lifestyle, I think it's
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.560]   a perfectly sensible and rational economic decision to say that I'll choose to self-insure
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:14.120]   the potential risk of my health expenses and I just simply will forego participating in
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.560]   the health insurance system.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   In general, health insurance does provide a very important financial backstop against
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   financial ruin.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.640]   That's the proper role of health insurance.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.000]   But when the cost of the premiums rises to the point where it's almost inevitable financial
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   ruin based upon paying the premiums, the whole point of health insurance basically conceptually
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.920]   falls apart.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.420]   So in the beginning years, these penalties that were imposed for Obamacare were relatively
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.920]   small numbers, a few hundred dollars.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.040]   I can't remember the first year was $195, $295, something like that.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.920]   Today they've gone a little bit higher.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.120]   So let's talk about how to actually calculate the fees so that you can understand the potential
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.000]   impact on your situation.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.720]   Now here I'm going to be referencing the information that is available directly from healthcare.gov.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.520]   I'm actually going to read their paperwork and read their financial calculations to you
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.080]   from healthcare.gov.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.600]   And this information is current as for 2015, excuse me, 2016.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.520]   This is the fees for 2016.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.920]   If you don't have health insurance or didn't have health insurance throughout 2016.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.880]   The fee that you would pay, they still call it a fee.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.160]   They should call it a tax because that was what it was ruled as.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.960]   Anyway, the penalty tax that you will pay is calculated in two different ways and you
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.240]   will pay whichever of these is higher.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:47.960]   Again there are two calculations and you will pay the higher calculation.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.840]   These fees will adjust with inflation so you have to rerun the calculation each year.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:02.440]   The first way that the penalty tax is calculated is based upon a percentage of income.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:11.600]   And your tax, if you do not maintain health insurance coverage, will be 2.5% of your annual
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.560]   household income.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:23.720]   Again your tax will be 2.5% of your annual household income.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.760]   Now there is a maximum on this.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.560]   If you have a $1 million annual household income and you do not have health insurance,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.760]   your annual tax will not be $25,000.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.440]   The reason is that the maximum amount here is the total yearly premium for the national
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.400]   average price of a bronze health insurance plan that is sold through the marketplace.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.120]   So bronze premiums for a bronze insurance plan would be significantly below $25,000
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.700]   per year.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.320]   Bronze is the lowest tier plan that's offered and the bronze, silver, gold classification
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.400]   from healthcare.gov.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.600]   And so that will be the maximum amount.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:14.080]   The idea is if you're going to be paying 2.5% of your income and it's going to be at
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:21.000]   least as much as the cost of a bronze plan, then why would you not go ahead and get the
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.760]   health insurance policy?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.800]   That's the idea here.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.240]   Recognizing also that of course we have the premium tax credits which make a substantial
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.960]   difference in the cost of the insurance programs for those who are lower to middle income.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:43.720]   And those numbers as we referenced in episode 397 called the health insurance series part
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.880]   3, the premium tax credit, what it is, how it works and how to maximize your cash from
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   it.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.760]   As we referenced those numbers there in that show, the premium tax credit will have a high
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:59.800]   degree of impact on low to even middle to middle upper income households.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:05.120]   So way of calculating fee number one, percentage of income, it's 2.5% of your household income
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:13.160]   subject to a maximum which is the average total yearly premium for the national average
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.840]   price of a bronze plan that's sold through the health insurance marketplace.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:32.080]   The other way that the fee is calculated is as a flat fee of $695 per adult and $347.50
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.000]   per child under the age of 18.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   So let's just call it $700 per adult and $350 per child.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.240]   Flat fee and this is how the penalty is taken out of the world of income because some people
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.720]   don't have a high income and so therefore this is where the penalty is taken out.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:03.520]   Now this calculation is subject to a maximum annual penalty of $2085.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.440]   So if you were to run the math on that, let's just call it $2000 minus $700 for one adult
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.960]   in the household minus $700 for a second adult in the household, you're left with $600.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.780]   Basically you wind up with two adults and two children in a household and you're going
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.800]   to be over the maximum fee, maximum amount $2085.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:30.120]   You will pay whichever of these numbers is higher.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.520]   A few more details for you.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.280]   When using the percentage method, only the part of your household income that's above
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:47.820]   the yearly tax filing threshold, which is $10,150 for individuals or $20,300 for couples
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:53.640]   filing jointly in 2014, which is the most recent year available, is counted.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:01.800]   If your income is below the threshold for a requirement to file tax returns, yes, it
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.760]   is possible for you not to be required to file a tax return if your income is low enough.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   If your income is below that threshold, you won't incur the penalty.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:16.820]   But the income that is below that number is not counted in these penalties.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:24.320]   Using the per person method, you pay only for people in your household who don't have
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.400]   insurance coverage.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.040]   Again, using the per person method, you pay only for people in your household who don't
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.720]   have insurance coverage.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.320]   So your fee will not include people who do have coverage.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:47.800]   If you have coverage for part of the year, the fee is 1/12th of the annual amount for
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:54.380]   each month you or your tax dependents don't have coverage.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:18:00.660]   If you're uncovered only one or two months, you don't have to pay the fee at all.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.360]   So that's where one of the exemptions, if you're just missing coverage for one or two
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.520]   months, there is no fee, but if it's more than that, then the fee is prorated for each
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.980]   month that you don't have coverage.
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.560]   And finally, you pay the fee when you file your federal tax return for the year that
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.040]   you don't have coverage.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.000]   So let's do a few numbers here, some examples that the IRS gives us in their guidance documents
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.420]   here from healthcare.gov so that we can understand how this works.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.860]   If you numbers make your eyes swim, just skip forward a couple of minutes.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.780]   Example number one, a single individual with $40,000 of income.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.980]   Jim, who is unmarried with no dependents, doesn't have qualifying health coverage for
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.060]   any month of 2016.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.820]   His household income in 2016 is $40,000.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.100]   So it's simple.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:57.300]   His per person fee would be $695 just for him.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.680]   His percentage of income fee would be calculated in this way.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:09.500]   You take $40,000, his 2016 household income, subtract $10,150, which is the tax filing
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:16.060]   threshold for individuals in 2014, the most recent year available, which equals an annual
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.780]   income of $29,850.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:31.060]   Then you take 2.5% of that number, 2.5% of $29,850 would be $746.25.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:37.780]   The annual national average premium for a bronze plan is $2,448.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:49.040]   $746.25, which is Jim's percentage of income fee, is less than $2,448, which is the maximum
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.220]   percentage of income fee, so the maximum doesn't apply.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:20:01.060]   But $746.25, Jim's percentage of income fee, is higher than $695, his per person fee.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:08.340]   So his 2016 tax penalty would be $746.25, which he would pay upon the filing of his
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.060]   2016 federal income tax return.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:18.800]   Now if he'd had partial coverage for any month of 2016, he would ... not partial coverage.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.900]   If he'd had health coverage for any month of 2016, then he would just simply owe 1/12
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:29.100]   of the annual fee for each month that he's uninsured.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.300]   Example number two, married couple with two children, $70,000 of income.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.620]   Eduardo and Julia are married and have two children under 18.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.660]   I guess I kind of assumed Julia, and it says Julia.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.540]   Anyway, Eduardo and Julia are married and have two children under 18.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:50.220]   No family member has qualifying health coverage for any month of 2016, and the 2016 household
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.640]   income is $70,000.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:59.620]   So first calculate the per person fee, $2,085, which is two adults at $695 each, plus two
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:05.500]   children at $347.50 each.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.480]   Percentage of income fee, you take $70,000, subtract out the $20,300 tax filing threshold
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.800]   for married couples filing jointly, which equals $49,700, and take 2.5% of that, comes
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.200]   out to be $1,242.50.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.400]   You take the maximum cost of the bronze plan, average national premium for that size family
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:36.080]   would be $9,792 per year, and then you calculate, and obviously the percentage of income fee
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:42.420]   of $1,242.50 would be less than the maximum, so the maximum doesn't apply, but the per
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:49.600]   person fee of $2,085 is higher than $1,242.50.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:57.280]   Their fee would be the higher one of $2,085, which they would pay when they file the 2016
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.880]   federal income tax return.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:11.480]   Now, even just looking at that number, that would be a scenario that is common.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.440]   Married couple, two children, $70,000 household income.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   They're going to be paying a $2,085 fee.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.920]   Is it rational for them to do that?
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.800]   Well, it depends on the cost of the bronze plan.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:30.200]   Now, remember the bronze plan here is $9,792.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.920]   There's a major cost savings there.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.320]   Those cost savings would generally be offset by the premium tax credit.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.600]   So I didn't run the numbers in preparation for the show, but they wouldn't be paying
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:47.680]   $9,792 because of the benefit of the premium tax credit.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.960]   But still, $2,085 is a significant discount in terms of, "Okay, fine.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.120]   I got to deal with this."
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.920]   But now we come to the second part.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.220]   Hopefully you understand how the fees work and you've seen how these fees have steadily
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.720]   increased over the last few years.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.020]   Until now, they are substantial.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.480]   Most people are not going to choose, even if they have other reasons not to participate
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.760]   in the health insurance marketplace, most people aren't going to choose to incur a $2,000
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.040]   fee when they could come up with some other option, including just simply buying the bronze
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.400]   plan, having the cost rebated by the premium tax credit, and financially it will make – it
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.640]   will tend in their direction where they'll just say, "Well, it makes more sense to go
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.880]   ahead and get the coverage through the healthcare.gov website."
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.040]   That's the whole point of it.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.120]   But here's the question.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.040]   What happens if you don't pay the penalty?
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:46.160]   Now, this is one of the more interesting and controversial questions that I've been aware
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.280]   of for the last few years.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.880]   I researched it as extensively as I could in preparation for this show.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.440]   Still, I'm even in some ways uncomfortable talking about it because it seems so counterintuitive.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:06.840]   But at this point in time, the penalty for not paying – the consequences for not paying
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.040]   this penalty are limited.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.640]   First I'll describe to you the situation.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.240]   Then I'll read a couple – an article that goes into details.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   But basically, as I understand the current law and the current circumstances, the only
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.280]   way that the IRS – because the IRS was tasked with collecting these penalty fees.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:32.800]   The only way that the IRS can collect the Affordable Care Act penalty is if you choose
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:44.160]   to pay it voluntarily or if they take it out of a refund that is due to you.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.820]   This is unlike any other tax law.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:55.840]   In the United States of America, if you owe tax and if you do not pay your tax, the IRS
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:03.240]   has been granted the legal authority to impose significant negative sanctions on you.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.040]   These sanctions would include the garnishment of your wages.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.280]   These sanctions would include the cleaning out of your accounts, bank accounts.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:21.560]   These sanctions would include the repossession of – involuntary repossession of your property,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.740]   of your physical property.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.480]   They can come and take your physical assets, take your furniture, take your house, take
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.760]   your cars, all that stuff and sell it.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.060]   These sanctions even include prison.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:39.700]   The IRS has legal authority to, upon successful judgment, lawsuit, etc., to put you in prison
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.560]   for not paying your taxes.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.580]   The full weight of the law comes down upon you if you do not pay taxes.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.000]   Now they generally only do this as an example.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.180]   The IRS depends upon voluntary taxpayer support, voluntary taxpayer participation in order
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.220]   to manage the tax system in the United States of America.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:08.080]   If a large percentage of the population decided not to pay taxes, there would be no workable
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:16.400]   solution for the government authorities to impose their will on the population.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.620]   Best example would be the problem with immigration.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.460]   People can – as far as illegal immigrants in the United States of America, there are
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.260]   millions, tens of millions of illegal immigrants in the United States of America.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:34.580]   But nobody has any possible plan, no possible way to deport systematically all of those
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.540]   illegal immigrants.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.520]   And so we kind of continue in this uncomfortable detente situation where nobody can really
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.420]   do much about it except move a little bit of symbolism and try to get people to make
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.700]   actions on their own.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:55.460]   That's why one of President-elect Trump's ideas that he promotes is – has an intended
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:04.660]   goal of encouraging self-deportation where people voluntarily choose to leave the country.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.460]   So with the tax system here, the tax system functions on the same basis.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.900]   And so the IRS generally doesn't go after low-level tax for much of the time when you
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.140]   get audited or have a problem with the IRS.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.780]   It's relatively low-level.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.060]   Sometimes it's computer-generated inquiry, some simple back and forth.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:30.700]   They don't sue normal people with small incomes for tax fraud.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.540]   They do sue high-profile people they can make an example out of.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.900]   This is a way that you control a population is you make an example out of a few cases.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.980]   This instills fear and respect among the population and most people voluntarily comply.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:51.940]   But the trick is that the Affordable Care Act penalty does not have – that the IRS
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.720]   does not have the same legal authority under today's laws, does not have the same legal
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:02.940]   authority to extract the tax.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.980]   If you don't pay the penalty and if you don't pay it year by year by year by year,
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.980]   let's say you incur a $2,000 penalty and at the end of 10 years, you owe $20,000.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:19.340]   The IRS does not have the legal authority to garnish your wages for the $20,000 or to
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.800]   seize your property to pay the $20,000.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.660]   They have to wait for you to send in a check or if you've made the mistake by sending
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:34.980]   in too much money for tax for other income tax, they can take it from a refund.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:41.620]   If you owe them $20,000 for the health insurance tax penalty and you are owed a refund because
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:47.860]   you had your employer deduct your wages and send that money in or you made quarterly payments
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.380]   for your income tax to the IRS and at the end of the year, you calculate things and
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:58.480]   you're owed a $5,000 refund, the IRS can legally choose to keep that refund and use
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.260]   that to work towards satisfying the $20,000 that you owe them.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:10.260]   But beyond that, I cannot find any evidence that there are any other enforcement mechanisms
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.780]   available to them.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.400]   Now this story and these facts have been very interesting to me since for the last five
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:23.380]   or six years through the whole integration of the legislation.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.700]   Now I didn't have to face that decision myself but I had researched it myself and I couldn't
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.700]   find any offsetting information but I always felt slow to want to talk about that publicly
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:38.500]   because it just seemed so out of character.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.980]   How could I be right about that?
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:45.340]   Here's an article from Kelly Phillips Erb from writing in Forbes magazine, at least
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.700]   the online edition, from February 26, 2015.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.700]   Last month, the Obama administration announced that between three and six million households,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.420]   about two to four percent of taxpayers, would be faced with a penalty at tax time for failing
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:04.500]   to secure minimum essential coverage to comply with the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.020]   to as Obamacare.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.780]   Under Obamacare, you're considered covered if you have insurance through the government,
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.420]   including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, retiree coverage, TRICARE or VA health coverage, private
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.500]   insurance that you purchased on your own, including COBRA coverage, and coverage obtained
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.140]   through the health insurance marketplace or provided by your employer.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.660]   You'll report coverage on your tax return, blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.220]   Most taxpayers, about 130 million or so, will report coverage.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.620]   Of those who don't have coverage, estimates range from 20 million to 37.5 million, most
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.380]   will avoid being subject to the penalty based on a waiver or exemption.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.380]   We'll talk about exemptions in a minute.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.460]   Those taxpayers who can't demonstrate essential minimum coverage and aren't otherwise exempt
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.300]   are subject to a penalty.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.420]   The shared individual responsibility payment equal to one percent of income above the filing
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.860]   threshold or $94.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.860]   These numbers are out of date.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.860]   It goes on.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.260]   So the numbers that I just gave you are current.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:01.820]   In terms of dollars, the Congressional Budget Office had initially estimated that by 2016,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.780]   nearly 6 million taxpayers would be subject to an average penalty of $1,200.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.740]   The overwhelming majority, 80%, of those estimated to be at risk to the penalty were those in
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:20.340]   the middle class with incomes between $55,850 and $115,250.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:24.420]   Since that time, the numbers have been adjusted downward, based largely on the perceived success
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.900]   of policies purchased through the marketplace and the increased number of taxpayers exempt
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.400]   under the rules.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.000]   Those estimates between 3 and 6 million households are still just guesses, but the dollars associated
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.620]   with those numbers are the real mystery.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.840]   You see, buried in the language of the 2010 law creating the Affordable Health Care Act
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.740]   is a bit of an out.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.340]   There are practically no real consequences for not paying the penalty.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.700]   I mentioned this to Maggie McGrath, personal finance reporter for Forbes, while shooting
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.580]   video about the Health Care Act earlier this month.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.140]   Shouldn't that be the real story, she asked?
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.460]   She's right, of course.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.540]   It should, but oddly enough, nobody is really talking about it.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.100]   Why so quiet?
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.140]   Here's my guess.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.220]   Nobody has a clue what's really going to happen.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.240]   You see, when the Act became news in 2010, rumors were flying about what would happen
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.980]   if you didn't pay the penalty.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.260]   It was politically tricky.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.380]   The consequences needed to be enough to make you want to conform with the Act, but not
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.020]   so onerous that Congress would be loathe to vote for it.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.420]   The final language in the Act declared that the penalty "shall be paid upon notice and
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.020]   demand," which sounds really intimidating.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:38.900]   The language went on to note that the penalty would be "collected in the same manner as
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:44.780]   an assessable penalty under Subchapter B of Chapter 68," which also sounds pretty serious,
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.620]   especially since Subchapter B references some pretty nasty penalties for otherwise not complying
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.040]   with other sections of the tax code.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.860]   So what would the penalty for noncompliance be?
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.860]   Jail time?
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   Nope.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.900]   The language in the Act specifically rules out jail time, saying at section 500A(g)(2)(a),
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:06.780]   "In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:13.060]   section, such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.740]   respect to such failure."
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.500]   So no jail time.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.740]   But that means that the IRS will chase you and lean your property if you don't pay,
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.740]   right?
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.020]   That's not allowed under the Act.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.180]   You guys insert my own comments here.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.780]   Remember the famous quote, "We have to pass the bill so that we can read it and find
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.780]   out what's in it"?
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   Here are some of the consequences of that type of approach to lawmaking.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.300]   Nope, that's not allowed under the Act.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:44.660]   At 500A(g)(2)(b)(i), "The Treasury cannot file notice of lien with respect to any property
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:50.420]   of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section."
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.460]   So no liens.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.180]   Then clearly there will be levies or seizures on your wages and account, right?
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.500]   Nope, not that either.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.460]   Under 500A(g)(2)(b)(ii), "The Treasury cannot 'levy' on any such property with
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.580]   respect to such failure."
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.980]   To recap then, by law you have to pay the penalty.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.540]   But if you don't, you won't go to jail, you won't be leaned, and you won't be
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.620]   levied for collection.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.140]   Is there anything that could happen to you if you choose not to pay?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.900]   With no jail, no liens, and no levies, it doesn't leave the IRS a lot of room to
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.780]   work when it comes to collections.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:29.820]   Congress actually managed to create, as I wrote in 2012 and in 2013, "an incredibly
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.340]   complex and burdensome law without any teeth."
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.140]   Well, maybe some teeth, baby teeth.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:42.820]   The IRS might seize any part or all of your refund in order to satisfy your obligation.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.820]   Might.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.780]   IRS hasn't come right out and said that it absolutely will offset your refund if you
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.660]   owe a penalty for failure to pay.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.420]   However, in the final regulations issued on this matter, IRS noted that "Nothing in
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.820]   this section prohibits the Secretary from offsetting any liability for the shared responsibility
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.580]   payment against any overpayment due the taxpayer, in accordance with Section 6402(a) and its
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.660]   corresponding regulations."
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.820]   That's sufficiently passive-aggressive, right?
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.580]   You're on notice that the IRS doesn't think that it's barred from taking your refund.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.140]   They're not saying they will, for certain, but they're not saying they won't either.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.700]   So is there anything you can expect for sure?
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.620]   You can definitely expect a lot of letter-writing and virtual shaking of the government's fist
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.140]   at you, maybe even some blustering for good measure.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.820]   But real consequences?
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.780]   Other than that potential refund seizure and a guilty conscience, there's nothing to keep
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.900]   taxpayers from opting out of paying.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.900]   Will they?
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.860]   We'll have to wait and see.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:47.940]   Plus ends the article on Forbes by Kelly Phillips Erb, who writes on taxes there.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.660]   Interesting, huh?
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:58.080]   My current opinion and understanding is that if you choose not to pay the imposed penalty
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.260]   tax for not having health insurance coverage, there are very few negative repercussions
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.780]   that you can expect under the current law.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.140]   That's the best that I have been able to figure out.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.460]   Now, you should make sure, for your own safety, that you never wind up in a situation where
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.260]   you're expecting a significant refund from the IRS.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.540]   That's a matter of good practice regardless.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.780]   Now, it's not always avoidable, but in general, try to work out your exemptions and your withholdings
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.220]   and your quarterly tax payments and such to the point where you're going to have about
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.100]   a neutral scenario.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:36.100]   You don't want to get a big refund back at tax time, nor do you want to owe a big check.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.700]   If you owe a big check, you could be subject to penalties for underpayment of tax on your
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.540]   quarterly or withholding calculations.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.780]   But if you get a big refund back, you've given up utility of the money and you've given it
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.740]   to the government at a 0% loan and you've subjected yourself to a whole lot of hassle
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.740]   to get it back.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.700]   Now, lots of people do that because they consider that their savings policy.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.780]   Okay, if you want to do it, fine.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.180]   I don't think the IRS is a very good bank.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.980]   It's kind of hard to get money out of them sometimes.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.740]   They have all the legal teeth and you have nothing.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.700]   So in general, you should calculate your taxes as close to zero as you can.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.320]   It's not always possible, but that's the goal.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.140]   I don't think it's a huge concern if you choose not to pay the penalty as long as you avoid
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.140]   that refund situation.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.540]   Now, my concerns, I wouldn't advocate for that.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   My concerns are a fewfold.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.400]   Number one, you still have to face the reality that you don't have any significant health
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.020]   insurance coverage.
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.980]   In general, that's not the best plan.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.940]   In general, it's better to have health insurance coverage.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.680]   That's important.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:45.260]   Number two, the concern with legislation is I don't see any reason why that legislation
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.060]   cannot be changed.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.540]   Legislation can be changed.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.400]   It often is.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:57.820]   So if this were to be a problem, let's pretend that we continued with a president-elect Hillary
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.660]   Clinton in today's world rather than a president-elect Donald Trump.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:07.740]   If there wound up being a tremendously high nonparticipation rate by American citizens
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:13.140]   choosing not to pay the penalty fee, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't change the
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.880]   law and simply give the IRS more teeth.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.900]   Under those circumstances, I think you could change and you could make the argument, "Well,
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.540]   if that happens, I'll go ahead and consider paying the taxes.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.580]   But in the meantime, I've had use of the money.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.580]   I can grant that argument."
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:32.460]   Now, the third thing is everything regarding the Affordable Care Act at this point in time
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:42.620]   is uncertain and due to the election of president-elect Trump who campaigned upon a promise of repealing
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.700]   and later repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act legislation.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:52.700]   This is also interesting to watch given the Republican majority in the House and the Senate
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.300]   because when this legislation was passed, it was purely done on party lines.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.820]   Every Republican voted against it and every – I don't know if all Democrats voted
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.100]   for it but at least all Republicans opposed it.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:09.900]   So given the massive win, the landslide win based upon the Republican political party,
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:15.020]   there is little – I don't see any major political will that the Republicans – any
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.000]   reason for the Republicans not to work towards repealing it.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.900]   The challenge comes from the basis of replacement because there are so many millions of people
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:30.460]   who had pre-existing conditions, who were rightfully cut out of the health insurance
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:40.380]   marketplace that the political bad PR of Republican House, Senate and president saying, "We're
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:45.460]   now going to eject all these people from the health insurance rolls," that bad political
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.540]   press, it's hard for me to imagine them having political will to stand up against
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.540]   that.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.300]   Now, maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.540]   It's hard for me to do that.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:04.120]   Compassion and the goals of compassion seems to be the driving force of our political ideology
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:10.460]   and compassion for the few is of primary importance and I haven't seen any serious proposal
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:15.920]   that to me has made sense that it can work in order to manage the political realities
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.800]   with the financial realities.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   Time will tell.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   We will see.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.060]   We will continue to observe and see what happens and I'm thankful that I don't have that
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.900]   job.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.860]   I would be remiss if I didn't point out that you – even though these technical financial
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.140]   considerations, they're practical but none of them solves the ethical question of whether
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.540]   you should or should not pay the penalty tax.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.940]   And on that, I will leave that to you.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:47.340]   I find that a very difficult question to answer and I will simply say that in a past tax year
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:54.180]   when I owed a penalty due to non-possession of health insurance for myself, I – for
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.340]   a period of time, I chose to pay the penalty.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.940]   You have to make your own decision.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:06.360]   Now, let's talk about some exemptions here because yes, you can choose not to pay the
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:11.500]   penalty and that's quite interesting and somewhat – well, it's provocative and
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   interesting.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.340]   But let's talk about some exemptions because there are other exemptions and I've very
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.820]   rarely heard these exemptions discussed and perhaps you'll find an exemption here that
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.860]   will cover you.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:30.340]   Obviously, the simplest way to avoid paying the penalty tax is by having qualifying minimum
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:37.340]   essential health insurance coverage and the Affordable Care Act has been effective at
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.500]   making that possible for all people.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:46.700]   If you remove the problem of pre-existing conditions, that's what the Affordable Care
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:53.600]   Act did, and if you remove the problem of so-called affordability, which is what the
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.460]   premium tax credit as well as the expansion of Medicaid effectively does for most people,
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:08.720]   there are very few non-ideological reasons to participate in the federal health insurance
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.700]   programs.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:17.620]   So for most people, they can simply avoid the penalty by signing up for insurance and
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:18.980]   that's what most people do.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:26.060]   Now, the challenge here becomes if the pricing changes and that's what has dogged the heels
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.140]   of the Affordable Care Act legislation and it only appears to be getting worse.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:36.460]   Because the market was so fundamentally unstable, it was so financially poorly calculated, then
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.580]   there doesn't seem to be any way that the marketplace can continue based upon the current
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.580]   prices.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:46.060]   Now, that doesn't necessarily reflect, in my opinion, through to the general population
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:52.060]   because most people who are lower and middle income people are receiving that premium,
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.220]   who are not participating at their work, et cetera.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.780]   I'm talking about the people who are enrolled through healthcare.gov.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:02.300]   Because most of these people are receiving the premium tax credit and because their premium
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:08.820]   is calculated based upon affordability, they're not seeing the true cost and the true cost
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.820]   increases.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.200]   It's only the accountants who are seeing that.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:18.340]   So most people are not upset who are on the health, the actual impact of the rising premiums
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.140]   seems to be relatively controlled for most people who are participating in the Affordable
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   Care Act and who are receiving the premium tax credit.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.720]   It's only behind the scenes that the costs are falling apart.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:41.200]   So most people can just simply choose to sign up for and get the Affordable Care Act coverage.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.020]   There are markets where this is changing.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.540]   There are markets where a significant number of insurers are pulling out of the healthcare.gov
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.680]   marketplace.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:55.180]   They are losing money hand over fist and this change of supply is also having some significant
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.180]   impact.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.380]   But you can sign up for insurance and there are lots of reasons.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.620]   There's open enrollment.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.980]   It's available every year.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.180]   Plus there are lots of qualifying life events.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.620]   If you recently get married, if you recently get divorced, if you had the birth of a child,
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.560]   those are ways that you can sign up and get coverage.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.820]   You can also buy qualifying health insurance coverage through your employer.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:22.680]   You can still in theory buy it on the private market or you can qualify for Medicaid if
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.320]   your income fits into the appropriate numbers.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.820]   But the Affordable Care Act legislation does list a couple of important exemptions.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.180]   Let's talk about those so that you know what they are.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:41.660]   The first one which to me is actually one of the more interesting ones is homelessness.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:53.220]   If you qualify as being homeless, you can maintain an exemption from that Obamacare
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.220]   penalty.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.740]   Now, the reason this is interesting to me is my brain works where I generally look for
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.420]   the angles on things.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:05.380]   For example, Medicaid is not based upon – at least in my state and in most states as I
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:10.060]   understand the law – Medicaid is not based upon the number of assets that you have.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.180]   It's based upon the amount of income that you have.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.500]   So there are many of you who are listening to the audience and there are many people
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:21.460]   who I've interviewed and profiled on the show who live on a very small monthly budget
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.420]   when measured by their expenses.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.980]   It doesn't mean that they're broke.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.100]   They just don't have a lot of income.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.780]   This is highly advantageous when it comes to tax planning.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:40.060]   It is absolutely possible that you, if you lived in a paid-for house or had living arrangements
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:43.980]   that didn't require a high amount of monthly rent payments, simplest one would be a paid-for
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.540]   house in an area with low property taxes, etc.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:57.260]   If you had a paid-for house, no debt payments, cars weren't functional but no monthly payments,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:02.820]   you could live a very comfortable lifestyle, especially in our modern economy, on relatively
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:10.900]   little income, which requires you, regardless of the amount of your net worth, to not pull
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.860]   a lot of income off of your portfolio of assets.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.640]   It's very doable.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:24.060]   If you compound that approach, no house payment, minimal property taxes, no significant asset
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:30.260]   payments like car payments, if you compound that with some appropriate investments that
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:36.660]   allow you to shelter some income through depreciation expenses or depletion expenses, and if you
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:42.540]   compound that with having your own business, which allows you to offset any portion of
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:51.340]   your expenses that are due to your business activities, it's very possible that you could
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:58.740]   live a great lifestyle on a relatively low income and be perfectly comfortable.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:06.820]   Well, that relatively low income could, in theory, checking on the numbers in your state,
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:13.180]   allow you to qualify for Medicaid and thus to be exempt from the health insurance coverage,
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:20.380]   excuse me, the penalty taxes, and to get health insurance on the dole without you having to
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.980]   do anything.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.260]   If you were alternatively forced with, let's say, paying expenses of a couple thousand
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:31.820]   dollars a month for health insurance, which would not be unreasonable in some situations,
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.200]   that could be a significant savings.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.500]   That's also available to you through the premium tax credit system.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:45.060]   So we wind up with this very interesting and strange effect of the US tax code where you're
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.780]   penalized for earning a lot of money, but you're not penalized for being rich.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.340]   You're penalized for earning a lot of money.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:57.140]   Well, if that's the way the law is written, then if you can fit your lifestyle expenses
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:02.580]   onto a smaller budget, just earn less money.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:07.020]   So whenever I read a regulation, back to the Power of Choice series that I did in previous
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:11.380]   episodes of the show, whenever I read a regulation, I just want to know, "Okay, what defines that?
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.580]   How do you know that?"
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.900]   And so hardship category number one is actually extremely interesting to me.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.820]   All it says is, "You were homeless."
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:27.780]   So I'm here reading the ... Right in front of me, I have the hardship exemption application
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:34.060]   that would need to be submitted for approval when filing taxes based on the healthcare.gov,
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.540]   and it tells me that I need to submit documentation.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.980]   So let me read this document to you.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.900]   Page three of six of the official document that I found on healthcare.gov while reading
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.100]   about the health coverage exemptions.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.900]   Hardship categories and documentation.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:52.380]   You must provide documentation that one, supports the reason that you're requesting the exemption,
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.220]   and two, includes dates showing when you experienced the hardship.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.620]   So here's hardship number one, category one.
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.500]   You were homeless.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:09.660]   Those are the stated ... That's the state that is being described.
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.660]   You were homeless.
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.980]   You were without a home.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:18.300]   Stated documentation, none.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.340]   So then I go on and I read the application here.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.820]   It says that I need to put in my name, my address, or leave blank if you don't have
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.820]   one.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.580]   I need to put in my city, my phone number, my email address, my preferred spoken language,
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.300]   my preferred written language.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.260]   I need to give them information about my tax household, tell them about the people in my
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.660]   house.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.420]   Now here where I talk about the hardship, I choose option one, homeless.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.980]   The tax year for which I need the exemption, the date the hardship started, and the date
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.140]   the hardship ended.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:49.020]   Check if ongoing.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.140]   Read print, I'm signing the application.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.980]   So basically all it requires me to say is to affirm that I'm homeless.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:01.100]   I find that to be an interesting definition.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:10.860]   But if you were homeless, then you may be eligible for the hardship exemption here to
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.060]   help you avoid paying the Obamacare penalty.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   I don't know what the definition of homeless is and I don't see any guidance in the documents.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.440]   So you'll have to decide if you are homeless or not.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.460]   Number two, hardship category number two, you were evicted or were facing eviction or
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.980]   foreclosure.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:35.340]   Either you would be required to submit documentation of your eviction or of your foreclosure notice
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.100]   within the last three years.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.300]   Now this one was confusing to me because on the application it says that they require
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.900]   documentation of the eviction or foreclosure notice in the last three years.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.820]   But on the instructions, which I also read, it indicates that if you were evicted in the
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.540]   past six months and were facing eviction or foreclosure, then that would be a problem.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:58.580]   I don't think that would be useful for the majority of the listening audience, but you
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.860]   should know that is an exemption.
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.340]   Next one, same category, hardship number three, you received a shutoff notice from a utility
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.340]   company.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.580]   You must submit documentation of a shutoff notice from a utility company which state
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.260]   service has or will be shut off.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.380]   And this must be within the last three years.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.640]   Probably not a factor for most of you.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.660]   Number four, you recently experienced domestic violence.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.340]   Required documentation, none.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:29.660]   Now this is one of those areas where it's not fun to talk about because it affects people
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.740]   so deeply.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:38.300]   And I don't know how they would even indicate this because – or how they would even – I
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.940]   don't know how they would know whether to approve the hardship exemption or anything
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.940]   like this.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:43.780]   What is domestic violence?
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.460]   Now we understand conceptually what that means, but what is it actually?
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:51.180]   What's the definition of domestic violence and how do you demonstrate it?
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.520]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.260]   So I will just simply read it to you and move on.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.300]   Number five, you experienced the death of a close family member within the last three
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.300]   years.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.380]   If that's the case, you may qualify for a hardship exemption.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.940]   Proof of documentation needed, death certificate, death notice from newspaper, funeral service
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:10.820]   program, funeral expenses, coroner's report, military notification of death or other official
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.140]   notice of death.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.540]   That one would just simply be something to be on your radar screen that if you experienced
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.980]   the death of a family member, you should apply for this exemption.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:24.780]   Six, you experienced a fire, flood or other natural or human-caused disaster that caused
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.860]   substantial damage to your property.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:32.240]   Proof of documentation, police or fire report, insurance claim or other document from a government
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:38.100]   agency or news source about the event that occurred within the last three years.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.940]   Category seven, you filed for bankruptcy, must submit official bankruptcy filing documents
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.980]   within the last three years.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:50.420]   Eight, you had medical expenses you couldn't pay.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:54.180]   That's the hardship exemption that you can apply for.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:59.060]   So you must submit medical bills from the last three years.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:08.260]   Nine, category nine, you experienced unexpected increases in necessary expenses due to caring
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:16.580]   for an ill, disabled or aging family member.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:22.100]   Now this one I think has promise for some of you listening who are looking to avoid
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.220]   the exemption, excuse me, avoid the penalty.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:31.180]   Many of us would fall into this situation where we have unexpected increases in necessary
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.620]   expenses due to caring for an ill, disabled or aging family member.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.140]   I don't know what unexpected increases are.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.100]   I do know that most families who are caring for an aging family member find themselves
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.260]   paying much more than they thought.
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.820]   I don't know what necessary expenses are.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:54.160]   There's no further indication of what that is.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.560]   The documentation that you need to submit for this is receipts for bills or services
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.260]   related to care like medical bills, home care services or transportation receipts from the
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.740]   last three years.
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.220]   That's category nine.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:11.740]   Category 10, a child you expect to claim as a tax dependent has been denied coverage in
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:16.420]   Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, and another person is required
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.480]   by court order to give medical support to the child.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.460]   In this case, the court, you have to submit a court order that covers the time period
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:27.900]   for which you want the exemption for the tax dependent and copies of eligibility notices
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.780]   showing the dependent has been denied Medicaid and CHIP coverage, must be within the last
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.780]   three years.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.660]   So this is one should just simply be on your radar screen.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:40.620]   Eleven, as a result of a health insurance marketplace appeals decision, you're eligible
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:45.420]   either for one, enrollment in a qualified health plan through the marketplace, two,
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:49.980]   lower costs on your monthly premiums or three, cost sharing reductions for a time period
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.540]   when you weren't enrolled in a marketplace plan.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.340]   In this case, you must submit documentation of health insurance marketplace notice of
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.060]   appeals decision.
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.740]   The notice must show the names of everyone in your tax household who wants this exemption.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:06.580]   Twelve, an adult in your tax household was determined ineligible for Medicaid because
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:13.940]   your state did not expand eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:19.380]   This is for those of you in states that are required to expand their Medicaid rolls to
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:26.280]   include households who are earning up to 133% of the federal poverty level guidelines.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:33.960]   And so if your state did not do that, then you would qualify for Medicaid, but because
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.920]   your state didn't increase the Medicaid, then you might qualify for the exemption from
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.960]   the penalty.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.660]   Submit notice of denial of eligibility for Medicaid.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.560]   The notice must be from a date during the time period for which you're requesting
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   the exemption.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.520]   Number 13 and number 14 here are our final two.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.000]   You got a notice from a current health insurance plan that you purchased on the individual
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.360]   market, not job-based coverage, saying your policy will be canceled because it doesn't
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:04.720]   meet Affordable Care Act requirements and you consider other available plans unaffordable.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.040]   This one affects probably a lot of people.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   They got a notice.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.560]   Many, many health insurance plans were canceled.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.240]   This was the most frustrating thing when I was doing health insurance was I had prior
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.680]   to 2010, I had sold a number of health insurance policies.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:22.400]   And what I'd like to sell was I didn't do much group insurance, but what I did was
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:28.200]   I just – there were just awesome individual health insurance policies available, cheap,
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.560]   just pure catastrophic coverage, which is my favorite model for health insurance.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.520]   For people who are healthy, it's the best model.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.240]   If you're sick, it's not.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:40.960]   But just pure catastrophic coverage, individual policy, not connected to any work, very high
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.400]   deductible, very, very low premium.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.680]   Well, the vast majority of those were canceled.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.880]   First premiums were raised and then they were just canceled.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.240]   I had many unhappy clients who liked that approach.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.360]   But because of the requirements for minimum essential coverage, all my male clients had
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.760]   to have policies that had coverage for pregnancy and had to cover all this stuff and the premiums
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.260]   went up and the policies were no longer eligible.
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:07.960]   So if you got a notice from a current health insurance plan that you purchased on the individual
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.880]   market, not job-based coverage, saying that your policy will be canceled because it doesn't
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:18.840]   meet Affordable Care Act requirements and if you consider other available plans unaffordable,
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:25.160]   you qualify for an exemption from the penalty tax.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.280]   You must submit documentation which contains a notice of a cancellation from the insurance
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:33.020]   company and the notice must show the names of everyone in your tax household who wants
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.440]   this exemption.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:39.760]   Finally, number 14, you can apply for an exemption if you experienced a hardship that kept you
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:44.840]   from getting health insurance that's not listed in the previous 13 categories.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.400]   If so, you would take that on an ad hoc basis.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.720]   Those are the hardship exemptions.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:57.800]   And by the way, the process for these is that you submit an application to the healthcare
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.080]   administration, they send you back a letter, notice of approval, something like that, and
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.800]   they give you an exemption certificate number if you qualify and that's the exemption certificate
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.040]   number that you would list on your tax return.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.540]   So there is a process of submitting an application and then receiving approval or request for
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.800]   additional information, etc. from them.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.000]   But those are the hardship exemptions.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.300]   Now there are other exemptions which you also need to be aware of.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.480]   Those are only simply the hardship exemptions.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:27.920]   But it's good for you to have those on your mental radar screen.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.360]   I hate to overuse the cliche but just to be aware of them so that if you or a friend is
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:39.820]   in that situation that you know of them so that you can avoid paying that penalty which
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.120]   could be substantial for some people.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.640]   Because oftentimes what happens, here's why this is so important, why I labored through
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.100]   all 14 of those categories.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:55.520]   Many times people don't have health insurance because their life is in turmoil.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:01.080]   They've gone through the death of a family member, they've had a serious illness, they've
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:04.700]   lost their job, they've been evicted or foreclosed, etc.
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:10.220]   These are the circumstances in which people often wind up just everything falling apart
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:13.600]   and they focus on survival as they should.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.620]   So focus on paying for food and putting gas in the car so they can go to a job interview,
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.620]   etc.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.520]   Things like health insurance fall behind.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.920]   But they often don't go through and try to apply for all of the situations or maybe it's
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:31.620]   not open enrollment period and thus they're not eligible to apply for coverage through
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.000]   healthcare.gov or they just don't get around to it.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.860]   Well, if you're aware of these hardship exemptions, you may be able to help somebody save a significant
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.580]   amount of money when it comes time to filing their taxes.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:42.700]   So you should be aware of them.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.340]   Let's talk about some of the other exemptions because some of these other ones are important.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.280]   There are some income exemptions.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:52.380]   I already mentioned earlier that if you don't have to file a tax return because your income
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:58.460]   is below the level that requires you to file, which that number again is about 10 grand
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.420]   for an individual, 20 grand for a couple.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:07.080]   If you're below that level, then you automatically aren't going to be paying the penalty tax.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.100]   So if your income is below the amount requiring you to file a tax return, you are going to
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.500]   be exempt based upon income.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.020]   Also the other income related exemption is this.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:23.940]   You'll be exempt from the penalty tax if the lowest price coverage available to you through
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:36.260]   either a marketplace or job-based plan would cost more than 8.13% of your household income.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:41.260]   So if you're being offered coverage but it's just a much higher percentage than either
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:46.820]   through your job or through a marketplace, then you could qualify for the income related
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820]   exemption.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.100]   There are a couple of coverage related exemptions.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.180]   I read the one that talked about if your state didn't expand its Medicaid program.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.060]   Also I mentioned earlier, if you were uninsured for no more than two consecutive months of
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:05.020]   the year, then you would be exempt from the penalty tax.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:10.140]   There are some group membership exemptions and here are some of the more interesting
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.140]   ones.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.620]   One, if you're a member of a federally recognized tribe or eligible for services through an
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:29.220]   Indian health services provider, you are exempt from the Affordable Care Act tax penalties.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:35.020]   A federally recognized tribe is any Indian or Alaska native tribe or Alaska native claim
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:41.240]   settlement act, corporation, regional or village, band, nation, Pueblo, village, rancheria or
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.380]   community that the Department of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:52.100]   If you're a member of an Indian tribe or eligible for services through an Indian health services
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:57.720]   provider, you can be exempt from the penalty tax.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.120]   Also the next one is if you are a member of a recognized healthcare sharing ministry.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.120]   That's the next episode.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.920]   We'll talk about those in detail.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.900]   But if you are a member of a recognized healthcare sharing ministry, you can be exempt from the
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.900]   penalty tax.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.760]   This is what I do.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:19.020]   Also if you are a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance,
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:25.340]   including social security and Medicare, then you can be eligible for an exemption from
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.300]   the Affordable Care Act tax penalty.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:34.100]   Now this is a category that should be very inclusive of many people, but unfortunately
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.180]   due to people bowing down and rolling over to get as much money from the government as
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.740]   possible, this is very, very limited.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.780]   Basically just think of the Amish.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.460]   There are a couple of other small religious sects that qualify.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:51.080]   But in order to claim this exemption, you have to be a member of a religious sect or
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.520]   division that is recognized by the Social Security Administration as conscientiously
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:02.420]   opposed to accepting any insurance benefits, including social security and Medicare, and
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:07.540]   that must have been in existence since December 31, 1950.
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:11.300]   Unfortunately for most of us, our forebears rolled over when they shouldn't have, and
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.320]   that will not apply to most of us.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.140]   Next exemption is if you're incarcerated, then you are exempt from the Affordable Care
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.180]   Act tax penalty.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:27.520]   And finally, if you are a US citizen living abroad, a certain type of non-citizen or not
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:38.620]   lawfully present in the United States, then you can qualify as being exempt from the Affordable
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.220]   Care Act tax penalty.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.500]   The term lawfully present includes immigrants who have "qualified non-citizen immigration
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:49.300]   status without a waiting period, humanitarian statuses or circumstances, or valid non-immigrant
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.300]   visas, etc."
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.580]   Now, of course, the one that's interesting that you should also pay attention is the
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.220]   US citizen abroad exemption.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:01.200]   If you're a US citizen living abroad, and here are the definitions of that, because
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.180]   for those of you in the perpetual travel world, etc., you should pay attention to this.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:12.420]   That means that you are a US citizen who either spent at least 330 full days outside of the
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:17.860]   United States during a 12-month period, or was a bona fide resident of a foreign country
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.380]   or countries for a full tax year.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:26.700]   Or it means that you're a resident alien who both was a citizen of a national – citizen
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.500]   or national of a foreign country with which the US has an income tax treaty with a non-discrimination
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:36.260]   clause and you were a resident alien who was a bona fide resident of a foreign country
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:41.900]   for the tax year, or if you're not lawfully present in the United States.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.140]   And then those are – so that's a key factor.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.820]   For those of you who are into the world of perpetual travel or who live outside of the
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:54.020]   United States, one major thing that that can be compelling in your tax planning is not
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.540]   only will you most likely have significant lower health insurance costs depending on
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.020]   the country or the region that you're in, depending on how that's structured, but you
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:13.100]   will at least be eligible for this exemption from the US tax penalty.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.460]   So if you've made it this far, congratulations.
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:21.460]   We've worked through that to go through all of those different categories and I congratulate
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.980]   you on having the focus to be able to be here an hour and five minutes later where we've
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:26.980]   gone through those details.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   But those are the details of exemption from the penalty.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.260]   Now that penalty used to be insignificant.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.540]   Here's why I focus on the show.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.660]   Number one, the information needs to be out there and I'm not aware of it out there
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.900]   in a podcast format.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.340]   But the penalty used to be insignificant.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.540]   Today that penalty is significant.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.780]   It can be many thousands of dollars.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.980]   And so you need to know about these exemptions.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:54.180]   There are a few of these exemptions that will probably be of particular interest to the
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.180]   listening audience.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:01.540]   For example, as I said, the US citizen abroad exemption or perhaps that homelessness exemption
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:06.540]   or perhaps that care of an aging relative exemption, some of the income-based exemptions.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.580]   These will be of interest to you.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:14.260]   So in summary, some of your strategies to be able to avoid the Affordable Care Act penalty
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:19.540]   tax, which is the focus and the title of today's show, are these.
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.580]   Of course, number one, just simply get health insurance.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.580]   A couple of ways to do that.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:32.180]   Remember, the premium tax credit is substantial and it substantially offsets the price of
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.860]   the health insurance.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:38.940]   And under the current law, any person who wants to can go and sign up for health insurance
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:45.140]   coverage under the Affordable Care Act system of health insurance exchanges at healthcare.gov
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.100]   or write an open enrollment for that.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.980]   On the healthcare.gov website, you will submit your application, put in your information
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.240]   for your income, et cetera, and they'll tell you what your monthly premium would be.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.740]   And for most people, it's relatively low.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.940]   If you would like to increase your subsidies, then simply reduce your income.
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:06.340]   And those subsidies will go up as your income goes down.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:11.060]   You're incentivized to earn less money in order to have the government pay more of your
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.980]   health insurance costs.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:16.900]   You can get that down if you can get down below that federal poverty level and still
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.620]   be able to live somehow.
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:22.500]   You can get that down to the point where you'll qualify for Medicaid independent of the amount
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:26.260]   of assets that you have.
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:31.220]   So there is very little cost to health insurance for people who have a low income.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:36.740]   If you have a medium to high income, then of course that cost will be more significant.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:41.020]   But if you have a medium to high income, then there are very few reasons not to engage in
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.700]   proactive planning regarding your health insurance coverage.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.260]   It is important.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.840]   It's important financial protection.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.180]   It's important coverage to protect you from the risk of catastrophic health expenses.
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.620]   Now if you choose not to maintain health insurance coverage, then you can just simply pay the
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.180]   penalty.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:03.100]   And depending on those calculations that we did, it may or may not be high.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:08.220]   Or you can do as I explained and simply choose not to maintain health insurance coverage,
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:13.060]   not to qualify for an exemption, and just don't pay the penalty.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:17.300]   That is a perfectly reasonable strategy if that fits the details of your circumstance.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.580]   And under the current law, there are very few if any teeth that the IRS has to get the
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.380]   money out of you.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.940]   So you can choose to keep it.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.980]   Just simply don't pay the penalty.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:41.220]   If you pursue this route, the route of not maintaining health insurance coverage, remember
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:46.980]   that there are some other alternative ways that you can adjust your health, your insurance
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.300]   expenses so that they'll support you in that decision.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:55.900]   So the simplest, most obvious example is if you are not going to maintain health insurance
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:01.060]   coverage, you should focus highly on being as healthy as possible.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:10.260]   So perhaps you should allocate a higher percentage of your budget to higher quality food or to
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:14.100]   a more appropriate exercise regime that's going to allow you to maintain a higher degree
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:19.980]   of health or to proactive medical care that you are preventive medical care to help you
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:25.140]   maintain your good health and lessen the risk of catastrophic health expenses.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:29.300]   You can also adjust some of your other insurance programs.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:33.180]   Something as simple as disability insurance can be very helpful.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:38.180]   Long-term care insurance perhaps can be a way of offsetting the health insurance risks.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:44.060]   These do not cover all your health expenses, but they can be helpful.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:48.340]   Investigate a strategy such as this, increasing the liability insurance coverage on your property
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:53.620]   coverages, liability insurance coverage for your house and for your car.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:59.300]   If you have higher amounts of coverage for medical expenses on your car insurance, if
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.020]   you think that it's most likely that you're going to get injured in an accident, let's
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.620]   say that you're young and you're healthy and you say, "Hey, if I got injured, I'd probably
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.100]   be injured in a car accident."
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:13.740]   Well, then consider increasing your medical coverage cost on your car insurance.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:18.140]   That may be significantly cheaper than having health insurance and if your calculation is
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.180]   correct it might cover you for your situation.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.540]   Or perhaps you engage in some sort of motorsports activity.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:30.060]   Well, can you make sure that you have medical coverage on your liability coverage that has
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.580]   a rider on it covering your participation in that motorsports activity such as your
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.180]   four-wheeler or other things that are associated with your house or your RV coverage or whatever
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.180]   it is.
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:44.580]   Read your liability and property insurance documents carefully and see if you can expand
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:49.540]   some coverage there and perhaps that will protect you from the risk of accidents.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:54.000]   You should also obviously pursue ways to reduce costs such as understanding medical tourism
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.420]   and looking for other strategies or if you just need to just consider going and getting
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.740]   a job that you take and keep purely for the health insurance coverage.
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:07.160]   So there are many, many options and I hope some of these will spark some creative ideas
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   for you.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.460]   My favorite options are health savings accounts which, excuse me, before I get to my favorite
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:18.460]   one, the challenge with this show is that we are in a bit of legislative limbo and so
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.980]   time will tell what happens and it'll be interesting to watch.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.140]   I hope this information is current for a while.
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:28.380]   Now a couple of options that have been my favorites in the past to put as much of – to
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:33.820]   just simply use insurance as a catastrophic protection and put as much of the normal day-to-day
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.940]   cost as coming out of your checking account as possible.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:40.020]   That's why we'll talk in detail about health savings accounts.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:45.260]   I think they were fantastic inventions a number of years ago and we'll see what happens
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.260]   with them in the future.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.360]   And also we'll talk about healthcare sharing ministries because I believe that if you meet
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.660]   the qualifications of participation in a healthcare sharing ministry, then I believe that will
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:59.700]   be a useful option for you.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.980]   And my intention is that that will be the very next podcast for you.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.620]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:09.580]   If this information has been helpful to you, I would ask you humbly to – I would ask
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.220]   you for your financial support.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.620]   Please consider becoming a patron of the show.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.060]   The reason that's important is it helps me to bring you the content that I bring you
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:24.900]   with the regularity that I bring it to you and to do so free of commercial encumbrance,
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.940]   to do so free of many entanglements and having divided interests.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:35.140]   My goal is to serve you, my listening audience, and I've sought to set myself up in a way
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:41.060]   where the incentives, my financial incentives for this show are aligned with your best interests.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:48.100]   But that only works if you voluntarily choose to support me financially.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.780]   One good way to do this is become a patron of the show.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.420]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   Sign up to become a supporting patron of the show.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.300]   It can be as little as a buck a month.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:02.340]   If every listener of the show supported the show at a buck a month, that would be – I
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:09.020]   would limit almost any other commercial thing and I would just focus on you guys every day
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.380]   and I would continue growing it.
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.460]   Now I don't expect that to happen.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:18.900]   Basically it winds up that about 2% of the listening audience signs up to support a show,
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.300]   maybe even less at this point in time.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.140]   But I ask you, consider becoming a patron at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron or if
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:30.100]   you'd like to get my personalized advice on your situation, including topics such as
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.100]   these, these are the kind of thing that I talk about in consulting calls where I can
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.340]   explain to you the exemptions and explain to you your options.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:39.820]   If you say something like, "Hey, Joshua, I don't have health insurance.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.820]   I don't sell insurance.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.260]   I can't make recommendations because I no longer maintain an insurance license.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.540]   I can't make recommendations on your buying or not buying insurance."
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.980]   But I can say, "If you don't have insurance, then you should consider strategies like I
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:55.820]   said such as adjusting your liability coverage on your car to make sure that it's covering
