[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   There's an old saying in Washington that the worst ideas are bipartisan.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.240]   This bill doesn't just ban or force the divestiture of TikTok.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.420]   It goes after what it calls foreign adversary-controlled applications.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.980]   Then you get to the provision that I think is the most problematic, which is a person
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.380]   subject to the direction or control of a foreign person or entity.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.220]   The novel language here is where it says subject to the direction of.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.600]   In my view, that's very vague.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.040]   A creative attorney general could try to say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.360]   If Elon has a major Tesla factory in Shanghai, is he subject to the direction of the Chinese
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360]   Communist Party?"
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.160]   Because they could influence him, they could leverage him.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.360]   If Donald Trump is accused on virtually a daily basis of being a Russian asset, is he
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.000]   subject to the direction of Vladimir Putin?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.320]   I don't know how anyone can look at this language and not say it's too vague.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.200]   The bill poses a significant risk of being Patriot Act 2.0.
