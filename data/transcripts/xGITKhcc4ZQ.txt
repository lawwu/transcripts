[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   >> Welcome, everyone, to the third episode of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.960]   In this episode, we'll be speaking with Jonathan Clements, founder and editor of Humble Dollar.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   He's also the author of several investing books and a former Wall Street Journal personal
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.800]   financial columnist.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.880]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.460]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.400]   This program is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, a
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400]   501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.480]   Today, my special guest is Jonathan Clements, the founder and editor of Humble Dollar.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.320]   He's also the author of eight personal finance books, including "How to Think About Money"
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.440]   and his newest book, "From Here to Financial Happiness."
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.440]   Jonathan also sits on the advisory board and investment committee of Creative Planning,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.600]   one of the country's largest independent financial advisors.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.760]   Jonathan was born in London, England and graduated from Cambridge University before coming to
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.520]   New York in 1986.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.680]   His first job was covering mutual funds for Forbes magazine, and then he went to work
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.920]   for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.760]   He worked at the Journal for almost 20 years, wrote over 1,000 columns for the Journal and
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.960]   the Wall Street Journal Sunday edition.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.440]   He also worked for six years at Citigroup, where he was the director of financial education
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.680]   for city personal wealth management, before returning to the Journal for an additional
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.960]   15-month stint as a columnist.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.480]   Today, I'll be talking with Jonathan about his career and his new book, "From Here to
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.880]   Financial Happiness," plus a lot of other interesting topics that we'll get into right
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.760]   now.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.120]   Let me introduce Jonathan Clements.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Welcome Jonathan.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.240]   Rick, thanks so much for having me on your show.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.640]   I really appreciate it.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.080]   Jonathan, you've got an interesting background.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.120]   You've worked at some of the big financial media companies, including Forbes and the
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.700]   Wall Street Journal for 20 years.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.280]   It didn't take you long, it doesn't seem, that you immediately started looking at what
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.240]   makes performance of mutual funds tick and what makes the performance of accounts tick.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.960]   It seemed like you caught on right away in your writing to this idea that the bogleheads
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.820]   believe in low fees and indexing.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.360]   Can you talk about when you first started as a financial writer, what that process was
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.240]   that got you to that point so quickly?
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.640]   As you can probably tell from the funny accent, Rick, I wasn't born in the U.S., I was born
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.520]   in England, and I had most of my education there, and when I got out of university, I
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.720]   started working in the U.K., and I very quickly discovered that the standard of living for
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.840]   financial journalists, particularly young financial journalists in London, totally sucked.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   And so I decided that I wanted an upgrade, so I moved to New York, and I got a job as
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.600]   a fact-checker at Forbes magazine, which was the lowest form of life.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.480]   And the goal of the fact-checker was to get yourself promoted, and the way I got myself
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   promoted was to start writing about mutual funds, and after almost two years at Forbes,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   I was promoted to a staff writer and given the job of writing for every issue about mutual
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.840]   funds.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.160]   And the standard way at Forbes to write about funds was to do these fund manager profiles.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.640]   Fly to Boston, fly out to Los Angeles, sit down with a money manager, have him or her
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.320]   describe their investment philosophy, and usually they'd give you three or four or five
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.040]   stock picks that you would describe in that particular article.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.960]   And what quickly became apparent to me was that, you know, most of these guys who I considered
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.640]   to be top fund managers, because that's why I was interviewing them, more often than not,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.600]   their moment of glory faded.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.880]   The past performance was definitely no guide to future results.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.600]   I got hired away by the Wall Street Journal in early 1990 to write about mutual funds
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.200]   for them, and I continue to see the same phenomenon.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.800]   So you went there and you actually met with these top money managers, these top mutual
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   fund managers, and you were looking at the performance and having this discussion, and
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.880]   you were realizing then, very soon after that, that it was then their performance started
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.760]   to go down.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.400]   You said their glory faded.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.720]   In the years afterwards, these fund managers who had been at the top of their game when
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.440]   I spoke to them, often the reason I was interviewing them was because they had been identified
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.840]   as being top managers and what was called the Forbes Honor Roll, you know, they had
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.720]   good performance in up markets and down markets, they seemed like consistent winners.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.200]   More often than not, you know, that hot performance didn't last, and we know that, right?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.420]   We know past performance is no guide to future results, and so the question arises, well,
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.160]   what is a guide to future results?
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.800]   And the research has clearly shown, the best predictor of future performance isn't past
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.400]   performance, the best predictor of future performance is low cost.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   If you want a manager who's really brilliant, you want to find the manager who is smart
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   enough to get hired by a fund company with low annual expenses, because that's what's
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.960]   going to give them a performance edge.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   I want to go back though to that one point about their glory faded.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.740]   So you're seeing this time and time again where the glory faded of the top managers
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.320]   that you went out to interview.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.600]   You must, at some point in your mind, did you come up with reasons why the glory faded?
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:21.180]   I mean, what was it that you found that caused the outperforming managers to underperform
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.180]   going forward?
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.680]   Was there something about just the dynamics of the mutual fund industry as a whole?
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.440]   Well, I think a couple of things go on.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.720]   Obviously, we have this issue with successful managers tend to attract assets, and the more
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.560]   assets a manager is overseeing, the harder it is for him or her to continue the good
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   performance.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.400]   But also, the reason that managers tend to stand out is because they are, in a sense,
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.680]   cheating within their style box.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.080]   If you have a good period for growth stocks, the value managers that look good are those
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.680]   who sneak a few growth stocks into their portfolio.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.720]   So you have this value manager that's done well in a period for growth stocks.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.080]   You say, "Okay, this is a guy who really knows his stuff.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.280]   He's been able to pick superior stocks and shine in a period when his investment style
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   is out of favor."
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.240]   But of course, what happens when styles rotate and when value stocks come into favor, the
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.080]   guy who's been cheating, who's been sneaking some growth stocks into his portfolio suddenly
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   finds it hard to keep up with the other value managers because he's not a true value investor.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.080]   I saw that repeatedly in the managers that I looked at.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.120]   I'd be trying to benchmark funds and compare them to their peers, and a particular fund
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.440]   would look good even if his or her style was out of favor.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.080]   But then when the style returned to favor, they were out of step because they owned the
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.440]   wrong sort of portfolios.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.000]   I think a lot of that cheating goes on, and that's a lot of the reason why we think managers
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.880]   are good, and it just turns out they weren't true to their mandate.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.960]   So at some point, you came to the epiphany or the "aha" moment that, "Gee, maybe forget
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.840]   about active management and we're just going to use index funds."
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   When did that occur?
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.360]   It would have been in the early 1990s.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.480]   At that point, there weren't a whole lot of index funds out there, but those that were
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:27.360]   out there were regularly performing better than the typical actively managed fund that
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   they were competing against.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.320]   It wasn't just that I started writing about this stuff, it was also that I started investing
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.080]   my money in these funds.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:43.280]   I became a big believer in indexing, particularly in index funds that were offered by Vanguard.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.960]   The good performance of those funds, coupled with me personally benefiting, was what helped
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.600]   to cement my view that purchasing actively managed funds and trying to actively manage
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.560]   a portfolio is really a fool's errand.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:01.120]   In the early '90s, you went to the Wall Street Journal and you picked up the "Getting Going"
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120]   column.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.840]   In 1994, the Wall Street Journal, which at the time had no columnists outside of the
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.200]   editorial page, the managing editor announced that he was willing to experiment with columns
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:24.480]   within the news pages, and being an uppity 31-year-old, raised my hand and said, "A column,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.840]   I'd like to have one of those."
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.080]   Shockingly, really, the journal gave me a column at H31, so in 1994, towards the end
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.640]   of the year, I started writing this column that was dubbed "Getting Going," and I did
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:44.000]   it for another 13 and a half years, writing that column both for the regular Wall Street
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.320]   Journal and also once it was launched for Wall Street Journal Sunday.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.000]   >>STEVE: The first time you actually wrote about index funds in the "Getting Going" column,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.720]   do you remember approximately what year that was?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.440]   >>RICK: It was part of the "Getting Going" philosophy from the start.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.880]   I would have been writing about index funds even before the "Getting Going" column was
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.240]   launched in 1994, but precisely when, I couldn't tell you, Rick.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.320]   >>STEVE: Did you get any blowback from the journal?
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.200]   Because after all, there's a lot of advertisers in the journal, I mean, these mutual fund
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.520]   companies advertise in the Wall Street Journal, and when you start talking about indexing
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   and low fees and how that is the reason why index funds outperform most active managers,
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.760]   and you started talking about active managers, did you get a talking-to by anyone, or were
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.680]   you allowed to pretty much say what you wanted?
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.560]   >>RICK: I got to tell you, Rick, back in the 1990s, and indeed throughout my period of
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.120]   the journal, from a point of view of advertisers being allowed to influence the copy that appeared
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.520]   in the newspages, it was verboten.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:57.040]   In fact, advertising reps for the Wall Street Journal could be fired for calling up a reporter.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.840]   On a few occasions, I was called by one of the advertising guys and asked to speak at
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.880]   some particular event, and whenever they called, they only called after they'd cleared with
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.800]   their boss, and they called very tentatively.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.520]   It was really, it was a magnificent organization from that point of view.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.080]   I can't swear that it's like that today, but back then, there was a church and state separation
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.760]   between the news department and the advertising department.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.280]   >>STEVE: But I know that I've spoken with a lot of other journalists over my time, and
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.920]   it's not that way at a lot of publications.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.080]   That Chinese wall, if you will, has got a lot of holes in it at a lot of companies.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.280]   >>RICK: Yeah, I can believe that, and there were occasions when executives would come
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.360]   in and complain about my coverage.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:49.280]   I remember one particular meeting, there were some guy who came in from Merrill Lynch to
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:59.480]   complain about my commentary on actually managed funds, and there was a big meeting in the
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.540]   main news conference room on the ninth floor of the journal building, and I was down there,
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.600]   and some other people were down there, and the managing editor was down there.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.680]   The guy from Merrill Lynch spoke his piece, and then I responded, and as we walked out
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.120]   after the meeting, the managing editor sidled up to me, and he whispered in my ear, "He
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.560]   didn't lay a punch on you."
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.760]   That was pretty much the attitude of the journal.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.880]   They were going to, unless you were making factual errors, they were going to defend
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.080]   you to the hilt, but again, I can't swear that it's that way today.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   >>STEVE: I understand.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   Thank you.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.800]   It wasn't only mutual funds, the way I met you, where you were taking investment advisors
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:45.160]   to task as well, and that's how you and I first talked, I think it was in 2001, because
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:51.500]   I had started the company and I was charging low advisory fees, and I think you were really
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:58.800]   onto this idea of what is that 1% AUM fee buying you, and she caught onto that very
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   quickly as well.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:06.320]   >>GREGORY: Well, generally, I would say that the world of investing has become much friendlier
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.800]   to the average investor over the course of my career.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   You think about all the things that have happened.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.000]   We've seen the collapse of brokerage commissions.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.560]   We've seen tighter bid-ask spreads.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:27.240]   We've seen this proliferation of low-cost index funds, and we've seen a total change
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.800]   in the advisory model so that while there are still financial advisors out there who
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.920]   are charging 1% and simply giving you a bunch of expensive mutual funds, that is less and
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   less the case.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   If people are paying 1%, they're often getting a very low-cost portfolio, and they're getting
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.200]   help with their broader financial life, so they're getting help not just with the choice
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.920]   of stocks and bonds and which particular funds they're going to buy and so on, but they're
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.160]   also getting help with a financial plan, they're getting help with their estate plan, help
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.920]   with tax management, help with insurance.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:07.280]   Today, for that 1%, if you're with the right fee-only financial advisor, you're getting
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.320]   much more than you would have got 20 years ago, and of course, as we know, if all you
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.240]   want is portfolio management, you can go out and you can get portfolio management for 25
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.480]   basis points these days, and you'll get a portfolio for that 25 basis points that is
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.960]   as good as the portfolio you would have got 20 years ago, probably better, in fact, and
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.560]   be paying 1% back then.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.840]   >> And there are a lot of other models that have come out, too, like flat-fee portfolio
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:43.640]   models, subscription-based organizations like XY Planning, and then hourly-fee advisors
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.480]   as well, so it seems like it's a much more diverse way in which you can pay for this
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.000]   advice rather than just AUM.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.920]   And I think one of the benefits of this is that, you know, you go back 20 years, and
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.240]   people really believe that, you know, if you went to Merrill Lynch, if you went to Morgan
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.360]   Stanley, you were somehow investing with the best and the brightest.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.560]   I think the message has got through that going to the big wirehouses, these big brokerage
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.400]   firms, is actually bad for your financial health, and you're far better off, you know,
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.120]   looking elsewhere to some of these smaller financial planning outfits, looking to the
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:29.360]   robo-advisors, trying out an hourly planner, and the stranglehold that the big brokerage
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:37.680]   firms had on the way, you know, advised clients manage their money is over.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.280]   And that is definitely a plus.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.760]   >> So let's talk about the brokerage firms and such, because both of us worked for Citigroup
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.080]   for a while.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.160]   You changed jobs, and you actually went over to what I call the dark side.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.080]   I was on the dark side, so I'm just saying that facetiously.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.280]   You went to work for Citigroup, and it almost at the time when you did that, there was some
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.120]   of us who had been following you were kind of questioning, scratching our heads, saying
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.760]   you wrote about these companies for years, and now you're going to work for one.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.320]   I mean, was that an experiment, or could you tell us about that?
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.320]   >> Sure.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.440]   Well, back in 2008, I was pretty burned out on writing the column.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:24.040]   I'd been doing it for 13 and a half years, and I was casting around for something new
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.400]   to do.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.000]   And I didn't want to become an editor of the journal.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.760]   I didn't really want to start writing about something else, so I wanted a total change.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.120]   And I was approached by Citigroup to be involved in a financial startup that they were working
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   on.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   And the financial startup was this.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.480]   Their plan was to create an advisory service to everyday Americans that would deliver financial
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.400]   advice in return for a flat monthly fee.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:00.000]   And so I joined Citi in April of 2008, and that's indeed what we worked on.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.240]   We were working on this flat fee advisory program.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.200]   We actually launched a pilot version of it in January 2009.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:19.800]   If you remember what things were like in January 2009, there was a worse time to launch a new
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.600]   financial advisory service.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.840]   I'm not sure when it would have been.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.920]   I mean, January 2009 probably wasn't quite as bad as 1932, but we were at the height
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.400]   of the financial crisis, and this thing went nowhere.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.880]   In the months that followed, Citigroup was in turmoil.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.600]   Smith Barney was sold off.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:44.760]   This startup I was working on fell apart, and Citigroup had to make a call.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.520]   They needed some sort of advisory offering for regular retail investors.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.400]   With Smith Barney gone, what they decided was they were going to take this startup that
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.080]   I was involved in at the time, which was called MyFi, and then what was left, which was the
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:08.360]   bank-based brokers, they threw us together and said, "Figure out what you want to do."
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   They brought in a woman called Debbie McQuitty, who had been at Schwab and had overseen their
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:19.760]   RIA business, and Debbie announced that what she wanted was all these bank-based brokers
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:27.360]   to become the only financial advisors, and this innovative group of people who were part
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.400]   of this startup were put in charge of this group of bank-based brokers, and as you might
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.320]   imagine, it was complete turmoil.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.040]   That is indeed what happened, and that's how I ended up going from being part of this startup
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.160]   to being, as I like to put it, in the mainstream of Citibank.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.320]   I stayed on because they were having this experiment trying to turn these bank-based
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:01.160]   brokers into the only financial advisors, and it worked to a degree, but just purely
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.480]   from an economics point of view, and you'll probably appreciate this, Rick, to go from
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.800]   charging commissions every time you buy and sell, you might be getting a 4% or 5% commission
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.080]   on a product sale, to charging 1% a year, what you effectively do is you give up right
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:24.560]   away three-quarters of your annual revenue, and so this business went from being profitable
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.000]   to being extremely unprofitable, so after a year or so of this, there was yet another
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.320]   U-turn, and they moved towards a fee-commissioned model, but they still continued to try to
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.080]   favor the fee-based business, so I hung on there.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.200]   I actually ended up spending six years at Citigroup.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.360]   Towards the end, I had got to the point where I had enough money that I didn't, the salary
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.520]   I was earning there, and I decided I was sick of dealing with lawyers and sick of dealing
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.040]   with compliance people, so I quit.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.160]   And you went back to the Wall Street Journal for a little while.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.800]   I went back to the Wall Street Journal, and I have to say, even though I can't claim that
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.520]   I didn't much good when I was on the dark side, I'm sort of glad I did it.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:21.120]   I learned a lot about the business that I never would have learned purely being on the
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.120]   outside.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:29.520]   I mean, as you know yourself, Rick, once you've been on the inside, you see how it works.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:36.640]   You understand much better the culture of these institutions and why they do the screwed-up
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   things that they do.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.280]   >>Corey: For the benefit of the shareholders.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:46.400]   >>Steven: Whatever it is, it isn't for the benefit of the everyday investor who walks
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   into the bank branch.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.000]   >>Corey: No, not for that.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I haven't heard that one yet, but that's what they might say to me, but that's not what
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I saw.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.600]   Anyway, so you went to the Wall Street Journal, and you were there for about a year and a
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:06.560]   half, and then you decided to go out on your own and start your own business, the Humble
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:14.480]   Dollar, in 2017, which is a great blog and a lot of good advice there.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.600]   You continue to author books.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:24.000]   In fact, you wrote How to Think About Money, and also your latest book, From Here to Financial
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Happiness.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.400]   Can you talk about the transition to starting your own business and going from a paycheck,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.920]   if you will, to starting from scratch and seeing how it goes?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.080]   >>Steven: I wouldn't claim that I'm the most courageous person in the world, at least not
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.640]   courageous financially, so I wouldn't have ended up in the position I am now if I depended
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.720]   on the income I earned today in order to cover the bills.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.480]   Essentially, this is my retirement job.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.960]   It just happens that I'm working harder than ever.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.920]   >>Corey: I know how that goes.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:05.880]   >>Steven: If the books don't sell and the website doesn't make any money, it's okay.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.200]   Nobody's going to starve tonight.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.400]   I do this more than anything at this point.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.200]   I have a sense of public service.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.960]   I know this stuff backwards and forwards.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.280]   I love writing about it, and I love being part of the conversation.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.080]   That's what the books and the website allow me to do.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.880]   >>Corey: Well, I read From Here to Financial Happiness recently.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.920]   Thank you for sending me the copy.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.920]   I appreciate that.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.160]   In typical Boglehead fashion, if I can get a free book, of course I'll get one for free,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.560]   and I did here, so thank you.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:45.120]   I started reading the book a few weeks ago.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:51.880]   The subtitle is Enrich Your Life in Just 77 Days.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.440]   It occurred to me as I was reading the book.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.120]   I need much longer than 77 days to enrich my life.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.040]   The book is only ... Let me see how many pages it is.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.560]   It's got 77 chapters.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:18.000]   It's 240 pages roughly, but as I began to work through the book, and it's not just a
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   book.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.320]   It's a workbook and a book.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:30.440]   Reading day one, day two, day three, day four, there are some of these days where I was reading
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.160]   about where, my God, I had to put the book down.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.200]   I literally had to say, "I really have to think about that.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.480]   That's going to take a long time for me to process what you just wrote."
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:50.080]   Now, some of the days went by pretty easy, but some of them were much more difficult.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.840]   In fact, I found it aggravating in some ways to have to think about some of the things
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.480]   you wrote about in the book, but as I kept on going through it, I realized it was a method
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   to the madness.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.240]   Then I read about why you did it this way, why you wrote the book this way.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.120]   Could you talk about that?
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.160]   You're thinking of how you put this book together as opposed to all your other books.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.520]   The book grew out of a couple of different things I've been thinking about.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.300]   One of the ways I've described the book to people is that I like to think of it as the
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:33.960]   conversation that you should be having with a really good financial advisor.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:40.080]   A really good financial advisor isn't going to be purely concerned with making sure that
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.840]   you end up with the right seven mutual funds.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.580]   A really good financial advisor should be trying to figure out what it is that you really
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.960]   want from your financial life.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.280]   What's going to improve it today?
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.680]   What's going to make you happy in the future?
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.160]   What are the goals that you truly care about?
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.880]   Not simply that you want to retire, but what sort of retirement do you want?
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.920]   What is it that you're going to do with this last 20 or 30 years of your life?
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:13.440]   A good financial advisor is going to figure out that stuff, and then he or she is going
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.160]   to help you figure out how to get there.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.240]   It's not just about building the right portfolio.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:26.280]   There's so much more to managing money than having those six or seven mutual funds.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.080]   You need to figure out your estate planning.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.760]   You need to figure out whether you should be paying down your debt faster than is required.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.080]   You need to be figuring out insurance.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.240]   You need to be figuring out what sort of house you can afford to buy, what you should be
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   doing with your cars.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.120]   All of this stuff is part of building a robust financial life, and that's what the 77 days
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   are about.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:56.740]   It's about figuring out where you stand, what you want, and how you're going to get there.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.960]   The premise is that you can do it with these 77 steps, and the 77 steps are a mix.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.560]   Some days it is about information gathering.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.800]   Some days it's about teasing out what you want.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.380]   Some days it's giving you a brief financial lesson about some topics that I think is crucial
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:19.200]   to understanding money, and some days it's setting up specific steps that you ought to
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   take.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   The book gets deep into behavioral finance without calling it behavioral finance.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.040]   What I find is that you're able to describe things in layman terms without having to put
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:39.600]   100 footnotes in there and references to behavioral finance studies and such, but you're able
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:47.520]   to take a lot of the biases and behavioral finance things that we know in academia and
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:56.800]   you're able to very efficiently and very cleanly use it to describe what people should do or
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:03.960]   shouldn't do, or at least get people to think about their behavior and how their behavior
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.480]   affects their finances.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   That's what I found very interesting about the book is most of the time when you read
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.120]   a book like this, you're constantly seeing footnote, footnote, footnote, footnote, footnote.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.800]   This study, that study, this study, that study.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.720]   You've avoided all of that in the book, and I commend you for that.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.000]   I think that's great.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.960]   But this is a very well-researched and very well-written book that encompasses just so
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.920]   much, and I think you really hit what you were trying to do here with this book.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.040]   Well, in many ways, Rick, and thank you for your kind words, but in many ways, you know,
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:47.600]   the book is a product of the decades I've spent, you know, thinking about money, and
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:55.520]   one of the challenges of writing regularly about money is that the basics are indeed
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   pretty basic.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.000]   You know, the basics of putting together a portfolio, of figuring out how much insurance
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.320]   you need, what you need to do in terms of estate planning, you know, paying down debt,
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.320]   and so on.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:13.280]   This stuff is really not that complicated, and if you're going to survive as a financial
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.360]   writer, you need to have some intellectual curiosity and start to delve into other areas
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.860]   of finance, and I've been the beneficiary, at least in terms of my longevity as a financial
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.600]   writer, of some of the great research that has come out of academia, the research on
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:36.920]   behavioral finance, on neuroeconomics, on evolutionary psychology, on money and happiness,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:42.600]   all of these four areas have produced incredible insights that are so useful to us as managers
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:49.880]   of our own money, and I've had really the pleasure of swimming in this research for
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:58.120]   the past 20-plus years, and so while the book reflects that research, it's not like I sat
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.440]   down and read it all over, you know, in the year running up to the book's publication.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.640]   I have been absorbing this for years and years, and it's sort of become part of the way I
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.840]   think about money. I'm not an original thinker, but, you know, I am pretty good at synthesizing
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.080]   what's out there, and that's what the book represents.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.880]   There's a few things you wrote in here, which caught my attention very quickly. You have
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.600]   these great little quotes at the end of every chapter, but it's not, "This is what you've
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.280]   learned in this chapter." It's a saying, or it's something that you put together, and
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.800]   I want to read you one of them, because I found it very interesting. It's actually from
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:43.200]   day 44. You said, "If our net worth was displayed on our foreheads for all to see, libraries
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.960]   would be mobbed, and used cars would be status symbols." And it took me a second to think
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.520]   about that, saying, "Libraries would be mobbed, and used cars would be status symbols." Well,
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.160]   of course, yeah, I started thinking about it, saying, "Sure, you wouldn't buy a book.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.560]   You'd go to the library and get one for free, and you wouldn't buy a new car. You'd go out
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.640]   and buy a used car, and that would be a status symbol, because what would be on your forehead
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   is a big number."
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.920]   You know, probably one of the most influential books I think that any of us have read over
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.800]   the past 20 years is "The Millionaire Next Door," and this notion that it's not the money
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:24.560]   that you see, it's the money that you don't see, right? It's the millionaire next door
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.320]   living in the modest home, wearing clothes from J.C. Penney, and driving the second-hand
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:35.160]   car. That's the millionaire. The millionaire isn't, you know, the big house with his or
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.680]   her European sedan and the beautifully landscaped lawn. That's not money. That's money that
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:48.360]   is gone. That's money that is spent. And yet, the money that is still there often isn't
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:54.600]   visible. You see this on the Bogleheads Forum. The Bogleheads Forum isn't just about low-cost
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   investing. It's about having sensible habits when it comes to spending money. I think this
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.760]   is one of the reasons why you see so much overlap between the Bogleheads and what's
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.880]   become a very hot topic in recent months, which is the FIRE movement, you know, Financial
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.280]   Independence Retire Early, that frugality cuts not just across investing, but across
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:24.680]   our entire financial lives. And being frugal about how we handle our money is the key to
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.880]   wealth. And that's why, you know, I came up with that. If we all knew how much everybody
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.960]   was worth, and you saw somebody driving a BMW with a negative net worth, you would just
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   laugh out loud.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.720]   >>STEVE: I get it. Yeah, that's true.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.680]   >>JOHN: But because we don't see the net worth on their forehead, we don't get the chance
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   to laugh at them.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.480]   >>STEVE: Great. Yeah, that's perfect. That's great. And you, in fact, you followed up with
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:52.440]   that. And another day, Day 52, you talked about want to hurt your happiness, buy a big
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:32:00.000]   house involving lots of upkeep and a long commute. I think a lot of us are guilty of
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.760]   that. You know, as soon as you buy the big house, now you've got big bills to keep it
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.400]   up. And it might be nice to show off for a while, but after a while, people stop coming
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.120]   and you just have bigger bills.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.920]   >>STEVE: You had one more thing in here I want to talk about. And that is something
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:25.440]   you wrote on Day 70, which talked about limiting yourself to one financial advisor, one bank,
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.360]   and one brokerage firm or mutual fund family. And I want to talk about that because it always
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.840]   comes up on the Bogleheads where people say, "Oh, I have three or four banks because I
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.960]   want to diversify. I have two or three different advisors because I want to diversify. I don't
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:46.440]   want to keep all my money at one particular firm, call it Vanguard or Schwab or TD or
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.680]   wherever. I want to diversify because what happens if one of those companies go under?"
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.440]   You're actually saying, "No, don't worry about that here."
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:00.520]   >>TOM: So in terms of what I call naive diversification, multiple financial advisors, multiple banks,
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.120]   multiple mutual fund companies, multiple brokerage firms, yeah, I don't see that there is much
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.680]   benefit to this with one narrow exception. I do appreciate that there is this FDIC limit
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:19.000]   of $250,000. And if you have a ton of money in the bank, in order to make sure that you're
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.200]   covered by that $250,000, you may need to use multiple banks. But other than that, why
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.760]   would you use two financial advisors? What you're going to end up probably is two portfolios
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:37.040]   that have massive amounts of overlap, for which you're paying excessive cost. You're
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.640]   not getting any added value. If you can't find one financial advisor who's doing the
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:48.080]   job for you, you've got a big problem. Similarly, if you go to a brokerage firm, you're getting
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.440]   diversification not from the brokerage firm, but from the investments that you buy. If
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:58.600]   you have 10 different ETFs, that's your diversification. The fact that they're all held at one brokerage
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:05.440]   firm is of no import. It's not like the brokerage firm is going to go under and suddenly all
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.040]   your assets are gone. Those assets are held by a separate custodian. You should have no
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.080]   reason to worry about that. Ditto for using multiple mutual fund companies. I don't see
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:21.040]   any point in that. You can have all your mutual funds at one company. Each fund is a separate
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.000]   company. Each of those investments is held by the outside custodian. There should be
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   no extra risk involved.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.640]   It's true. It is that way. Some people still have this belief that they need to be diversified
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.320]   amongst where they keep their money. I'm glad you wrote that in the book because it's just
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:45.860]   not true. I personally have all my money at Vanguard. I don't have any reason to put it
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:52.400]   anywhere else. Even if I wanted to buy an exchange-traded fund that was traded by iShares,
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.720]   I could buy it through Vanguard. I don't need to have multiple custodians.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:03.400]   Now, if somebody has a 401(k), of course, they have to have the money in that 401(k),
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:10.560]   but once they retire, they can roll that into an IRA account at the one custodian that they
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.520]   choose. I'm not saying Vanguard's the place. It could be Schwab. It could be wherever,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.360]   but why complicate it? Why have a number of accounts at a number of custodians? Not only
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:25.640]   does it make it complicated for you, the investor, but if you should happen to pass away, it
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.480]   becomes 10 times more complicated for the person who has to pick all this up.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:36.200]   Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I do as you do, Rick. I have all of my investment dollars
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   at Vanguard. In fact, this may surprise people, I don't own any ETS. I own purely mutual funds,
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.560]   and the goal is simplicity here. When I pass away, my kids should be able to settle my
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.040]   estate in a couple of hours.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:59.920]   Yeah, I think that that's the whole idea of simplicity is the next phase of what's going
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:08.560]   on with financial writers. I know personally me, I just launched a new website, Core4Investing,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.840]   and it's all about being simple and simplicity. I think that the next phase, at least baby
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.880]   boomers like me, need to make things much more simple, need to make their portfolios
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:25.960]   simpler, need to make their estate simpler, need not to have five different IRA rollover
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.240]   accounts. If you're not going to go back to work, put them all together into one. There's
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.440]   no reason to have five anymore. If you have 401ks all over the place from different jobs,
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.480]   you don't need that. Bring them all together into one IRA, make it simple.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.800]   I think simplicity and how we manage our money is important, not just for us, but for the
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.840]   future generations.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.920]   And I would just add the corollary to that, which is that Wall Street battles this notion
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:59.040]   fiercely. They want investors to believe that there is some correlation between sophistication,
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.920]   complexity, and investment returns, and it simply isn't the case. I know so many high
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.480]   net worth individuals who end up in complicated investment products because they think they're
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.160]   getting something special, and they aren't. What they're getting is a complicated investment
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.520]   product as an excuse for charging high fees. If you want to be truly sophisticated, you
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.200]   should have a simple portfolio.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.320]   Very well put. Let's get back to one more item before I come to questions by the Bogleheads
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.000]   Forum. You talked about FIRE, Financial Independent Retire Early. This is getting to be quite
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.040]   a phenomenon, especially among millennials. First of all, could you elaborate a little
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:45.560]   bit more on what FIRE is, and then talk more about your viewpoint of these different facets
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   of FIRE?
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:53.760]   So the Financial Independence Retire Early movement is really about being extremely frugal
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:00.560]   early in your career, quickly buying yourself some financial freedom so that you can potentially
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:07.600]   retire at a relatively early age. Now, let's unpack that a little bit. When we talk about
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:13.680]   retirement, it's really not about retiring in the sense of you're going to go and live
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.640]   in Florida and spend all your days doing nothing. It's really about buying yourself the freedom
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:25.360]   to spend your days doing what you love. Of course, for many people, this idea of being
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:31.160]   frugal, buying yourself financial freedom quickly, and then using that freedom to spend
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.240]   your days doing what you love, that notion has been around for many decades. That certainly
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.440]   drove a lot of my financial behavior. I was a prodigious saver when I was in my 20s and
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.960]   30s, and that's what allows me today not to worry about earning a paycheck.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.840]   What the Financial Independence Retire Early movement, the FIRE movement, has done is it's
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:59.960]   conceptualized it in this single word, FIRE, and it's become a rallying cry for a certain
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:06.840]   group of devotees, but it's not that different from anything that we've known before. It's
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.480]   simply that it has coalesced around this one phrase and it has become something of a movement.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.280]   I think it's to be applauded. In a country where far too many people save way too little,
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.200]   the idea that we're celebrating people who are being smart about their money and saving
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.160]   diligently, what's wrong with that?
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:31.240]   Not a thing. Parlaying that, there are big companies out there that are being formed
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.660]   and have been around now for a while, companies like Betterment, where they're teaching young
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:41.040]   people right from the beginning, use low-cost index funds. Don't try to beat the market.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:46.080]   Just put a simple portfolio together of low-cost index funds. Granted, they're using ETFs because
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:52.760]   they're custodying the assets at a brokerage firm, but I always applauded companies like
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.840]   Wealthfront and Betterment and other robo-advisors because they're teaching young people right
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.960]   from the beginning, and don't bother trying to beat the market. Just have a consistent
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.600]   investment strategy, a consistent saving strategy. Just put the money away. It's all part of
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.960]   the same movement, and I think it's all very good.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:18.200]   Yeah, I think anything that focuses on holding down costs, whether it's the costs in your
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.120]   day-to-day living, the costs in your investment portfolio, the costs of your insurance, the
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.440]   cost of putting together your estate plan, as long as you're being smart in the choices
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.800]   you make, what's wrong with that? The less money that goes to these financial service
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.000]   providers, the more money that ends up in your pocket.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.160]   In the last part of the interview today, I'm going to go to the Bogleheads forum. I asked
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.700]   the Bogleheads on bogleheads.org to come up with some questions for you. A lot of people
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.360]   had a lot of great comments for you saying how they followed you for years and gave you
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:02.240]   a lot of kudos, but there were a few questions. I'm going to go through a few of those questions
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.520]   now and sort of wrap them off, one, two, three, four.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:12.960]   Here was the first question, and this was by Rosemary 11. Actually, she asked you three
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.080]   questions, so I'll do one, two, three, and then you can put them all together if you'd
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:23.600]   like. I am in retirement. What is an acceptable asset allocation in retirement? That was her
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.680]   first question. What is an acceptable asset allocation in retirement? Her second one was,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:34.160]   what international allocation, I think she's talking about stocks, as a percentage of the
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:40.100]   asset allocation? Thirdly, what is a safe withdrawal rate in retirement? Some three
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.880]   broad general questions. One, two, three, if you can hit them.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:50.040]   In terms of the right asset allocation, that's going to vary from one person to the next.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.400]   Much depends on how much of your expenses are going to be covered by Social Security.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:02.160]   It's going to depend on whether you have a traditional employer pension. It also might
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.280]   depend on whether you have anything else that's generating income, for instance, rental real
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:15.080]   estate. As a rule of thumb, 50 to 60 percent in stocks is probably a reasonable target.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:24.640]   What I would say as an upper limit on that is, you should know exactly where you're going
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:31.880]   to get your next five years of portfolio withdrawals from, and that money, at a minimum, should
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:38.640]   be invested in something conservative. CDs, short-term bonds, high-yield savings accounts,
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.880]   something like that. To get to your third question, Rick, if you're using the four percent
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:49.040]   withdrawal rate, which I think is a fine number, at a bare minimum, you should have at least
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:56.160]   20 percent of your portfolio in cash or near-cash investments so that you can cover the next
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.880]   five years of portfolio withdrawals. Now, that suggests that potentially you could have
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.640]   20 percent in stocks. I think that's way too much. I would probably go, as I said, for
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:09.160]   50 or 60 percent in stocks. At a minimum, you want that 20 percent for five years of
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.920]   four percent withdrawal rates stacked in cash or cash-like investments so that you're covered
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:21.040]   in case the market goes down steeply. In terms of the second question about international
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.160]   allocation on a stock portfolio, my view on this has shifted over the years. Personally,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:33.920]   I now have a market-weighted portfolio when it comes to stocks, which means, effectively,
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:41.400]   that I have half my money in U.S. stocks and half of my money in foreign stocks. I've done
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:48.120]   that for one simple reason, which is, who am I to think that I know better than all
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.280]   other investors collectively? If all other investors worldwide collectively believe that
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.960]   half of global stock market value is in the U.S. and half is outside the U.S., shouldn't
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:07.600]   I, as a hardcore indexer, replicate those percentages? The caveat in that is, of course,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:16.480]   you are introducing a fair amount of currency risk into a portfolio. If you're uncomfortable
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:22.400]   with the degree of currency risk, I would say either hold less in international stocks
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:29.240]   or potentially seek out a fund that hedges its currency exposure. But as things stand,
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:35.920]   I'm not sure of a fund that would give you low-cost foreign stock exposure with a currency
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   hedge.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:41.360]   Well, thank you, John. That was a good answer. Let me go to another question, which is something
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.560]   to do with what you just talked about, so we can hit this one too. This is from CW Radio,
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:53.080]   who asks, "As a safety-first investor that is in retirement, what investment should I
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:45:00.720]   put my safe money in?" And I think you already touched on this with the 20%, but I think
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:08.480]   he's looking for SPIA, which is a single premium insurance annuity, a bond ladder, tips, and
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:16.320]   so forth. He's asking if these are also acceptable places to put safe money.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:22.760]   I think all of those are acceptable places to put safe money. If you're going to buy
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:28.800]   an immediate fixed annuity, I would buy from more than one insurance company, and I would
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.920]   buy from insurance companies with a high rating for financial strength. An immediate fixed
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:39.960]   annuity is a great way to hedge longevity risk and ensure that you have a stable stream
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:45.000]   of monthly income. You just don't want to get it derailed because you buy from a single
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.160]   shaky insurance company and the insurance company goes under.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.880]   In terms of the bond portfolio, I've always favored taking risk on the stock side of the
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:01.600]   portfolio and playing it safe with bonds. In my own portfolio, I own pretty much a 50/50
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.560]   split for the bond portfolio between inflation index, treasury of bonds, and high-quality
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:13.640]   short-term corporates. But if you want to go for added safety, you might add in a mix
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.560]   of high-quality short-term treasuries as well rather than taking the credit risk that comes
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.760]   even with high-quality corporates.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.660]   This is from a poster by the name of Beanie. It says, "Jonathan Clements used to recommend
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:34.840]   putting 15% to 20% of one's stock allocation in diversifiers such as merger arbitrage funds,
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.760]   commodity funds, gold funds, and REITs." I haven't seen him talking about this in a long
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   time, maybe 10 years or more. Have his views changed? If so, why?
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.640]   I never recommend as much as 20%. I do remember writing a column for the Wall Street Journal
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.840]   when people were all hot and bothered about alternative investments, and this was a question
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:06.240]   I was getting a lot. I did indeed say that if you really want alternative exposure in
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:13.480]   your portfolio, I could see allocating 10% of a portfolio and no more to alternative
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:19.840]   investments. In terms of alternative investments, it was the list that you recommended -- real
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:27.720]   estate investment trusts, gold stocks, commodity funds, and precious metals funds.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:34.520]   I still think that's a reasonable allocation. I have to say, I don't particularly like merger
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:41.480]   arbitrage funds because they involve active management, and I have soured on commodities
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:49.160]   funds. Those have become more actually traded. It's gone from being a market where companies
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:56.760]   and farmers hedge to being a market dominated by investors. The historic, impressive returns
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:03.320]   from the commodity indexes hasn't been replicated and, in all likelihood, will not be replicated.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:10.680]   So I'm not that crazy about commodities funds. I still have a soft spot for gold stock funds
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.200]   and I still have a soft spot for real estate investment trusts, but I probably wouldn't
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.280]   put more than a couple of cents of a portfolio in each.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.760]   What if somebody did any of that and just bought the three-fund portfolio?
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:30.320]   I think the three-fund portfolio is a great portfolio to own. You and I have had this
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   conversation, Rick. People tend to mess around way too much with their portfolios. I think
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.440]   I've done too much of that myself over the years. If you simply buy the three-fund portfolio
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:49.480]   -- total U.S. market, total international, and total bond -- I think that's a great mix.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.400]   You may even want to consider the two-fund portfolio. You can now go to Vanguard and
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:00.520]   buy the total world index fund and add the total bond market fund onto that, and you
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:06.920]   could have an incredibly diversified portfolio with an asset allocation of your choice with
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.760]   just two mutual funds.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   Incredible. It wasn't that way years ago, though. Things have gotten so much better
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:19.040]   in indexing space where you can really reduce the number of holdings that you need nowadays
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.640]   to be diversified globally. It's really gotten a lot better, and the fees have come down
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   so much.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:32.280]   That total world index fund, I believe, has something in the range of 8,000 stocks in
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:39.520]   that fund. For a $3,000 investment -- or you can buy the ETF and invest even less -- you
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:46.760]   can buy a portfolio with 8,000 different stocks in it. Think about that. That is astonishing.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:55.160]   Today, the everyday investor, with $10,000 or $20,000 to invest, can build a portfolio
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:50:01.360]   that many institutional investors two decades ago would have died to have. It would be lower
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:07.960]   cost and better diversified. It's astonishing what ordinary investors can do with their
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.880]   money today. Really astonishing.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:19.760]   The last question has to do with buying happiness. This is from TomP10. I'm going to just paraphrase
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.520]   what he's saying. You've always talked about, and one of the things that make you unique
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:33.720]   is the spending side of happiness. If spending actually makes people happy. He was wondering
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:41.320]   about your thoughts on spending. We've talked an awful lot about investing and saving, but
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:48.080]   he wants to know specifically your thoughts about spending and how to spend correctly
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.960]   to make you happier.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:59.040]   As I've written in numerous places, I believe that money can buy happiness in three ways.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:06.840]   First, money can buy happiness simply by eliminating financial worries. So many people in America
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:12.760]   pursue happiness at the shopping mall, rack up their credit cards, and end up miserable
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:18.320]   because they leave themselves in a financially perilous state. Whatever they manage to buy
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:24.200]   at the mall is no solace when they're awake in the middle of the night worrying about
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.520]   what happens if they lose their job or how they're going to pay the credit card bill.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:34.520]   Simply being smart about money, having a little money in the bank, saving for the future,
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:41.240]   avoiding debt except for mortgage debt, that alone is going to buy you substantial happiness.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.760]   So that's the first way that money can buy happiness.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.960]   Second, money can buy happiness if you can reach the point where you can spend your days
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:56.480]   doing what you love. There are a few things in life that bring greater happiness than
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:02.200]   working hard at something you care passionately about. So if you can get yourself to that
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   point, like the fire people talk about, where you don't need a regular paycheck or you need
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:11.320]   a much smaller paycheck and you can spend your days doing what you love, that is the
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.120]   second way that money can buy happiness.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.580]   The third way, and this is probably what the question is getting at, is I believe the third
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:24.640]   way that money can buy happiness is we can use it to create special times with friends
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:30.720]   and family. And there are a couple of different elements to this. First, we know that spending
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.000]   time with friends and family gives an enormous boost to happiness. Research suggests that
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.120]   that is indeed the case. In fact, the research suggests that having a robust network of friends
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:48.000]   and family not only makes you happier, but it also gives a boost to longevity equal in
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.120]   effect to not smoking. So having a robust network of families is not only good for your
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.520]   happiness, but it's also good for your health.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.840]   So in terms of using money, what you want to do is spend it not on material goods, which
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.920]   are often enjoyed on your own, but on experiences. Taking the family on vacation, organizing
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:13.360]   the family reunion, going out to dinner with friends, going to the theater with a colleague.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:20.360]   Those experiences enjoyed with friends and family can give a big boost to happiness.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.760]   But there's another element to this, which is if you really want to get a lot of happiness
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:30.280]   out of your spending on experiences with friends and family, you should arrange these things
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:36.720]   far ahead of time so that you have a long period of eager anticipation. That way, you'll
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.400]   get a lot more happiness out of the dollars you're about to spend. And you should make
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:47.560]   sure that you keep mementos to remind you of the event in question. When you go on vacation,
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:53.080]   you should take photographs, and then you should put them up around your house so that
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:58.360]   the months afterwards, you can think, "Wow, that was such a great trip. I had such a good
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:03.680]   time. And here, every day when I walk to the living room, is that photograph that reminds
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:09.480]   me of what a special time in my life that was." So that, in terms of actually spending
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.840]   money, would be my number one tip.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:17.040]   Well, that's great, Jonathan. I want to thank you so much. You've made us all very happy
