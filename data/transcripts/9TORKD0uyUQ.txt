[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820]   Steve in Nashville writes in with today's question. Pastor John, thank you for your ministry. To your knowledge, were any writers of the Bible
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.820]   self-consciously aware that they were being inspired by the Holy Spirit as they wrote? What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.780]   Let me answer by pointing to three authors of Scripture or at least three kinds of writing in Scripture.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.860]   Even though
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.180]   we're not
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180]   given a window
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.180]   onto the very moment when the Old Testament prophets put their oral prophecies into writing,
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.260]   I think it's fair to infer that
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.280]   since they knew God was giving them words of his very own to speak orally,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.480]   he would also take care to help them preserve those words when they or others came to write them down.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.100]   If you look up in a concordance,
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.140]   how many times in the Old Testament the phrase
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.480]   "Thus says the Lord"
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.660]   occurs?
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.220]   You will find in the ESV that it occurs
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.680]   417 times. Wow. That's incredible.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:23.540]   351 of those, and by the way, that's only "Thus says the Lord." It might be "says the Lord" or
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.020]   "says God" or I only looked up that one phrase. There may be hundreds and hundreds of others with various wording.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.540]   351 of those occur in the books of the prophets, and in some of these cases God himself
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.900]   says to the prophet that they should say "Thus says the Lord."
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.860]   Like Jeremiah 11 3, "You shall say to them 'Thus says the Lord' or Zechariah 6 12,
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.640]   and say to them 'Thus says the Lord' or Isaiah 38 5, 'Say to Hezekiah,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.860]   "Thus says the Lord God." And the point is that God intended
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.300]   for his authoritative spokesman to know that they were speaking
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.020]   authoritatively for him.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.980]   Now, we should remind ourselves, I think, that the reason we embrace the Old Testament
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.420]   Scriptures as God's Word is not
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.340]   insanely because every author makes explicit that he was inspired by God. They don't.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.940]   But that the Lord Jesus
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.020]   himself
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020]   put his seal on
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.500]   the authority and the inerrancy of the Old Testament in several places in the New Testament, like John 10 35.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.820]   "The Scripture cannot be broken," Jesus said.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.380]   And that the Scriptures themselves
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.940]   reveal a
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.980]   self-authenticating glory as the very Word of God.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.660]   My second example of an author is Paul.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.860]   He said to the Corinthians, "We impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God which God decreed beforehand for the ages for our glory."
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.340]   These things God has revealed to us through the Spirit.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.980]   "We have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.620]   freely given us by God." And we impart these in
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.180]   words not taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 2
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.820]   7 to 13. And we can get a glimpse
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.180]   into how Paul saw the way this played out in his
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.820]   writings—so we go from human words taught by the Spirit down to the writings in 1 Corinthians 14 37—
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.300]   where he says, "If anyone thinks that he's a prophet or spiritual, he should acknowledge
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.500]   that the things I am writing—
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.620]   writing to you—are a command of the Lord. If anyone does not recognize this, he is not
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.620]   recognized." In other words, Paul saw his
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.180]   writings as
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.020]   carrying an authority—referred to back in 1 Corinthians 2—which every other claim to prophecy
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.820]   should submit to. And the last illustration I'll give is the Apostle John writing the book of Revelation.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.660]   He says, "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to show to his servants
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.740]   the things that must soon take place, he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.500]   who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.740]   Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and keep
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.540]   what is written in it."
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.860]   So it seems pretty clear to me that John knew he was receiving special
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.140]   revelation from the Lord and that it was being written
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.020]   down. But again, let me stress—in conclusion, let me stress—that our
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.900]   final, unshaken
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.660]   confidence
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.660]   rises not
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.660]   decisively or finally from the personal claims of each biblical author to have been
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.340]   inspired, but rather
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.820]   from the peculiar marks of God's glory that shines through
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   God's Word when the Holy Spirit
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.860]   enables us to discern what it means. I wrote a whole book about this last year. It was just published this year.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.860]   It's called "A Peculiar
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.660]   Glory—How the Christian Scriptures Reveal Their Complete
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.140]   Truthfulness." And if that's what Steve is wrestling with, I hope he'll look at it.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.860]   Yeah, very good book to check out at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.220]   There's a lot of great books to read there, too. Check out everything we have—
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.580]   over a hundred titles, I think, now available for you—DesiringGod.org/books.

[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.380]   our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. And on Friday,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.660]   we're gonna close out the week by pressing into one of the more common questions that we get in the inbox—
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.340]   one that I don't think we've ever addressed yet in the past.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.860]   And it's a question over whether or not our loved ones who are in heaven can look down on us and see us.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.460]   We'll take a biblical look at a few different texts to try and figure out this question on Friday.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.620]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
