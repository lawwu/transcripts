[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   I have a take on nuancing productivity that I think will be useful.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.120]   And I'm capturing that take in today's deep question, which is, is productivity about
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   optimization or autonomy?
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.760]   And in answering that question, I think we're going to get a more nuanced take of how to
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:27.920]   think about productivity and its potential roles in our life.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.840]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, the show about living and working deeply in
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.000]   an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.160]   I'm here in the Deep Work HQ, joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   You know, Jesse, last week we talked about Ginny O'Dell and her new book that was taking
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.040]   a nuanced look at time and the treatment of time in our lives.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.120]   And one of the things that we brought up during that episode, one of the things that caught
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.920]   my attention was there's typically this, I don't want to say bad guy, but antagonist,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.600]   I would say, in these sort of new treatments of time, these antagonists that are often
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.880]   go by the names of productivity bros.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.560]   Now I feel out of touch because I don't use the internet that much.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960]   I'm not on social media.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.040]   I don't browse on YouTube.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   So I didn't really know.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.640]   I mean, I remember the old school productivity bros from when I was coming up, when Tim Ferriss
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.440]   was very focused, when there was 43 folders, was very focused on optimizing time.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.360]   But I didn't really know what has productivity bro culture evolved into.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.780]   So I did a little searching to try to understand what was going on.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.040]   And I found an article that I think was useful in enlightening us.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.120]   I'm going to put it on the screen here for people who are watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.760]   This is episode 240.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   You can also find it at thedeeplife.com.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.680]   So I found this article from Vice titled the relentless rise of the quote productivity
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.000]   influencer in quote.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.320]   This is an article from Claire Hubble from last year, last winter.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.160]   So I was looking through here.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.080]   There's our friend Ali Abdul.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   I did a show.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   I did his podcast.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   I like him a lot.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   All right.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.080]   So here's some quotes.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.720]   I just want to read a couple of quotes from this because it helped bring me up to speed.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.400]   With the way people are thinking about this online culture.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   So here's one quote.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.920]   I have it on the screen right now.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.440]   In recent years, the popularity of heavily staged managed self optimization has diversified
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.960]   beyond the tech bros of Silicon Valley, spawning the rise of a new influencer niche, the productivity
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.400]   guru.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.120]   These content creators have gained thousands of followers by posting time saving tips,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.320]   life hacks and productivity advice on line.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.800]   Here's another quote.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   This comes from a critic of these of this new culture, I suppose.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.280]   This is someone named, what is her name here?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.880]   I don't know who this, but she's on the screen right now.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.200]   Anyways, this was her critique.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920]   I have no desire to grind 24/7 and exhaust myself.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.380]   I've suffered from burnout many times before.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.540]   So I've really tried to actively remove those toxic hustle culture ideas from my mind.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.300]   My focus was just to get through each day, sometimes at a bare minimum.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.860]   All right, so here's what I'm concluding from this piece.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.180]   The new world of online influencer, which is more based on YouTube and Instagram and
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.500]   TikTok, this new visual social media world has bred a new generation of what seems to
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.780]   be relatively young productivity influencers.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.100]   You know, kids these days, I like the idea that this reporter for Vice thinks that's
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   new.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.540]   I'm old enough to remember when Stephen Covey sold 14 million copies of the seven habits
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.140]   of highly effective people.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.900]   Hint, there had been people talking about productivity for a while now.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.540]   Though I see this a lot often where something is rediscovered by TikTok culture and then
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.160]   is thought by that generation to be brand new.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.540]   It's like when time blocking took off on TikTok and I went on the today show to talk about
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.540]   it.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.540]   I mean, we've been talking about this for a while, but TikTok is its own world.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.140]   They sort of rediscovered time blocking.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.980]   I was like the old man on that today show clip.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.300]   I'm like, well, let's have the old man come on and talk about TikTok because our viewership
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.220]   is older and we need someone that our old audience relates to who doesn't understand
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.220]   the TikToks.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.100]   So this seems to be happening is that productivity obviously as a topic has been a popular topic
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.740]   for a long time, but it's now being picked up in this online world.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.380]   And as based off this quote here, it seems like this online productivity culture seems
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.580]   to be focused on grinding, hustling, producing more.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.020]   Some of the other videos I watched stemming off of this article here seem to focus on
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.060]   making money on the side.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.180]   How do you make $500,000 extra dollars a year?
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.900]   Here's how I'm going to make a million extra dollars a year.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.140]   Here's how I'm going to fit that all in.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.780]   So I wanted today to dive a little bit deeper into this because I think if we blinker our
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.940]   understanding of productivity to be what we see in these online videos of here's how to
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.900]   hustle to make an extra $500,000 a year by being very careful with your time management
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.420]   and low friction systems, we lose a lot.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.100]   We push people to take a more of the philosophical route towards, I want to wash my hands of
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.940]   all of this.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.100]   Productivity is this weird hustle culture stuff.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.140]   I am with weary resignation going to just say that's not for me.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:03.620]   And I don't know that walking away from any sort of systematic intent to control and organize
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.680]   the obligations in your life is really actually a good solution.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.020]   So what we need is a more nuanced understanding of technology.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.680]   That's what I want to, or not technology, productivity.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.820]   That's what I want to tackle today.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.660]   I have a take on nuancing productivity that I think will be useful.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.900]   And I'm capturing that take in today's deep question, which is, is productivity about
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.180]   optimization or autonomy?
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.540]   And in answering that question, I think we're going to get a more nuanced take of how to
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.820]   think about productivity and its potential roles in our lives.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.500]   So I want to do a deep dive on that.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.460]   I've then pulled five questions that all loosely orbit around this topic.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.300]   So it's five questions from you, my listeners, that I'm going to come at each of these from
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.180]   the perspective of a productivity perspective, based on what we're just about to talk about.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.300]   And then for the third segment of the show, we'll shift to something different.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.260]   Today what I want to talk about later in the show is the books I read in February.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.340]   So every, every month I like to talk about the books I read.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.220]   So we'll shift gears later in the show.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.780]   All right, so let's start about, let's start with this question.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.980]   Is productivity about optimization or autonomy?
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.700]   Well, what do I mean about that?
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.500]   Well, what I mean by this is there's two frames through which you can think about and engage
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.420]   with productivity.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.740]   The first frame is optimization.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.060]   Now, optimization is on my mind.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.020]   I'm actually reading a pretty interesting book right now about optimization and its
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.740]   influence on our culture.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.540]   I'm not going to talk too much about the details of that book yet, because I want to wait until
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.860]   I finish it and it's closer to it actually coming out.
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.500]   But I will say it has been giving me some interesting food for thought.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.140]   So one of the things that's clear is optimization, if we're going to be technical about it, focuses
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:53.620]   on maximizing an objective function, all subject to constraints.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.300]   So you have some thing you're trying to maximize, the amount of money you make per year from
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.740]   your side hustle, for example, the number of pages you write in your book, you have
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.860]   some constraints about what's available to you, what time, etc.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.460]   And given those constraints, you want to come up with models or approaches that's going
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:17.860]   to maximize that output, maximize the benefit that is captured by that objective function.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.620]   So it's about getting the most of something that is valuable to you.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.260]   Now, I think the YouTube types that are being referenced in that Vice article, the YouTube
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:34.140]   types that maybe Ginny Odell is thinking about in her critiques, look at productivity through
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.620]   this optimization frame.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.820]   Here, let me pull one up.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.380]   I've been watching a lot of productivity YouTube recently.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.980]   So here's an example of one of the videos I've been watching recently.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.100]   This is from a productivity YouTuber named Amy Landino.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.580]   This video is called Secrets of a Super Productive Boss Lady.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.200]   If you're watching along online, you'll see this up on the screen.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.020]   It's very meta.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.540]   On the YouTube video of this podcast, we're showing someone else's YouTube video.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.140]   So there you go.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.940]   I watched this video and it's a bunch of advice about how to fit more into your day.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.900]   Amy has a clear definition of high achiever.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.460]   That means juggling lots of things.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.380]   So her whole goal with this video is how can you be a high achiever without completely
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380]   burning out?
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.020]   So it's about juggling lots of different obligations.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.920]   I think this is probably a pretty common theme among these types of productivity YouTubers.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.340]   So this is all about optimization.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.860]   You have something that's valuable, like the number of things you get done, you're trying
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.800]   to optimize it.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.620]   How do I get the highest value of this function?
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.020]   How do I get, in this case, the most things done?
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.640]   And you say, well, let me use color-coded planners and I can use my Google Calendar.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.980]   She talks about this in that video.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.780]   She lives by her Google Calendar.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.100]   Even her sleep is on there.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.260]   Let me use very careful systems that can low friction, capture notes and keep things at
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.260]   bay.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.640]   There's a lot of work in these about hiring lots of different virtual assistants to help
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   manage things.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.480]   So it's all about maximizing an optimization function.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.840]   There is however, another frame through which to think about productivity, and that is autonomy.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:17.200]   Now to understand the connection between productivity and autonomy, it's important to think first
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   about what the antonym of productivity is.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.520]   So instead of trying to define productivity, let's define what it is to not have any organized
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.960]   thinking about productivity in your professional life.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.580]   And what you're going to end up with is what I call haphazard busyness.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.280]   So if your life sub comes to haphazard busyness, which is where you will almost certainly end
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:45.040]   up if you, like Ginny O'Dell, you say, I just want to enjoy the birds, right?
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.560]   If you're saying I'm rejecting this idea that I want to think in an organized fashion about
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.400]   how I manage my obligations and time, you will probably end up with haphazard busyness,
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.960]   where you have a uncontrolled influx of various obligations of various urgency that you have
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.920]   a hard time keeping track of and tend to pull at your attention suddenly in an emergency
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.000]   type situations.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.640]   Haphazard busyness reduces your options.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.720]   It makes you feel stressed.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.800]   It's almost certainly going to lead to overload, too much to do.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.960]   And it tends to push people towards extreme solutions such as this is what work is.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.400]   So I need to find a way to leave the workforce, for example.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.120]   Productivity can be understood as applying organizational tool and deliberate processes
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.700]   to take back control of your obligations in such a way that you avoid haphazard busyness.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.000]   This is where, for example, you might deploy the types of approaches I talk about often
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.320]   on this show.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:49.280]   One of the big productivity frameworks I've often preached is capture, configure, control.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.160]   I have my video, my deep ideas video.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   What do we call them?
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160]   Core ideas, Jesse?
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   Core ideas.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.320]   My core ideas video on time management goes deep into this.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:05.560]   Actually that video was also Tim Ferriss played that whole video on his podcast feed not that
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   long ago.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.880]   So I don't want to go in too much detail now.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.560]   You can dive into it there, but at a high level, capture, configure, control is about
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.640]   capture things, obligations that enter your life, potential obligations that enter your
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.080]   life get captured.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.520]   They move out of your mind and in the trusted systems where they can later be dealt with.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.840]   You're not keeping track of what's on your plate just in your mind.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.320]   You have well-tinted task lists and calendars so that your mind is not responsible on its
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.480]   own to remember everything that's going on.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   That alone is a huge stress reliever.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.960]   Then comes configure.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.280]   Configure is the glue of the caption, configure, control framework.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.000]   It's where you make sense of all these obligations.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.200]   You figure out what they mean.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.500]   Critically it's where you implement your specific intentional workload management systems.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.640]   How much of this different type of work can I reasonably do?
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.240]   What are my quotas here?
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.880]   What once it's captured, do I keep going on with?
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.440]   What do I push out?
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.480]   If something has to happen later, when am I going to do it?
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   It's where you actually make sense of all of your obligations in an intentional way.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.280]   Not doing configure is what creates haphazard busyness.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.800]   You're just in this world of there's more than I can do and I'm just running around
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.480]   like a chicken with my head cut off.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480]   And then control.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.320]   You control how you actually use your time.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.000]   Weekly planning, daily planning, strategic planning.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.080]   What am I doing today?
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   When am I working?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   When am I not working?
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   When is this project going to unfold?
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.140]   Maybe I'm going to put this one here, start this project here.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.960]   That's where you actually assess the time resources available and come up with a plan
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.020]   for it.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.800]   So when you have something like a capture, configure, control framework in action, you
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.480]   move away from haphazard busyness.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.760]   Now here's where the autonomy frame takes its critical turn.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:56.580]   I think it is too often assumed that the only destination of taking control of your obligations
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.120]   with something like capture, configure, control, that the only destination you can then go
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.760]   to is optimization.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.940]   I control everything.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.940]   I configure everything.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   I've captured everything.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.940]   Great.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.940]   Now I can get more done.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.540]   I can be like the boss lady video.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:17.440]   What I want to argue today is that is selling short the potential of productivity.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.780]   Productivity gives you autonomy over what you want your work life to be like.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.340]   And this autonomy does not just mean optimization.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.300]   So let me give you four different options for what you can do, how you can aim your
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.360]   work life once you have your arms around it with some sort of reasonable productivity
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.820]   framework.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.660]   Number one, you could say my goal is a state in which like the boss lady video, I'm juggling
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.420]   lots of hard but important things successfully.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.260]   And I think this is, again, this is reasonable.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.660]   Let's say you've just started a new business.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660]   This is going to be the reality, right?
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.260]   You're going to have a lot of different things that have to happen.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.540]   Productivity framework is going to help you do that in a way that doesn't overwhelm you.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:03.180]   So that optimization mindset, what I'm trying to say here is not in itself malformed, but
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.280]   it's also not totalizing.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.980]   It's not going to be the only option we have here.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.780]   A second place you could aim your professional life once you have a productivity system is
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.500]   perhaps a state in which you're able to focus on a single thing that is hard, but really
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.260]   important to you.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.260]   So it's another, this is John Grisham, for example, controlling his obligation so he
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.380]   can just work on writing one book a year.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:33.180]   Without a productivity system, it is very difficult to focus on a single hard thing
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.820]   that's important.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.820]   Another writer example here, of course, is Neil Stevenson with his famous essay, Why
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.520]   I'm a Bad Correspondent.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.540]   He had to go through a lot of trouble to make sure that he could just focus on writing and
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.100]   not ending up in a more Brandon Sanderson-esque situation in which it's just constant work
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.340]   and projects and busyness.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:02.100]   The third place, by the way, speaking of Brandon Sanderson, not to go on a tangent here, Jesse,
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.900]   but one of our esteemed listeners sent me a photo of a bookstore that had a whole table
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.380]   of name of the wind that was labeled as Patrick Rufus.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.740]   And he was like, the gaslighting continues.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.180]   They keep trying to trick us into thinking Patrick Rufus wrote the name of the wind.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.380]   Again, if you're not a longtime listener, you don't know what we're talking about.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.180]   And to which I say, congratulations, it's all nonsense.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.980]   A third goal you might aim for, right, with a productivity system in place is a state
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:36.700]   in which you are trying to minimize work while maintaining financial stability.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.020]   Doing less things is actually ironically hard work.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.980]   If you want to set up a situation in which you say, you know what, I'm super flexible.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:49.300]   I work like 10 hours a week, but I have good benefits, make a good salary.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.540]   Productivity systems can get you there.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.380]   Simply deciding I want to work less probably won't get you there.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.140]   If you're in a state of haphazard busyness, it's immediately notable when you try to pull
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.860]   back and it causes all sorts of problems.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.420]   If you're capture, configure, controlling, if you're Cal Newporting, especially in this
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.140]   age of sort of knowledge workers working remotely, you can get away with a lot if you know what
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.020]   you're doing.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:16.420]   So yes, being super relaxed is another outcome of productivity systems.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.900]   And then finally, and this is probably, I would say the most common goal for those who
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.580]   listen to my show is trying to achieve a state of reasonable balance.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.420]   Hey, look, I like my job.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.860]   I want it to be within normal work hours and not expand beyond that.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.300]   And I want to have some slack in there.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.540]   So you know, if once or twice a month, I kind of need to pull back for a day or two, the
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.180]  re's appointments, some stuff going with my kids.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.900]   I can do that without it being a problem.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.340]   I don't want to be, I want to enjoy my job, go to my office, enjoy my coworkers, but feel
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.380]   like it has a reasonable footprint and have some slack or I can, you know, be sick for
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.340]   a couple of days and not have it be a big, different, a big deal.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.620]   That again is a state that you can achieve if you have some sort of reasonable productivity
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.580]   system in place.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:03.300]   So this is what I'm trying to argue for is we need a more expansive idea of productivity
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.300]   and its goals.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.060]   Yes, it could be used for sheer optimization.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.980]   And yes, there are times where that is appropriate.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.540]   If you just took on the $7 million Series A for your startup as a 27 year old tech
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.400]   entrepreneur, then optimization is probably what you should focus on.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.380]   How do I get all these different things that need to happen for my business to succeed
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.620]   done without a completely overwhelming me, but it can enable all of these other things
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.620]   as well.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:32.780]   It enables the, the severely pulled back because I have young kids and I just am done with
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.140]   work but need the financial.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.020]   It enables like I've got this nice balance.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:42.260]   It enables the Neil Stevenson, John Grisham, you know, I want to do this one thing, my
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.660]   art, my craft really well.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.860]   I have a major nonprofessional interest I really want to devote time to, but still need
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.180]   to have some sort of, you know, not let distractions come in and rip me away from it.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.700]   It could enable so much.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.820]   That is the autonomy frame for productivity.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.380]   A good productivity system allows you to take control.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:07.580]   Once you've taken control of the obligations in your professional life, you have options.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.200]   It's up to you what you do with those options.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.540]   But the message I want you to know is that those options are much more broad than the
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.940]   productivity bros nomenclature I think would typically reveal.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.940]   All right.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.140]   So that's my thought on that.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.620]   Now I have a, I want to apply this frame of the collection of questions from you about
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:31.140]   various issues in which I want to apply this autonomy productivity frame to help answer.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.940]   First however, I want to talk about one of our sponsors.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:40.020]   This show is, this episode is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:46.700]   Now one of the things we talk about often on this show when discussing the deep life
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.780]   is this idea that you have these different buckets in your life in which you're trying
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   to intentionally survey and improve.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.900]   I think one of the key buckets is the life of your mind.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:03.820]   It is difficult to really enjoy a deep life if your mind, if you'll excuse the recursion
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.600]   here, has a mind of its own.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.900]   If you're dealing with runaway rumination or anxiety or depressive affect, this is one
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.620]   of the key things that you want to get your arms around when crafting a life that's meaningful,
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.940]   sustainable, and humane.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.300]   Well just like if you want to get in better shape, you're going to hire a trainer.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:31.260]   If you want to get your mind back under control and working with you and not against you,
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.400]   therapy can help.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.660]   Now the hard thing about therapy, especially today in this post-COVID world, is that it
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:43.020]   can be difficult, logistically speaking, to find a nearby therapist that has openings.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.020]   It can be expensive.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.740]   You have to, you have to drive over there.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.860]   What if you don't like this person?
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.900]   It's awkward because how do you, how do you change this relationship?
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.960]   This I think is where BetterHelp has really changed the game.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.780]   It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.980]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.380]   You can switch therapist anytime for no additional charge.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:17.020]   I think if you are at all interested in improving your relationship with your mind, BetterHelp
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:22.020]   is a fantastic way to begin doing that.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.860]   So discover your potential with BetterHelp.

[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:43.580]   That's BetterHelp, H-E-L-P.com/deepquestions.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:49.700]   Another thing that, speaking of optimizing things in your life, if you're like me, there
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:56.540]   are things you know you need to do as a responsible adult that you have not done because you're
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.740]   not quite sure how to start.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.980]   I think life insurance is a great example of that.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.580]   If you have anyone who depends on you, you need life insurance, but you might not have
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.660]   it because you're not sure where to even start.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.660]   Again, what do you do?
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.940]   Do you go to a insurance agency at a strip mall somewhere?
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.140]   Like a guy comes out in a red polo shirt and there's a bunch of forms or something.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.440]   How does that even work?
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.940]   This is where our friends at Ladder enter the scene.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.400]   It is 100% digital.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.020]   If you were applying for $3 million in coverage or less, there's no doctors, no needles, and
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.220]   no paperwork.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.580]   You just answer a few questions online about your health.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.380]   You need just a few minutes and a phone or laptop to apply.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.380]   Smart algorithms work in real time, so you'll find out instantly if you're approved.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.380]   No hidden fees.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.380]   Cancel anytime.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.820]   Get a full refund if you change your mind in the first 30 days.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.820]   Ladder only deals with insurers that have long proven histories of paying claims.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.420]   We're talking insurers that are rated A and A+ by AM Best.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   This is it.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.700]   If you need life insurance and you don't have it, just go right now and do it.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.340]   Go to ladderlife.com/deeptoday and you will see if you're instantly approved.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.100]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep, ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:21.640]   All right, Jesse, I want to apply our new productivity frames, this idea of productivity
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.980]   as being a foundation for autonomy.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.580]   I'm going to apply it to some real life issues.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.940]   I think we've got a good collection of questions here where I can try that out.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.820]   Who is first on our docket of queries?
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.300]   Yeah, sounds good.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.540]   First question is from Andrew, a 33-year-old teacher from London.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.860]   I'm a full-time teacher, but previously worked in journalism.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.040]   I'd like to develop a side hustle writing about using walking to explore the history
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   in London.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.140]   My long-term goal is to write a short book or walking guide on whether I should start
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.580]   a blog as I want to be writing more frequently to sharpen my skills.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:01.940]   Well, Andrew, I'm going to use this whole desire of a side interest in producing a book
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:08.980]   about walking histories of London to test out our productivity perspective.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.700]   If you are haphazardly busy in your teaching job, it is going to be very unlikely you are
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.580]   going to succeed with this endeavor.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.900]   You'll have moments of inspiration, other times where you feel like you have no leeway
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.920]   to work on it, the project will make some progress, and then because of haphazardly
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.460]   busy periods will disappear for months.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.020]   You might sour on the idea, you might lose your momentum.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:37.380]   On the other hand, if you have a productivity framework in place, if you feel like you really
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.300]   do have control over the various obligations and your time, and when you work on it, you're
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.700]   capture configuring, controlling your teaching responsibilities, now you have a shot at succeeding
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.660]   with one of these projects.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.100]   You can figure out, do I have time for this?
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.740]   Where is that time best placed and then actually place that time in those locations.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.100]   There's all sorts of different options for how you might do this, but you're not going
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.940]   to be able to know what options are available or what is best until you really do have a
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.820]   framework in place in your professional life that is helping you control everything.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.580]   Now, I'm going to give a particular suggestion.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.300]   So assuming you do this, you get a control productivity system in place, you feel in
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:24.700]   control of your time and obligations, I was thinking about your specific project here,
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:30.220]   writing this book, walking history and your question in particular about, should you start
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.800]   a blog?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.820]   Is that going to be the right way to sharpen your skills and build this out?
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:41.500]   Well, my instinct is this project is probably a quality over quantity play.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.540]   I think you want to be producing specific walking tours.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.700]   Let's put the digital channel aside for now, but producing particular walking tours at
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.780]   a very high level.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:57.740]   So well-researched, either well videoed or photographed.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.540]   You have a map that you can follow it.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.420]   Not that often, maybe this is once every month or once every couple of months, but when you
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.180]   release one of these things, it's really, really high quality, really easy for people
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.180]   to follow and use.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.700]   It seems really professional.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:16.420]   This is the like Mr. Beast or Tim Urban frequency of content production where it's not every
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.860]   three days, but the stuff they put out, they've made excellent.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.020]   I think that's what you're looking for here.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.560]   Be so good, the stuff should be so good it can't be ignored.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.780]   I think that's going to be the most fulfilling for you and be the best foundation for eventually
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.700]   then collecting these into a book.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.100]   The channel question, I'm not sure.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.500]   I think if you just had a blog, sort of web 2.0 style, you had a domain and a WordPress
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   blog that might be not enough.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:50.860]   Given the way that digital media has evolved, you probably need some other sort of media
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.860]   involved here.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.580]   I mean, YouTube could be a big player here.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.220]   You could have very well produced videos where you're actually doing this walking tour, maybe
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.860]   sub stack as opposed to just so people could subscribe and you get sent these walking tours.
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:10.700]   It would be a narrow band of people subscribing, but you would have a good band of followers.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.620]   You could carefully put your toes in the professional social media.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.580]   Obviously, I'm not a big believer in spending people using social media as a source of personal
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.300]   distractions, something people are on on their own time just to sort of keep up with the
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.740]   world and be distracted.
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.860]   But an Instagram account, a professional Instagram account where it's just for you, whatever,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.660]   posting the photos from your latest tours that you're working on as it builds up to
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.820]   you, then launching your latest tour on a website connected to sub stack.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.860]   I don't know the right mix there.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.140]   You probably need a more heterogeneous mix than just a blog.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.220]   But that would be my guess is that once you get control over your teaching life, you have
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.700]   that productivity framework in place.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.860]   You'll be able to build a rhythm where you build up to once every couple of months, a
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.860]   great tour.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.820]   And I could imagine you do, you put aside a Saturday to really explore and scout things
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.420]   out and then you have some sessions to do your background research and writing.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.980]   And then you have another session a few weeks later where you actually go to do the video
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.540]   or photographs for the very nice actual tour put together.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.140]   I would also say don't hesitate.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.380]   I wouldn't hesitate too much about spending some money on this as well because you're
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.160]   getting you will get great satisfaction out of producing these really good tours.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:24.220]   So if you gather all this information and then you're hiring, you're paying 200 bucks
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.060]   to an online contractor to then put it all together digitally in the right format so
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.900]   that you don't have to spend 30 hours trying to figure out how to do that.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.340]   I think that's a very good investment of money, those type of strategic investments.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.660]   So that would be my guess.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.740]   Quality over quantity is the way to build not only towards a book, but just to enjoy
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.140]   this as you go along.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.540]   But none of this is possible unless you leave haphazard business and really feel like you
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.340]   have your arms around your day job.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.100]   You have that productivity framework in place.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.380]   I don't know what other channels people use, Jesse.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.940]   If you were, I mean, there's sort of people who've been grandfathered into just having
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.020]   their own blogs like Marginalia, which used to be Brain Pickings.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.980]   I think Tim Urban with Wait But Why.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.060]   Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.060]   I don't know.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.580]   Starting from scratch though, it's difficult, I think.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.580]   I agree with you.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.580]   I think you need multiple mediums.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.940]   I think the key is just don't let your professional use of a medium be your excuse to have your
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.020]   personal life devolve into consuming that medium.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.580]   It's like you can do the Ryan Holiday thing and have stoic quotes on Twitter, Instagram
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.440]   photos of these sort of like cool places you are, these videos that you've made without
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.420]   actually being on Twitter yourself and reading what other people said, without actually being
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.940]   on Instagram and scrolling it all the time.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.380]   So there's definitely a professional mindset that I think helps there.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.340]   You can also, I mean, he was saying how he wanted to work on his writing.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.860]   You can also do that with both mediums for sure.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:54.140]   Yeah, and I'm not as worried as he seems to be in sharpening his writing skills because
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.500]   he's a full-time teacher with a background in journalism and the type of writing he's
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.380]   doing is describing history for a walking tour.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.340]   I'm sure he's perfectly capable of doing that.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.780]   His craft is where it needs to be.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:12.060]   If he was a 22-year-old college student who has never really written professional before,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.360]   okay, you got to get some training to get above that amateur bar.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.060]   He's already well above that amateur bar and the writing he's doing is not, the value in
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.940]   what he's doing is not in the quality of the writing.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.540]   It just has to be non-amateur writing.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.060]   I bet he can already do that.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060]   Yeah, good point.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.820]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.620]   All right, next question is from Ruby, a 35-year-old banker from London.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.500]   I'm taking a few weeks off to recover from burnout due to a period where my responsibilities
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   kept increasing.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.580]   What would you recommend to do to make the most of my time away from work?
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:48.380]   So Ruby, the productivity perspective here is that if all you do during your time off
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:54.260]   is recharge and then just go back into this environment where you were before, give it
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.740]   six months, you'll be back in the same place.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.500]   What is important here, this is what I would do with my time off, is figure out what is
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:09.660]   the productivity framework I'm going to put in place so that I have clarity into all of
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.700]   the obligations entering my world.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.420]   None of it is being held only in my mind.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.420]   I am configuring.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.000]   I can see what it is.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.520]   What type of work do I have at different parts?
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.300]   This is the traditional facing the productivity dragon.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.480]   And then I control my time on different timescales.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   Here's what I'm doing today.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   Here's what I'm doing this week.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.700]   Here's how these projects fit.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.180]   Now here's the goal here.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:37.340]   Not that with this productivity framework, you can optimize your time enough that the
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.500]   workload that burnt you out before you can now handle, that's not the goal.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.380]   The goal instead is clarity.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.420]   Clarity about what's on your plate.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.780]   Clarity about what is reasonable to be on your plate.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.180]   Clarity about proposing this, this, and this makes sense.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.780]   This, this, and this is too much.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.540]   The productivity system, a good productivity system can give you the confidence you need
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.300]   to advocate for yourself.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.820]   Now again, this I think is one of the, one of the insidious side effects of rejecting
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.020]   productivity because you associate it with this optimization over our culture is that
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.780]   ironically it is exactly what your employer wants you to do.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.980]   We think about it, oh no, the productivity is somehow part of this base superstructure
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:30.860]   sort of early 20th century Marxist approach of, of trying to exploit more labor from the,
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.900]   from the, the, the proletariat or something like this.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.900]   Right?
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.380]   So we have this sort of grad school, blah, blah, blah approach to it.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:45.460]   Clarity, knowing what you're doing, knowing what's on your plate, having a extreme clarity
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:51.100]   about exactly your workplace, seeing the matrix of the obligations being thrown at you with
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.500]   clarity.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.220]   That's actually what in a lot of these overwhelmed situations, your employer wouldn't want, because
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.720]   it means you can come back and say, I know this is crazy.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.860]   We need to cut this in half.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.900]   Let me tell you why.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.820]   You know, I have my arms around everything and I'm very careful.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.180]   I run my schedule very carefully and I do very good work.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.460]   This is 50% too much.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.500]   And I have confidence in that conviction.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:17.620]   If you instead fall back into haphazard busyness because you're trying to reject the, the hustle
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:22.220]   culture, et cetera, you are at the mercy of these employers.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.260]   It's just all stuff.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.260]   We're all busy.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   You got a bunch of stuff.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.260]   Why aren't you doing work?
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.260]   Why are you complaining?
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.300]   You're either going to burn yourself out again and again, or give them an excuse to fire
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.940]   you.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   So productivity can actually be what you need to prevent and push back against overload.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   Right?
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.980]   So this is again, the whole autonomy frame for productivity is having your arms around
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.900]   your obligations is what allows you to do so many different things.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.060]   And this is one of the things you can do is it allows you to stand up, allows you to stand
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.300]   up and say with a clear voice and conviction enough, this is too much.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.920]   I know it's too much.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.220]   You know that I know that now.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.860]   This is my, this is what's reasonable and this is what I'm going to do.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.340]   And when people know that you have your act together, when it comes to these sort of productivity
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.540]   systems, it's much harder for them to push back against that.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:15.380]   So that's what I would say, rest and recharge, but also get your systems fired up so that
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.580]   when you come back, you're no longer at the mercy of like whatever junk your employer
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.060]   is just throwing at you and hoping you won't notice that it's completely unreasonable.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.300]   I like what you said at the end of the deep dive too, about having options.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.860]   And that's the autonomy frame.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.420]   If you don't have control over all the different obligations orbiting you and your professional
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:41.500]   life, you are at the mercy of whim, your boss's mood, your personality, what you can get away
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.620]   with and basically we'll probably just be stressed out.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.500]   I mean, or you could be okay.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:50.860]   Like maybe you just, whatever, become kind of misanthropic and, and resentful and people
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.980]   that want to deal with it and you kind of find a way to make it work, but it's all just,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.260]   you're drifting towards some sort of steady state.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.980]   There's probably going to be a non-optimal equilibrium, but when you know everything
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.300]   that's going on, you can stand back and say this, this, and this is the problem.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.420]   And if I move this, I can't do those.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.580]   I got to take this off my plate and no, no, no.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.980]   Of course, no, of course, no, of course, no.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   Yes, I'll do this.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.980]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   I mean, it just makes all the difference.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.900]   You can do so much if you have a good productivity system and you can't do almost anything without
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.900]   it.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:24.100]   I mean, you're just left with like, I'm burnt out or I'm quitting the workforce and hoping
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.740]   that people subscribe to my sub stack.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.820]   There's got to be something in between those two.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.820]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.820]   What do we have next?
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.100]   All right.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.940]   Next question's from Rito, 23 year old from India.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.060]   I have too many interests in my life.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.440]   I have so many choices.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.260]   It's crippling and I end up doing nothing.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.500]   My question is how do I learn to prioritize?
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.260]   So Rito, I included this question because it helps show that the productivity perspective
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.260]   is also relevant to your life outside of work.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.420]   It's also relevant to your leisure life.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.100]   So haphazard busyness can cripple you like it's happening here in your leisure life in
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.540]   the same way that it can in your professional life, especially like Rito, you're young,
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.100]   you're 23 years old, you have all this time and all this potential.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.380]   And there's so many different things you can do that you bounce from one thing to another
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.220]   and nothing's making progress.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:18.500]   Your brain will eventually stop trying to generate motivation.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.140]   I've written about this before, Rito.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.380]   What's really happening here, if you want my opinion, is that our brain is very good
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.060]   at evaluating potential plans.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.620]   Is this objective worth it?
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.500]   And do I have reason to believe this plan is going to work?
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.660]   Our brain asks and answers those two questions all the time.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.900]   We're very good at that.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.260]   This is something that is bred into our paleolithic path.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.380]   Those mechanisms, when it doesn't trust you really know what you're doing, when it doesn't
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.320]   trust that there's a plan here that makes sense, that's going to lead to some sort of
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.940]   mastery or a highly fulfilling outcome.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.000]   It says, nope.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.260]   And what does it feel like when your plan evaluation apparatus in your brain says, no,
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.580]   it feels like procrastination.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.600]   You can't summon motivation because there is a system in our brain that generates the
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.500]   feelings of motivation towards action.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.300]   It has to believe what you're doing.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:12.660]   So if your leisure life is crippled with or ridden with haphazard busyness, it's like,
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:18.400]   I'm not going to just start this whatever by a video camera to become the next Martin
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.720]   Scorsese, because you don't know what you're doing here.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   There's no plan here.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.560]   This is one of like 15 different things you have.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.720]   That is why you have this feeling of, I can't do anything.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   I feel crippled.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   It's because it's too haphazard.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   It's too busy.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.800]   So you can bring a productivity framework into your leisure life to get your arms around
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.960]   this, to start to be selective, to start to be intentional about what you spend your time
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.120]   on and in doing so, you're going to end up in a much better place.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.700]   So let me give you a particular suggestion here, Rito, just to plant a seed.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:51.840]   So one way you might structure more intentionally your life outside of work would be a four
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.840]   part focus.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.100]   I've talked about this before.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.480]   Three routines and one project in one time.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.960]   So the three routines that just figure out how to have going in the background would
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.580]   probably be some sort of fitness health routine.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.500]   This is eating and exercise.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.660]   This is foundational.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.740]   Let's get that going.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.380]   Some sort of reading routine.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.940]   I'm reading on a regular basis.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.580]   I'm moving away from just distraction.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:21.060]   My mind is learning how to actually remain focused on complex thoughts.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.740]   You're going to develop as a human being.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.300]   You're going to develop as a, as a thinker.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.260]   We did a podcast episode a few weeks ago on how to become a reader.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.900]   It was called the joys of the reading life.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.140]   It's probably like two 38.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.140]   Episode two 38.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.140]   So go back and watch that.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.100]   Your third routine, I would say to put in place foundationally is some sort of community
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.660]   routine.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.340]   These things you do on a regular basis that keep you connected and serving your friends,
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.700]   your family, other people in the communities that you're involved with.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.780]   Get background routines for those three things going.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.780]   That's just foundational.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.000]   You can tweak those, but you should always on a regular basis.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.700]   Those things are just woven into the fabric of your life.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.700]   Okay.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.100]   And then one major project.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.060]   And then do that major project till you get to a great milestone and you can swap in another
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.580]   major project.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.900]   So just one major project at a time, spend six months on it, spend a year on it.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.900]   I don't really care.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.460]   You're young, you're 23.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.140]   You have more time than you think.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.660]   So this is just one particular suggestions of how you might establish a more intentional
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.860]   approach to your leisure life.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.580]   But having routines for the things that are foundational to a life well live and then
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:30.420]   pursuing one thing at a time until a good point, giving that your full attention.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.420]   That for example, works really well.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.260]   And it's the type of thing that you're not going to get to until you get more intentional
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.260]   about your time.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.260]   All right.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.260]   We're making progress here.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.260]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.940]   I like this question.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.460]   Next question is from Jonas, a 32 year old research analyst.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:52.100]   I'm trying to decide whether a ditch postpone a side hustle idea in order not to overwhelm
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:59.020]   myself versus adopting a slow part productivity mindset and see how progress compounds over
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.020]   time.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.220]   So Jonas, what you need is extreme clarity.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:06.120]   And this is where the productivity perspective is going to help you.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.620]   You have to get your arms around the job that's making you feel busy right now.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.740]   Capture configure control.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.500]   See where you can get that.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.140]   You reduce the stress, take control of your time.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.340]   Begin with the configure step to be more aggressive about workload management.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.140]   See where you can get that line in a place that's allowing you to do what you need to
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.620]   do without feeling overwhelmed.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:32.340]   And then step back and say, where would the side hustle fit?
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.660]   And answer that question honestly.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.380]   And now Jonas, knowing what I know about you, because in your elaboration, you talked a
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.180]   little bit more about your busyness and you have a lot of going a lot of things going
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.620]   on with your family and young kids.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:48.980]   When you step back, you might say, there is not time for me to execute a reasonable plan
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   for the side hustle.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   And you know what?
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   That's fine.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   Don't do the side hustle.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.700]   But you're going to get that answer with clarity.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.940]   Or after you capture configure control, you might really tame your job.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.420]   And so you know what, I could work on this two days a week, three hours in the morning,
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:07.580]   it's my remote work days, nothing really gets going until noon or whatever.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.820]   And this would allow me and here's my plan.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.060]   And I could actually make pretty good progress on this.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.700]   And then you might find like, okay, now I see exactly where I'm going to work on this.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.380]   And I'm looking at exactly where I'm going to work on this.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.060]   And this is enough time.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.940]   And this is worth it enough to me, let's do it.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.420]   But you cannot get to these answers with confidence unless you really know what's going on with
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.540]   your current work obligations.
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.060]   And so that's what I want you to do.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:35.740]   Pull out capture configure control until you are a master of your job, then work through
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.980]   what are the reasonable scenarios for me to make progress on the side hustle and evaluate
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980]   those?
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.460]   Will it work?
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.520]   And is it worth it?
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.320]   Is where the achievement the side hustle would generate?
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.980]   Is it worth it for what I would have to do and be very honest with you answer it and
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.460]   especially at this stage of life, you have young kids at home, it's completely fine for
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.460]   your answer there just be no, it's not worth it.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.540]   I've controlled my job.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.880]   I like having this flexibility.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.220]   I want to just use this to do more things in my family or a hobby.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.580]   I think that's a completely reasonable solution as well.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.100]   But you don't get those options till you know what's going on.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.540]   You're just haphazardly busy, good luck.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.500]   You're just going to start doing the side hustle that in a way that you don't have time
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.460]   for this going to cause stress, you're going to let it peter out.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.540]   So again, the productivity perspective here says once you have control, you get autonomy,
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.180]   autonomy gives you options.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.540]   I actually thought when I first read the question, I thought that he had already started the
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.340]   side hustle and you know, I was working on it for a while.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.700]   And then, you know, it's a little hard to tell.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.140]   I read the longer one.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.060]   He talked a lot about the various things that were he was worried about like his busyness
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.660]   and there definitely was a sense of haphazard busyness.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.700]   Yeah, but it was a little unclear if he had started and it was feeling overwhelmed by
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.060]   it already or if he was pretty sure that if I just started this, I'd feel overwhelmed.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:54.100]   I mean, the slow productivity approach, it can work with a side hustle, but you really
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.100]   got to evaluate it.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.100]   Right.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.420]   So you could say like, at some point it's too slow.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.180]   If it's I'm going to work once a month, I'm going to have an hour session like that's
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.180]   too slow.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.940]   I mean, to me, slow productivity also involves obsessing over quality.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.220]   It also involves the reduction of things.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.920]   You can give more attention to something.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.240]   It's not just about you can fit another thing into your schedule because if you stretch
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.340]   it out long enough, you can find little pockets of time to make progress.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.260]   I mean, slow productivity is it's a lot of it's about simplification.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.940]   So it can take more of your attention.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.940]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:29.060]   Obsession over quality so that you can really come at it again and again.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.980]   I think just trying to spread something out.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.740]   So you touch it here and there.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.180]   It's not really a slow, productive approach.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.580]   I think it's just a fragmented approach.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.580]   All right.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.580]   Let's try to fit in one more question here.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.580]   All right.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.700]   Next question is from Andrew, 51 year old biology professor.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.500]   I'm a professor because research production is not a shared goal.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:53.620]   I have difficulty getting my colleagues to think creatively about system changes, even
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.840]   if we might benefit from it all.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.920]   It's always easier to do what is easiest in the immediate moment.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.940]   Other folks productivity be damned.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.940]   What should I do?
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.380]   Well, I included this question in part just because I like professor questions, but it's
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:11.780]   another good example for us to apply the productivity perspective.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.820]   So what Andrew's talking about is the type of collaboration systems I detail and motivate
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:23.020]   in my book, A World Without Email, where I talk about in the knowledge work context,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.940]   there's many informal collaboration styles that are built mainly around haphazard back
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.020]   and forth messaging that are actually really unproductive for everyone involved in the
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.780]   long term, even though in the moment it's easier just to shoot off a quick email than
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.780]   it is to actually implement some sort of collaboration system, like whatever.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.620]   There's a shared document where the thoughts go.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:47.260]   And on Monday night, I review that and then I put the notes using track changes and you
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.500]   have till Wednesday, close a business to react to them.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.960]   And then we have a standing meeting on Thursday morning.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.340]   Those type of systems get you away from constant back and forth messaging, but they're a little
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.940]   bit more work in the moment.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.460]   Andrew was saying, I can't get fellow professors to do this because we're not all working towards
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.740]   the shared same goal.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.660]   It's not everyone in my department is working on getting this new product out.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.660]   We're each working on our own thing.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:17.580]   And so we're not that interested in being collectively focused on improving how we collaborate.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:24.100]   So Andrew, my productivity perspective here is you have to shift the scope that you're
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.160]   thinking about productivity.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:34.240]   If you are a professor at a research institution, you need to think about yourself as a standalone
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.900]   business.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.820]   The other professors in your department and other professors that you interact with and
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:45.780]   other departments, the HR department, the whatever, like other, whatever you would call
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.740]   them groups within university, like their own businesses with which you have various
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.740]   professional relationships.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.700]   You're Ford and you work with Firestone tires.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.380]   They're two separate businesses, but you guys have a contract and a relationship that get
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.020]   the tires for your car manufacturing plant, but you're not the same company.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.340]   So you have to think of yourself almost as like a standalone silo.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.100]   So when you're thinking about systems internally is where you're really trying to get a handle
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.100]   on what is my work, what do I work on?
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.100]   What are my quotas?
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.100]   What do I not do?
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.100]   When do I get this work done?
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.580]   How much time do I have available?
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.780]   How do I want to use this time?
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.700]   And you're keeping track of all that and have all your complex systems.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.700]   Then when you're interacting with the rest of the world, it's well, you have sort of
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.020]   interfaces with interacting with these other standalone entities.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.540]   And I don't know, they're bothering you with emails.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.780]   You could just do what you need to do with that.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:42.060]   Just process centric emailing might work there where you never formally develop a new collaboration
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.100]   system with someone else.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.700]   You just sort of tell them in your response.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.700]   Yeah, great.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.100]   We should think about this.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.620]   Put any thoughts you have in this Google doc that I started.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.860]   I will review it.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.820]   If I have any questions because you're a professor, I know you have clearly posted office hours.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:02.220]   I will actually just come to your office hours next week and we'll talk about it.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.100]   So you just sort of put a process into the communication and there it is.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.260]   You're not calling it a process.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.340]   You're not negotiating about it.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.180]   You're just saying it.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.720]   Certain types of work like this is very disruptive.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.860]   This person just constantly wants to email things.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.540]   Okay, I'm not doing that.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.020]   I'm not going to work on that person.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.020]   I'm going to leave that committee.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.020]   You have all this autonomy.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.660]   This is like a company saying we're going to get out of selling at souls because there's
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.660]   not a lot of profit there.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:30.300]   We're going to focus more on, you know, selling Ford focuses or whatever.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:35.140]   You think of yourself like a standalone business that interfaces with other organizations and
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.940]   you do your best to keep those interfaces as non-disruptive as possible.
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.740]   So you need to be more ruthless, Andrew.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.700]   That's I guess what I would say.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.860]   Your department is not your team members.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.020]   They're your colleagues.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.020]   You're collegial to them.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:54.460]   You enjoy them, but you're all your own standalone entities trying to figure out how to exist
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:01.620]   in the same academic sphere while still accomplishing your internal objectives.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.260]   So I don't know, maybe, maybe I'm being a little bit Darwinian there, but I think it's
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.900]   the best academia really is.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.900]   It's entrepreneurial.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.900]   You're trying to produce original research.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.900]   That's the whole game.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.020]   If you don't, you get fired.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.700]   That's the whole game.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.700]   And you work with other people.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.420]   There's other things you have to do and service you have to do.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.260]   But, but it's just like Ford has these other things they have to do, but ultimately if
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.060]   they're not selling cars, they're out of business.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:27.100]   You kind of have to keep that in mind.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.100]   I like it.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.100]   All right.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:33.140]   So I like at least once a month to talk about the books I read the month before.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.300]   So we're going to do that in our final segment, the books I read in February, 2023.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.940]   Before we do, let me just quickly mention another one of our long time sponsors.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.920]   That is our friends at Blinkist.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:52.160]   As I've said before, if you enjoy a reading life, so if like I recommend you make reading
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:59.860]   books an important part of your development as a human being, Blinkist is a great assistant,
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.380]   a great whatever you want to call it, sidecar to this pursuit.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.380]   Here's how it works.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:11.380]   It's a subscription service that gives you short 15 minute summaries of thousands over
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.380]   5,000 different nonfiction books and podcasts.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.420]   These 15 minute summaries you can listen to, or you can read.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.220]   They're called Blinks.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:25.340]   Now the way I recommend using Blinkist to support the reading life is to use it to help
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:30.380]   triage which of the tens of thousands of books that are out there do you actually want to
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.760]   invest your time in the reading.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.560]   So if you're interested in a particular book, read the Blink, listen to the Blink.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.660]   You will know, trust me, I've done this a lot.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.660]   Jesse's a big user of Blinkist.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.660]   He's done this a lot.
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:48.340]   The 15 minute summary teaches you really clearly, oh yes, I need to get this book, or I kind
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.340]   of got the gist.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.740]   I'm glad I didn't actually start reading this book and aborted on it.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:57.940]   So it's like you're a sidekick for trying to figure out what books you want to read.
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.540]   And the advantage is all of the books you read the Blink of that you decide not to actually
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:07.700]   buy and read, you still learn the main ideas and the terminologies and the frameworks.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.260]   You can file that away and use it when you then encounter a book that you're reading
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.540]   in its full details.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.660]   You know, hey, these five other books I decided not to buy.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.020]   I know the main ideas and frameworks.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.500]   And when I'm reading this book, I have this foundation.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.940]   So it really is a great accelerant to the reading life.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:29.020]   I also want to mention they have a new feature called Blinkist Connect right now, which is
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:33.420]   a two for the price of one feature in which you can, with your subscription to Blinkist,
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.780]   get an extra subscription that you can give to a friend.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.420]   So if you have a friend who's also trying to engage in the reading life and you're joining
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:45.700]   Blinkist, you can pass on a subscription to them as well.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.260]   So right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.300]   And now for a limited time, you can even use Blinkist Connect to share your premium account.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:17.780]   You will get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:23.180]   I also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.700]   If you don't use a VPN, you should.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.160]   Trust me, I'm a computer scientist.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:34.400]   If you're not using a VPN, people can see what you're doing on the internet, what sites
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.140]   and services you can talk to.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.860]   People who are just nearby when you're connected to a Wi-Fi access point can sniff your packets.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:45.180]   And even if you've encrypted the content of the packets, they see what website or what
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.300]   service you're talking to.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:53.540]   Your internet service provider at home can and probably does also harvest this information
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.620]   to figure out what type of sites or services does the subscriber use.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.300]   And they can sell that information and they do.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.060]   I don't think people realize the degree to which the sites and services you use are being
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.500]   monitored and collected, packaged up and sold.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.100]   A VPN avoids that.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:12.640]   The way it works is when you have a VPN, you connect to the VPN itself.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.700]   You send them an encrypted message saying, here's who I really want to talk to.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.120]   I want to go to Netflix.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.260]   I want to go to calnewport.com.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.860]   And the VPN talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response and
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.000]   send it back to you.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.620]   So what is the person sniffing your Wi-Fi packets, your internet service provider find
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:29.620]   out about you?
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.220]   Only that you're talking to a VPN.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.980]   So they have no idea what you're actually doing on the internet.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:41.100]   If you're going to use a VPN, I suggest the one I use, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.460]   I like them for a lot of reasons.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:47.020]   One, they have servers in over a hundred different locations around the world.
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.980]   So wherever you are in your travels, there's probably a nearby ExpressVPN server you can
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.220]   connect to.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.660]   Nearby is good because that means a faster connection.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.080]   They have a lot of bandwidth.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:00.980]   You get very high bandwidth connections with these servers and their software is very easy
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   to use.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.480]   You can put it on any of the devices you use to connect to the internet.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.820]   They click a button.
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.480]   Now you're going through a VPN and you just use everything like normal.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.700]   Use everything like normal, but now it's going automatically through the VPN.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.100]   So you need a VPN.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.900]   ExpressVPN is the one that I recommend.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:28.780]   So be smart, protect your data and gain more privacy at ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.580]   Don't forget to use my link at ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:40.340]   If you include that /deep, you'll get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.260]   All right, final segment.
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.780]   The five books I read in February 2023.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:49.680]   As long time listeners know, I try to read five books a month and I report on what those
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.820]   books are here on the podcast.
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.000]   All right, so what did I read in February?
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.540]   Number one, The Clockwork Universe by Edward Dolnick.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:08.300]   This was roughly speaking a popular history of the Royal Society in London.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:16.420]   More generally speaking, it was a book about the rise of the Enlightenment scientific mindset.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.460]   Dolnick makes this point, but a lot of other authors make this point as well.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.560]   Isaac Newton was at a turning point.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.860]   Isaac Newton was born and came up in a world that was connected more to Greek thought and
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.940]   mythological thought.
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:33.760]   And by the time he died, we were in a world that had a more empirical mathematical approach
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.540]   to understanding the world.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.820]   I love these type of histories.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.040]   It's a very readable book, short chapters, it moves pretty quick.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.860]   Not as deep as some other histories I've read on this, but had a lot of good information.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:48.020]   So a lot of London in this episode.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:50.020]   Two questions from London.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.020]   Two questions from London.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.020]   A book about London.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.020]   You know why?
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.140]   It's because I am...
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:55:00.340]   That article we talked about last week in the Financial Times, obviously that's a London-based
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.340]   publication.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.980]   So last week I was killing it in the UK.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:11.780]   So this podcast, number one technology podcast in the UK, number 30 overall podcast in the
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   UK.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:18.420]   Deep Work at Amazon UK was ranked 60.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.420]   That's so good.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:20.420]   Right?
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.420]   So we've been killing it in the UK.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.340]   So as you can see, we're pushing all of our content to be UK-centric.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.540]   There's a lot of good golf courses around London.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.260]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.700]   We need a podcast out of there.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:31.700]   All right.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.420]   I also read Wandering Home by Bill McKibben.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.900]   I read that years and years ago, but I had a copy in my library.
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.100]   So I went back and read it and loved it.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.100]   Very nostalgic.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.500]   I really remember reading that book in grad school.
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.060]   Bill McKibben, who I really like, I interviewed him for a New Yorker piece a couple of years
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.060]   ago.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:53.880]   He wrote this cool book where he walked from his house in Ripton, Vermont, which is sort
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:56:00.980]   of one valley over from Lake Champlain in Western Vermont, to his house in the Adirondacks.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:07.460]   So the McKibben story is that he quit the New Yorker and moved to a cabin.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.580]   It was really like a rundown house.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:15.220]   Him and his wife, Susan Halperin, who's an excellent journalist, they moved to this house
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.500]   in the Adirondacks.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:20.220]   And then once they had their kid, they realized kids need a school to go to.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.820]   So they moved across Lake Champlain to Ripton, Vermont, which I actually visited there last
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:24.820]   summer.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.420]   It's one south of Lincoln.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:32.060]   It's these cool green mountain towns that are up at elevation and really quaint.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:37.700]   Anyways, he walked from Ripton to the old house in the Adirondacks.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:42.020]   He had someone row him across Lake Champlain.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:47.180]   And in doing so, he visited all these places and talked a lot about the type of things
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.580]   he writes about in Deep Economy.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:52.100]   Is that the book?
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.380]   Deep Economy.
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.380]   Sustainable commercial endeavor, etc.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.180]   It was a really cool book, really nostalgic.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:05.220]   Makes you want to just move to Vermont and drink Otter Creek beer and hang out at Middlebury.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:09.420]   Another book I read, you'd appreciate this one, Jesse, America's Game by Michael McCambridge,
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.420]   the history of the NFL.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.420]   It's a long book.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:18.220]   I read it for, I'm in a dad book group that only reads sports books.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:23.740]   Just a lot of journalists and stuff that we don't want to read anything that's too close
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   to our work.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.420]   Anything that's too close to home, so we read sports books.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   I like that.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:34.940]   I know a lot about the history of the NFL now, at least up until 2005, that's when this
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:35.940]   book came out.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:41.740]   In the early days, back during Lombardi, the Canadian Football League was a big, it was
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:42.940]   a definite competitor.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:43.940]   People would go over there and-
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.100]   That's not mentioned at all in this book.
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.100]   Really?
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.060]   I read his historian on earlier in the week and they were actually talking about that
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.420]   because somebody died.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:59.060]   Michael McCambridge, man, you missed the big storyline here.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:05.260]   I also read The Conquest of Happiness by Bertrand Russell.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.220]   The philosopher, mathematician Bertrand Russell wrote this book.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.620]   This would have been in like 19, I think it's like 1919 or something like that, maybe 1930,
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.700]   somewhere in that period, maybe a little later than that.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:18.940]   I might be messing it up.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.780]   He died remarkably late.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:22.780]   He lived a long time.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:24.780]   I'm going to say the 1930s.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:29.460]   Anyways, there's a really nice new edition of this book that I found at Barnes & Noble.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.100]   I was like, "Okay, I got to read this."
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:36.820]   It's kind of like a self-help book, but written before people wrote self-help books and written
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.100]   by an eminent philosopher and mathematician.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.180]   It's him trying to deconstruct and understand the sources of human happiness as well as
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.780]   the things that pull away from human happiness and trying to lay out some sort of program
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.620]   for how you can maximize it in your life.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.340]   This is what philosophers used to do.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:58.220]   This is why I really dislike this tendency we have for, especially the very online types,
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:02.540]   to be very dismissive about, well, their self-help.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   They're a guru.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.740]   Where you have to throw this disclaimer at the front of everything you write.
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.580]   You're like, "I'm no guru.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:13.860]   In fact, I'm terrible and I can barely walk and I'm not giving any advice."
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:17.540]   You really think people are going to applaud, like there's all these gurus who are preying
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.540]   on people.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.180]   But look, it used to be professional thinkers and philosophers were like, "This is one of
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:26.380]   the things I want to do, is try to think through big questions from life and take my swing."
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.020]   So good for Russell for doing it.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.260]   Very readable.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:32.900]   There's some anachronisms in it, but actually otherwise reads as a pretty modern book.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.020]   >> RUSSELL: A lot of similar concepts to the deep life stuff that you talk about?
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.020]   >> DAVE: There's some, yeah.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.020]   I mean, I get- >> RUSSELL: Like getting outside.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:44.100]   >> DAVE: There's that stuff, but also a lot of psychological stuff like jealousy and pride
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.100]   and trying to understand.
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.100]   It's interesting.
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.060]   So it's kind of mental healthy, a lot of it.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.100]   The habits of mind that can really pull you down.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.900]   I mean, it actually reads pretty relevant, but it is an issue of mine.
[00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:01.460]   It's this like, I'm not impressed by people who have to put these long disclaimers about
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.900]   like, "I'm not a guru who's going to tell you exactly how to live your life."
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:09.420]   I mean, where are these gurus who are trying to tell people exactly how to live their life?
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.740]   I think smart people should take swings at, "Here's a big question.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.340]   Let me take a swing at how you might answer it."
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.620]   People are smart.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.820]   They will adapt it to their own circumstances.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.540]   They will discount the obvious caveats.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   This weird, whatever it is, negative reaction that sort of very online elite types have
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:36.860]   to trying to be instructive or like to tackle big questions.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.540]   I don't think it's healthy.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:43.140]   It's similar in sports how they always say, "Oh, the naysayers say X, Y, Z."
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.860]   I think in online culture, it's very safe to be a naysayer because you'd be applauded
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.260]   for your world weary critiques.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.780]   People are like, "Oh, that's a good, I didn't see that angle of critique."
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.780]   And there's no real risk.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.660]   Yeah, being a little bit too critical.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.520]   They're like, "Well, you know, sophisticated people are critical."
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:03.420]   But you're really opening yourself up if you say, "This is my thoughts about this," or
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.660]   like, "This is my philosophy for how you should do something."
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:09.700]   I mean, I think it's why I've sold a lot of books is because I'm not online, so I don't
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.700]   care.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.620]   It's like, "Look, I think this is interesting.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.660]   I loved reading this stuff.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.460]   I love books like Bertrand Russell's Conquest of Happiness.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.700]   Let's just get after it."
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.220]   And I don't care.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.780]   So I guess more books for me if everyone else is afraid of it.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.220]   A lot of smart people who could be writing really interesting, cool, reflective books
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.100]   aren't because they don't want to get yelled at on Twitter.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.960]   So hey, more books for us.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.520]   Final book I read, part of this is kind of a holdover from Thriller December, Rising
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.560]   Sun by Michael Crichton.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.360]   I'm sure I read that at some point when I was a kid, but I found the paperback in a
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.880]   used paperback, and so I read it.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.040]   Well-constructed sort of murder mystery thriller.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.040]   It's two detectives.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.880]   I saw a movie about this with Sean Connery and God, who was the other person?
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.880]   Was it Wesley Snipes?
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.880]   I think it was.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.160]   I saw that movie like 30 years ago.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   I have to go back and watch the movie.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.640]   I mean, essentially, it's a detective thriller, right?
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.280]   These are detectives, and they're trying to figure out a murder, and then there's some
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.120]   like Crichton high-tech stuff.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.200]   The thing I didn't really realize this about Crichton until more recently, he got really
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   reactionary.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.960]   This is like a pretty reactionary kind of anti-Japanese book.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960]   Oh, really?
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.800]   Like he was very worried, clearly very worried about the economic influence of, then I guess
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.960]   Japan had this massive outsized economic influence.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.800]   Not very nice to Japanese people.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.160]   I'm thinking about disclosure.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.280]   I'm thinking about state of fear.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.760]   I was like, "Oh, he kind of became curmudgeonly in his 90s."
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.560]   So it is pretty reactionary.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.480]   He just works this stuff into his book, but still a good murder mystery.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.400]   But it's an interesting layer.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.160]   Any of these books audio?
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   I'm sure they're all...
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160]   No, none of these were audio.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.160]   So you read them all?
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160]   I read them all.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.160]   Yeah, I've been doing a lot of audio books recently.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   All right.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.420]   Well, anyways, that's what I've got, Jesse.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.440]   So thank you everyone for watching or listening.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.080]   Today's episode, we'll be back next week with another full episode of the show.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.960]   Until then, as always, stay deep.
