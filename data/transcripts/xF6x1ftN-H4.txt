[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   The following is a conversation with Neil Ferguson,
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.960]   one of the great historians of our time,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.660]   at times controversial and always brilliant,
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.800]   whether you agree with him or not.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.960]   He's an author of 16 books on topics
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.240]   covering the history of money, power, war,
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.440]   pandemics, and empire.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.360]   Previously at Harvard, currently at Stanford,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.920]   and today launching a new university here in Austin, Texas
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.720]   called the University of Austin,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.840]   a new institution built from the ground up
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.520]   to encourage open inquiry and discourse
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.240]   by both thinkers and doers,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.120]   from philosophers and historians
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.200]   to scientists and engineers,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.900]   embracing debate, dissent, and self-examination,
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.880]   free to speak, to disagree, to think,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.760]   to explore truly novel ideas.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.080]   The advisory board includes Steven Pinker,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.180]   Jonathan Haidt, and many other amazing people,
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.560]   with one exception, me.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.240]   I was graciously invited to be on the advisory board,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.320]   which I accepted in the hope of doing my small part
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.040]   in helping build the future of education and open discourse,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.480]   especially in the fields of artificial intelligence,
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.200]   robotics, and computing.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.440]   We spend the first hour of this conversation
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.560]   talking about this new university
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.880]   before switching to talking about
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.160]   some of the darkest moments in human history
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.640]   and what they reveal about human nature.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.920]   in the description.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.800]   And now, here's my conversation with Neil Ferguson.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.260]   You are one of the great historians of our time,
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.100]   respected, sometimes controversial.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.160]   You have flourished in some of the best universities
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   in the world, from NYU to London School of Economics
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.480]   to Harvard, and now to Hoover Institution at Stanford.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.220]   Before we talk about the history of money, war, and power,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.740]   let us talk about a new university.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.720]   You're a part of launching here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   It is called University of Austin, UATX.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.100]   What is its mission, its goals, its plan?
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.960]   - I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of people
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.600]   in higher education that there's a problem.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.480]   And that problem manifests itself
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.080]   in a great many different ways.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.800]   But I would sum up the problem as being
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   a drastic chilling of the atmosphere
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.520]   that constrains free speech, free exchange,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.760]   even free thought.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.640]   And I had never anticipated that this would happen
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.460]   in my lifetime.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.160]   My academic career began in Oxford in the 1980s
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.600]   when anything went.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.040]   One sensed that a university was a place
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.320]   where one could risk saying the unsayable.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   And debate the undebatable.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.640]   So the fact that in a relatively short space of time,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.120]   a variety of ideas, critical race theory, or wokeism,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.960]   whatever you want to call it,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.560]   a variety of ideas have come along that seek to limit,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.040]   and quite drastically limit what we can talk about,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.580]   strikes me as deeply unhealthy.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.500]   And I'm not sure, and I've thought about this
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.880]   for a long time, you can fix it
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.700]   with the existing institutions.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.060]   I think you need to create a new one.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.000]   And so after much deliberation, we decided to do it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And I think it's a hugely timely opportunity
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080]   to do what people used to do in this country,
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.640]   which was to create new institutions.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.520]   I mean, that used to be the default setting of America.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.600]   We sort of stopped doing that.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   I mean, I look back and I thought,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840]   why are there no new universities?
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.960]   Or at least, if there are,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.080]   why do they have so little impact?
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.000]   It seems like we have the billionaires,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.460]   we have the need, let's do it.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.960]   - So you still believe in institutions, in the university,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.060]   in the ideal of the university?
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.220]   - I believe passionately in that ideal.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.740]   There's a reason they've been around
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.780]   for nearly a millennium.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.620]   There is a unique thing that happens
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.980]   on a university campus when it's done right.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.580]   And that is the transfer of knowledge between generations.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.300]   That is a very sacred activity,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.840]   and it seems to withstand major changes in technology.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.200]   So this form that we call the university
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.280]   predates the printing press,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.620]   survived the printing press,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.080]   continued to function through the scientific revolution,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   the enlightenment, the industrial revolution to this day.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.320]   And I think it's because,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.580]   maybe because of evolutionary psychology,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.580]   we need to be together in one relatively confined space
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.860]   when we're in our late teens and early twenties
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.240]   for the knowledge transfer
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.340]   between the generations to happen.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.220]   That's my feeling about this.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.760]   But in order for it to work well,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.700]   there need to be very few constraints.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.760]   There needs to be a sense
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.920]   that one can take intellectual risk.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.760]   Remember, people in their late teens and early twenties
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.220]   are adults, but they're inexperienced adults.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.700]   And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.680]   saying stupid things was my MO.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.960]   My way to finding good ideas
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.720]   was through a minefield of bad ideas.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.260]   I feel so sorry for people like me today,
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.120]   people age 18, 19, 20 today,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.500]   who are intellectually very curious,
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.980]   ambitious, but inexperienced,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.900]   because the minefields today are absolutely lethal
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.060]   and one wrong foot and it's cancellation.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.380]   I said this to Peter Thiel the other day,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.020]   imagine being us now.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.180]   I mean, we were obnoxious undergraduates.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.500]   There's nothing that Peter did at Stanford
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.380]   that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford,
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.040]   and perhaps we were even worse.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.700]   But it was so not career-ending
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.540]   to be an absolutely insufferable,
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.040]   obnoxious undergraduate then.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.500]   Today, if people like us exist today,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.240]   they must live in a state of constant anxiety
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.860]   that they're going to be outed for some heretical statement
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.260]   that they made five years ago on social media.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.540]   So part of what motivates me is the desire
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   to give the me's of today a shot at free thinking
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.420]   and really, I'd call it,
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.300]   aggressive learning, learning where you're really pushed.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.340]   And I just think that stopped happening
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.180]   on the major campuses,
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.260]   because whether at Harvard where I used to teach
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.720]   or at Stanford where I'm now based,
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self-censorship
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.580]   that means people are afraid
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.500]   to take even minimal risk in class.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.740]   I mean, just take, for example,
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.760]   a survey that was published earlier this year
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.380]   that revealed, this is of undergraduates
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.380]   in four-year programs in the US,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.620]   85% of self-described liberal students
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.780]   said they would report a professor
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.820]   to the university administration
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.780]   if he or she said something they considered offensive.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.560]   And something like 75% said they'd do it
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.080]   to a fellow undergraduate.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.400]   That's the kind of culture that's evolved
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.740]   in our universities.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.760]   So we need a new university in which none of that is true,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.120]   in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.460]   get it completely wrong, and live to tell the tale.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.280]   There's a lot more going on, I think,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.800]   because when you start thinking about what's wrong
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.340]   with a modern university,
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.820]   many, many more things suggest themselves.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.520]   And I think there's an opportunity here
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.980]   to build something that's radically new in some ways
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.140]   and radically traditional in other ways.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.880]   For example, I have a strong preference
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.420]   for the tutorial system that you see
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.780]   at Oxford and Cambridge, which is small group teaching
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.300]   and highly Socratic in its structure.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.660]   I think it'd be great to bring that to the United States
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.780]   where it doesn't really exist.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.320]   But at the same time, I think we should be doing
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.900]   some very 21st century things,
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.140]   making sure that while people are reading
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.620]   and studying classic works,
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.580]   they're also going to be immersed in the real world
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.700]   of technological innovation,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.420]   a world that you know very well.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.260]   And I'd love to get a synthesis
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.660]   of the ancient and classical,
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.300]   which we're gradually letting fade away,
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.540]   with the novel and technological.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.280]   So we wanna produce people
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.600]   who can simultaneously talk intelligently
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   about Adam Smith, or for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.440]   and have a conversation with you about where AI is going
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.920]   and how long it will be before I can get driven here
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.040]   by a self-driving vehicle,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.800]   allowing me to have my lunch and prepare
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.280]   rather than focus on the other crazy people on the road.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.320]   So that's the dream, that we can create something
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.220]   which is partly classical and partly 21st century,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.100]   and we look around and we don't see it.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.980]   If you don't see an institution
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.060]   that you really think should exist,
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.100]   I think you have a more responsibility to create it.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.940]   - So you're thinking including something bigger
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.180]   than just liberal education,
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.060]   also including science, engineering, and technology.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.060]   I should also comment that I mostly stay out of politics
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.640]   and out of some of these aspects of liberal education
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.480]   that's kind of been the most controversial
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.560]   and difficult within the university,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.480]   but there is a kind of ripple effect of fear
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.920]   within that space into science and engineering
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   and technology that I think has a nature
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.160]   that's difficult to describe.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.680]   It doesn't have a controversial nature,
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.360]   it just has a nature of fear,
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.560]   where you're not, you mentioned saying stupid stuff
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.180]   as a young 20-year-old.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.080]   For example, deep learning, machine learning
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.760]   is really popular in the computer science now
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.280]   as an approach for creating
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.880]   artificial intelligence systems.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.720]   It is controversial in that space to say that
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.640]   anything against machine learning,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.460]   saying sort of exploring ideas that's saying
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.120]   this is going to lead to a dead end.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.120]   Now, that takes some guts to do as a young 20-year-old
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.340]   within a classroom, to think like that,
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.720]   to raise that question in a machine learning course.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.360]   It sounds ridiculous, 'cause it's like
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.800]   who's going to complain about this,
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   but the fear that starts in a course on history
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.560]   or some course that covers society,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.940]   the fear ripples and affects those students
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.860]   that are asking big out-of-the-box questions
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.080]   about engineering, about computer science.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.520]   And there's a lot, there's linear algebra
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.220]   that's not going to change,
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.140]   but then there's applied linear algebra,
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.200]   which is machine learning,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.940]   and that's when robots and real systems touch human beings,
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.840]   and that's when you have to ask yourself
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.980]   these difficult questions about humanity,
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.980]   even in the engineering and science and technology courses.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.380]   And these are not separate worlds in two senses.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.020]   I've just taken delivery of my copy of the book
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.580]   that Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.980]   have co-authored on artificial intelligence,
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.600]   the central question of which is
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.620]   what does this mean for us broadly?
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.060]   But they're not separate worlds in C.P. Snow's sense
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.020]   of the chasm between science and arts,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.780]   because on a university campus,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.620]   everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.340]   to the behaviors that are occurring
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.340]   in the English department.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.980]   Those behaviors, if denunciation becomes a norm,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.140]   you know, undergraduate denounces professor,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.060]   teaching assistant denounces undergraduate,
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.820]   those behaviors are contagious and will spread inexorably,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.460]   first to social science and then to natural sciences.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.940]   And I think that's part of the reason why
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.340]   when this started to happen,
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.980]   when we started to get the origins
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.340]   of disinvitation and cancel culture,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.500]   it was not just a few conservative professors
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.280]   in the humanities who had to worry,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.580]   everybody had to worry,
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.580]   because eventually it was going to come
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.580]   even to the most apparently hard stem part of the campus.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.860]   It's contagious.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.860]   This is something Nicholas Christakis should look at,
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.220]   because he's very good at looking at the way
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.100]   in which social networks,
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.840]   like the ones that exist in a university,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.700]   can spread everything.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.540]   But I think when we look back and ask,
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.560]   why did wokeism spread so rapidly
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.600]   and rapidly out of humanities
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.160]   into other parts of universities?
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.580]   And why did it spread across the country
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.600]   and beyond the United States
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.460]   to the other English speaking universities?
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.380]   It's because it's a contagion.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.500]   And these behaviors are contagious.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.060]   The president of a university I won't name
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.740]   said to me that he receives every day
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.520]   at least one denunciation,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.880]   one call for somebody or other to be fired
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.060]   for something that they said.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.880]   That's the crazy kind of totalitarianism light
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.580]   that now exists in our universities.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.740]   And of course, the people who want to downplay this say,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.020]   oh, well, there only have been
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.800]   a hundred and something disinvitations,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.920]   or, oh, there really aren't that many cases.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.400]   But the point is that the famous events,
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.500]   the events that get the attention,
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.020]   are responsible for a general chilling
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.840]   that as you say, spreads to every part of the university
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.780]   and creates a very familiar culture
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.400]   in which people are afraid to say what they think.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.820]   Self-censorship, look at the Heterodox Academy data on this,
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.860]   grows and grows.
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.340]   So now a majority of students will say,
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.940]   this is clear from the latest Heterodox Academy surveys,
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.740]   we are scared to say what we think
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.520]   in case we get denounced, in case we get canceled.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.300]   But that's just not the correct atmosphere
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.980]   for a university in a free society.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.580]   To me, what's really creepy
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.100]   is how many of the behaviors I see
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.740]   on university campuses today
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.380]   are reminiscent of the way that people used to behave
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.580]   in the Soviet Union, or in the Soviet bloc,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.260]   or in Mao's China.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.740]   The sort of totalitarianism light
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   that I think we're contending with here,
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.460]   which manifests itself as denunciations,
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.660]   people informing on superiors,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.820]   some people using it for career advantage,
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.100]   other people reduced to hapless, desperate apology
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.980]   to try to exonerate themselves,
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.460]   people disappearing, metaphorically, if not literally.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.100]   All of this is so reminiscent of the totalitarian regimes
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.760]   that I studied earlier in my career
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.100]   that it makes me feel sick.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.480]   And what makes me really feel sick
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.660]   is that the people doing this stuff,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.520]   the people who write the letters of denunciation
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.020]   are apparently unaware
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.780]   that they're behaving exactly like people
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.220]   in Stalin's Soviet Union.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.620]   They don't know that.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.700]   So they clearly have,
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.020]   there's been a massive educational failure.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.700]   If somebody can write an anonymous
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.220]   or non-anonymous letter of denunciation and not feel shame,
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.620]   I mean, you should feel morally completely contaminated
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.580]   as you're doing that,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.540]   but people haven't been taught
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.740]   the realities of totalitarianism.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.620]   For all these reasons, I think you need to try
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.820]   at least to create a new institution
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:59.820]   where those pathologies will be structurally excluded.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.080]   - So maybe a difficult question.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.040]   Maybe you'll push back on this,
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.140]   but you're widely seen politically as a conservative.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.420]   Hoover Institution is politically conservative.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.900]   What is the role of politics at the University of Austin?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.740]   Because some of the ideas, people listening to this,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.300]   when they hear the ideas you're expressing,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.940]   they may think there's a lean to these ideas.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.180]   There's a conservative lean to these ideas.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.320]   Is there such a lean?
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.140]   - There will certainly be people who say that
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.900]   because the standard mode
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.580]   of trying to discredit any new initiative is to say,
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.260]   oh, this is a sinister conservative plot.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.600]   But one of our co-founders, Heather Hying,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.160]   is definitely not a conservative.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.260]   She's as committed to the idea of academic freedom as I am.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.700]   But I think on political issues,
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.320]   we probably agree on almost nothing.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.940]   And at least I would guess.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.740]   But politics, Max Weber made this point a long time ago,
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.300]   that politics really should stop at the threshold
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.700]   of the classroom, of the lecture hall.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.900]   And in my career, I've always tried to make sure
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.680]   that when I'm teaching,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.960]   it's not clear where I stand politically,
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.300]   though of course undergraduates
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.100]   and insatiably curiously want to know,
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.620]   but it shouldn't be clear from what I say
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.020]   because indoctrination on a political basis
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.860]   is an abuse of the power of the professor,
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.940]   as Weber rightly said.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.940]   So I think one of the key principles
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.820]   of the University of Austin
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.860]   will be that Weberian principle,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.860]   that politics is not an appropriate subject
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.340]   for the lecture hall, for the classroom.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.540]   And we should pursue truth
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.480]   and enshrine liberty of thought.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.740]   If that's a political issue, then I can't help you.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.100]   I mean, if you're against freedom of thought,
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.900]   then we don't really have much of a discussion to have.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.060]   And clearly there are some people
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.300]   who politically seem quite hostile to it.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.020]   But my sense is that there are plenty of people
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.460]   on the left in academia.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.480]   Think of that interesting partnership
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.260]   between Cornel West and Robbie George,
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.460]   which has been institutionalized
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.340]   in the Academic Freedom Alliance.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.980]   It's bipartisan, this issue.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.340]   It really, really is.
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.340]   After all, 50 years ago,
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.420]   it was the left that was in favor of free speech.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.900]   The right still has an anti-free speech element to it.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.100]   Look how quickly they're out to ban critical race theory.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.500]   Critical race theory won't be banned
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.940]   at the University of Texas.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.900]   Wokeism won't be banned.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.020]   Everything will be up for discussion,
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.060]   but the rules of engagement will be clear.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.380]   Chicago principles, those will be enforced.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.540]   And if you have to give a lecture on,
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.420]   well, let's just take a recent example,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.820]   the Dorian Abbott case.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.060]   If you're giving a lecture on astrophysics,
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.780]   but it turns out that in some different venue
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.180]   you express skepticism about affirmative action,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.300]   well, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.180]   It's irrelevant.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.060]   We want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.020]   'cause that's what you're supposed to be giving a lecture on.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.620]   That used to be understood.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.220]   I mean, at the Oxford of the 1980s,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.780]   there were communists and there were ultra-Tories.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.700]   At Cambridge, there were people who were so reactionary
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.100]   that they celebrated Franco's birthday,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.100]   but they were also out-and-out communists
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.620]   down the road at King's College.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.060]   The understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.740]   was part and parcel of university life.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.900]   And frankly, for an undergraduate,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   it was great fun to cross the road
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.220]   and go from outright conservatism,
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.580]   ultra-Toriesm to communism.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.860]   One learns a lot that way.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.220]   But the issue is when you're promoting
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.740]   or hiring or tenuring people,
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.340]   their politics is not relevant.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.900]   It really isn't.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.380]   And when it started to become relevant,
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.180]   and I remember this coming up
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.700]   at the Harvard History Department late in my time there,
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.980]   I felt deeply, deeply uneasy
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.460]   that we were having conversations
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.380]   that amounted to,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.660]   "Well, we can't hire X person
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.860]   despite their obvious academic qualifications
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.020]   because of some political issue."
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.420]   That's not what should happen at a healthy university.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.780]   - Some practical questions.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:36.060]   Will University of Austin be a physical in-person university
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.940]   or a virtual university?
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.540]   What are some, in that aspect,
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.300]   where the classroom is?
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.700]   - It will be a real space institution.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.620]   There may be an online dimension to it
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.260]   because there clearly are a lot of things
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.300]   that you can do via the internet.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.140]   But the core activity of teaching and learning,
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.980]   I think, requires real space.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.860]   And I've thought about this a long time, debated.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.300]   Sebastian Thrun about this many, many years ago
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.460]   when he was a complete believer in,
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.940]   let's call it the metaversity, to go with the metaverse.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.980]   I mean, the metaversity was going to happen, wasn't it?
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.860]   But I never really believed in the metaversity.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.300]   I didn't do MOOCs because I just didn't think
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.220]   you'd A, be able to retain the attention,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.860]   B, be able to cope with the scaled grading
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.940]   that was involved.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.900]   I think there's a reason universities have been around
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.180]   in their form for about a millennium.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.460]   You kind of need to all be in the same place.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.820]   So I think answer to that question,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.900]   definitely a campus in the Austin area,
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.700]   that's where we'll start.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.060]   And if we can allow some of our content
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.500]   to be available online, great, we'll certainly do that.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.900]   - Another question is,
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.460]   what kind of courses and programming will it offer?
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.020]   Is that something you can speak to?
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.660]   What's your vision here?
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.420]   - We think that we need to begin more like a startup
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.020]   than like a full-service university from day one.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.140]   So our vision is that we start with a summer school,
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.380]   which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:17.380]   We want, I think, to begin by giving a platform
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.820]   to the professors who've been most subject
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.900]   to cancel culture, and also to give an opportunity
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.700]   to students who want to hear them to come.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.100]   So we'll start with a summer school
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.980]   that will be somewhat in the tradition
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.300]   of those institutions in the interwar period
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.780]   that were havens for refugees.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.340]   So we're dealing here with the internal refugees
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.740]   of the woke era.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.380]   We'll start there.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.460]   It'll be an opportunity to test out some content,
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.460]   see what students will come and spend time in Austin to hear.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.620]   So that's part A, that's the sort of,
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.100]   if you like the launch product.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.260]   And then we go straight to a master's program.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.340]   I don't think you can go to undergraduate education
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.620]   right away because the established brands
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.220]   in undergraduate education are offering something
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.980]   it's impossible to compete with initially
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.820]   because they have the brand, Harvard, Yale, Stanford,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   and they offer also this peer network,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.660]   which is part of the reason people want so badly
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.060]   to go to those places, not really the professors,
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.500]   it's the classmates.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.100]   So we don't want to compete there initially.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.180]   Where there is, I think, room for new entrants
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.940]   is in a master's program.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.820]   And the first one will be in entrepreneurship
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.340]   and leadership, because I think there's a huge hunger
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.100]   amongst people who want to get into,
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.980]   particularly the technology world,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.060]   to learn about those things.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.820]   And they know they're not really going to learn
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.700]   about them at business schools.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.100]   The people who are not going to teach them leadership
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.500]   and entrepreneurship are professors.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.420]   So we want to create something that will be a little like
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.620]   the very successful Schwarzman program in China,
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.100]   which was come and spend a year in China
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.500]   and find out about China.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.460]   We'll be doing the same, essentially saying,
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.220]   come and spend a year and find out about technology.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.100]   And there'll be a mix of academic content.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.900]   We want people to understand some of the first principles
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.420]   of what they're studying.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.580]   There are first principles of entrepreneurship
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.500]   and leadership, but we also want them to spend time
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.340]   with people like one of our co-founders, Joe Lonsdale,
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.980]   who's been a hugely successful venture capitalist
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.140]   and learn directly from people like him.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.740]   So that's the kind of initial offering.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.660]   I think there are other master's programs
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.820]   that we will look to roll out quite quickly.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.500]   I have a particular passion for a master's in applied history
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.460]   or politics and applied history.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.660]   I'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.580]   of academic historians to drift away from
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.660]   what seemed to me the important questions
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.380]   and certainly to drift away from addressing
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.820]   policy relevant questions.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.060]   So I would love to be involved in a master's
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.740]   in applied history.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.980]   And we'll build some programs like that
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.980]   before we get to the full liberal arts experience
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.980]   that we envisage for an undergraduate program.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.060]   And that undergraduate program is an exciting one
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.660]   'cause I think we can be innovative there too.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.220]   I would say two years would be spent
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.620]   doing some very classical and difficult classical things,
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.940]   bridging those old divides between arts and sciences.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.900]   But then there would also be in the second half
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.500]   in the junior and senior years,
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.060]   something somewhat more of an apprenticeship
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.500]   where we'll have centers,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   including a center for technology,
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.660]   engineering, and mathematics,
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.740]   that will be designed to help people make that transition
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.780]   from the theoretical to the practical.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.980]   So that's the vision.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.980]   And I think like any early stage idea
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.220]   we'll doubtless tweak it as we go along.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.340]   We'll find things that work and things that don't work.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.340]   But I have a very clear sense in my own mind
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.980]   of how this should look five years from now.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.820]   And I don't know about you.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.780]   I mean, I'm unusual as an academic
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.780]   'cause I quite like starting new institutions
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.260]   and I've done a bit of it in my career.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.140]   You got to kind of know what it should look like
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.140]   after the first four or five years
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.660]   to get out of bed in the morning
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.900]   and put up with all the kind of hassles of doing it,
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.180]   not least the inevitable flack
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.080]   that we're bound to take from the educational establishment.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.920]   - And I was graciously invited to be an advisor
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.300]   to this University of Austin.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.540]   And the reason I would love to help
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.840]   in whatever way I can is several.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.480]   So one, I would love to see Austin,
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.980]   the physical location flourish intellectually
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.420]   and especially in the space of science and engineering.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.420]   That's really exciting to me.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.860]   Another reason is I am still a research scientist at MIT.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.580]   I still love MIT.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.780]   And I see this effort that you're launching
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.220]   as a beacon that leads the way
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.420]   to the other elite institutions in the world.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.500]   I think too many of my colleagues,
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.140]   and especially in robotics,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:35.900]   don't see robotics as a humanities problem.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.940]   But to me,
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.820]   robotics and AI will define much of our world
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.260]   in the next century.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.660]   And not to consider all the deep psychological,
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.760]   sociological, human problems associated with that.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.860]   To have real open conversations, to say stupid things,
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   to challenge the ideas of how companies are being run,
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.140]   for example, that is the safe space.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.540]   It's very difficult to talk about the difficult questions
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.380]   about technology when you're employed by Facebook
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.140]   or Google and so on.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.420]   The university is the place to have those conversations.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.260]   - That's right.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.020]   And we're hugely excited that you want
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.300]   to be one of our advisors.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.300]   We need a broad and eclectic group of people.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.460]   And I'm excited by the way that group has developed.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.540]   Some of my favorite intellectuals are there.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.300]   Steve Pinker, for example.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.860]   But we're also making sure that we have people
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.860]   with experience in academic leadership.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:54.020]   And so it's a happy coalition of the willing
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.640]   looking to try to build something new,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.860]   which as you say, will be complimentary
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.300]   to the existing and established institutions.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.260]   I think of the academic world as a network.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.260]   I've moved from some major hubs in the network to others,
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.900]   but I've always felt that we do our best work,
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.380]   not in a silo called Oxford,
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.020]   but in a silo that is really a hub connected to Stanford,
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.540]   connected to Harvard, connected to MIT.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.340]   One of the reasons I moved to the United States
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.340]   was that I sensed that there was more intellectual action
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.780]   in my original field of expertise, financial history.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.300]   And that was right.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.020]   It was a good move.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.020]   I think I'd have stagnated if I'd stayed at Oxford.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.540]   But at the same time,
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.420]   I haven't lost connection with Oxford.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.780]   I recently went and gave a lecture there
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.500]   in honor of Sir Roger Scruton,
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.820]   one of the great conservative philosophers.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.220]   And the burden of my lecture was
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.060]   the idea of the Anglosphere,
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.980]   which appealed a lot to Roger,
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.500]   will go horribly wrong if illiberal ideas
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.900]   that inhibit academic freedom
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.780]   spread all over the Anglosphere.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.460]   And this network gets infected with these,
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.980]   I think, deeply damaging notions.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.540]   So yeah, I think we're creating a new node.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.540]   I hope it's a node that makes the network
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.340]   overall more resilient.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.820]   And right now there's an urgent need for it.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.300]   I mean, there are people
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   whose academic careers have been terminated.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.660]   I'll name two who were involved.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   Peter Boghossian, who was harassed out of Portland State
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.700]   for the reason that he was one of those intrepid figures
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:47.060]   who carried out the grievance studies hoaxes,
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.540]   exposing the utter charlatanry going on
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.020]   in many supposedly academic journals
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.940]   by getting phony gender studies articles published.
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.820]   It was genius.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.900]   And of course, so put the noses out of joint
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.300]   of the academic establishment
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.260]   that he began to be subject to disciplinary actions.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.300]   So Peter is going to be involved.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   And in a recent shocking British case,
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.660]   the philosopher Kathleen Stock
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.540]   has essentially been run off the campus
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.500]   of Sussex University in England
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:21.340]   for violating the increasingly complex rules
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.180]   about discussing transgender issues and women's rights.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.260]   She will be one of our advisors.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.740]   And I think also one of our founding fellows
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.020]   actually teaching for us in our first iteration.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.820]   So I think we're creating a node that's badly needed.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.820]   Those people, I mean, I remember saying this
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.220]   to the other founders
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.580]   when we first began to talk about this idea,
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.300]   to Barry Weiss and to Pano Canellos
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.660]   as well as to Heather Hying.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.020]   We need to do this urgently
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.900]   because there are people whose livelihoods
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.820]   are in fact being destroyed
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.620]   by these extraordinarily illiberal campaigns against them.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.060]   And so there's no time to hang around
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.340]   and come up with the perfect design.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.140]   This is an urgently needed lifeboat.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.580]   And let's start with that.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.620]   And then we can build something spectacular
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.700]   taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.260]   well, they now have very real skin in the game.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.780]   They need to make this a success
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.540]   and I'm sure they will help us make it a success.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.660]   - So you mentioned some interesting names
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.420]   like Heather Hying, Barry Weiss and so on.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.180]   Steven Pinker, somebody I really admire.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.240]   He too was under quite a lot of fire.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.860]   Many reasons I admire him,
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.580]   one, because of his optimism about the future
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.540]   and two, how little of a damn he seems to give
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.020]   about the like walking through the fire.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.340]   There's nobody more Zen about walking through the fire
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.340]   than Steven Pinker.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.220]   But anyway, you mentioned a lot of interesting names.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.980]   Jonathan Haidt is also interesting there.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.940]   Who is involved with this venture at this early days?
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.780]   - Well, one of the things that I'm excited about
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:08.220]   is that we're getting people from inside and outside
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   the academic world.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.860]   So we've got Arthur Brooks, who for many years
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.660]   ran the American Enterprise Institute very successfully,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.980]   has a Harvard role now teaching.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.700]   And so he's somebody who brings, I think,
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.200]   a different perspective.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.700]   There's obviously a need to get experienced
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.060]   academic leaders involved,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.620]   which is why I was talking to Larry Summers
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.520]   about whether he would join our board of advisors.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.900]   The Chicago principals owe a debt
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.220]   to the former president of Chicago
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.140]   and he's graciously agreed to be in the board of advisors.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.260]   I could go on, it would become a long and tedious list,
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.260]   but my goal in trying to get this happy band to form
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.020]   has been to signal that it's a bipartisan endeavor.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.420]   It is not a conservative institution
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.340]   that we're trying to build.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.260]   It's an institution that's committed to academic freedom
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.740]   and the pursuit of truth that will mean it
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.420]   when it takes Robert Zimmer's Chicago principals
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.900]   and enshrines them in its founding charter.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.540]   And we'll make those something other than honored
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.660]   in the breach, which they seem to be at some institutions.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.340]   So the idea here is to grow this organically.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.620]   We need, rather like the Academic Freedom Alliance
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.080]   that Robbie George created earlier this year,
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.380]   we need breadth and we need to show
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.500]   that this is not some kind of institutionalization
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.620]   of the intellectual dark web,
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.420]   though we welcome founding members of that nebulous body.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.460]   It's really something designed for all of academia
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.300]   to provide a kind of reboot
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.260]   that I think we all agree is needed.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.860]   - Is there a George Washington type figure?
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.580]   Is there a president elected yet?
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.260]   Or who's going to lead this institution?
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.180]   - Pano Canellos, the former president of St. John's,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.420]   is the president of University of Austin.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.380]   And so he is our George Washington.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.980]   I don't know who Alexander Hamilton is.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.580]   I'll leave you to guess.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.820]   - It's funny you mentioned IDW, intellectual dark web.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.900]   Have you talked to your friend Sam Harris
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.980]   about any of this?
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.740]   He is another person I really admire
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.500]   and I've talked to online and offline quite a bit
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.180]   for not belonging to any tribe.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.020]   He stands boldly on his convictions
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.620]   when he knows they're not going to be popular.
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:50.620]   He basically gets canceled by every group.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.260]   He doesn't shy away from controversy
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.980]   and not for the sake of controversy itself,
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.220]   he is one of the best examples to me
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.620]   of a person who thinks freely.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.020]   I disagree with him on quite a few things,
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.820]   but I deeply admire that he is what it looks like
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.780]   to think freely by himself.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.300]   It feels to me like he represents a lot of the ideals
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.540]   of this kind of effort.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.500]   - Yes, he would be a natural fit.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.380]   Sam, if you're listening, I hope you're in.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.660]   I think in the course of his recent intellectual quests,
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.100]   he did collide with one of our founders, Heather Hying.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.020]   So we'll have to model civil disagreements
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.620]   at the University of Austin.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.540]   It's extremely important that we should all disagree
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.780]   about many things, but do it amicably.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.180]   One of the things that has been lost sight of,
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.860]   perhaps it's all the fault of Twitter
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.340]   or maybe it's something more profound,
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.660]   is that it is possible to disagree in a civil way.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.660]   And still be friends.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.020]   I certainly had friends at Oxford
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.460]   who were far to the left of me politically,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.500]   and they are still among my best friends.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.620]   So the University of Austin has to be a place
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.340]   where we can disagree vehemently,
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.540]   but we can then go and have a beer afterwards.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.740]   That's, in my mind, a really important part
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.780]   of university life, learning the difference
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.660]   between the political and the personal.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.060]   So Sam is, I think, a good example, as are you,
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:24.060]   of a certain kind of intellectual hero
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.140]   who has been willing to go into the cyber sphere,
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:35.580]   the metaverse, and carve out an intellectual space,
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:42.460]   the podcast, and debate everything fearlessly.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:47.940]   His essay, it was really an essay on Black Lives Matter
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.820]   and the question of police racism,
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.620]   was a masterpiece of 2020.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:38:00.700]   And so he, I think, is a model of what we believe in.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.700]   But we can't save the world with podcasts,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.860]   good though yours is,
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   because there's a kind of solo element
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.100]   to this form of public intellectual activity.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.740]   It's also there in Substack,
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.860]   where all our best writers now seem to be,
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.580]   including our founder, Barry Weiss.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.860]   The danger with this approach is, ultimately,
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.380]   your subscribers are the people who already agree with you,
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.040]   and we are all, therefore,
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.780]   in danger of preaching to the choir.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.100]   I think what makes an institution
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.940]   like University of Austin so attractive
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.700]   is that we get everybody together
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.460]   at least part of the year,
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.460]   and we do that informal interaction at lunch, at dinner,
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:56.620]   that allows, in my experience, the best ideas to form.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.460]   Intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.420]   Historians often make it seem that way,
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.020]   but I've realized over time that I do my best work
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.140]   in a collaborative way,
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.620]   and scientists have been better at this
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.420]   than people in the humanities.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.780]   But what really matters,
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.100]   what's magical about a good university
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.500]   is that interdisciplinary, serendipitous conversation
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.460]   that happens on campus.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.500]   Tom Sargent, the great Nobel Prize-winning economist,
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.820]   and I used to have these kind of random conversations
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.540]   in elevators at NYU or in corridors at Stanford,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.680]   and sometimes they'd be quite short conversations,
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.040]   but in that short, serendipitous exchange,
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.540]   I would have more intellectual stimulus
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.420]   than in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.300]   So I think we want to get the Sam Harrises
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.460]   and Lex Freedmans out of their darkened rooms
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.020]   and give them a chance to interact
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:59.020]   in a much less structured way than we've got used to.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.740]   Again, it's that sense that sometimes
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.620]   you need some freewheeling, unstructured debate
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.300]   to get the really good ideas.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.940]   I mean, to talk anecdotally for a moment,
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.020]   I look back on my Oxford undergraduate experience,
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.700]   and I wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes,
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.220]   but intellectually, the most important thing I did
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.420]   was to write an essay on the Viennese satirist Karl Kraus
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.940]   for an undergraduate discussion group
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.460]   called the Canon Club.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.020]   And I probably put more work into that paper
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.500]   than I put into anything else
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.820]   except maybe my final examinations,
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.100]   even although there was only really one senior member present
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.820]   the historian Jeremy Cattell,
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.900]   I was really just trying to impress my contemporaries.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.760]   And that's the kind of thing we want.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.900]   The great intellectuals,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.120]   the great intellectual leaps forward occurred
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.200]   often in somewhat unstructured settings.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.100]   I'm from Scotland,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.320]   you can tell from my accent a little at least.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.080]   The enlightenment happened in late 18th century Scotland
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.300]   in a very interesting interplay between the universities,
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.900]   which were very important, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St. Andrews,
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.900]   and the coffee houses and pubs of the Scottish cities
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.780]   where a lot of unstructured discussion
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.120]   often fueled by copious amounts of wine took place.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.320]   That's what I've missed over the last few years.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.360]   Let's just think about how hard
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.520]   academic social life has become.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.080]   That we've reached the point
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.360]   that Amy Chua becomes the object
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.640]   of a full-blown investigation and media storm
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.240]   for inviting two Yale Law School students
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.000]   over to her house to talk.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.880]   I mean, when I was at Oxford,
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.200]   it was regarded as a tremendous honor
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.120]   to be asked to go to one of our tutors' homes.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.720]   The social life of Oxford and Cambridge
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.160]   is one of their great strengths.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.640]   There's a sort of requirement
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.600]   to sip unpleasant sherry with the Dons.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.400]   And we've kind of killed all that.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.600]   We've killed all that in the US
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.160]   'cause nobody dares have a social interaction
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.340]   with an undergraduate or exchange an informal email
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.720]   in case the whole thing ends up
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.560]   on the front page of the local or student newspaper.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.080]   So that's what we need to kind of restore,
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.600]   the social life of academia.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.440]   - So there's magic.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.380]   We didn't really address this sort of explicitly,
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.520]   but there's magic to the interaction between students.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.440]   There's magic in the interaction between faculty,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.400]   the people that teach,
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.920]   and there's the magic in the interaction
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.640]   between the students and the faculty.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.840]   And it's an iterative process
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.080]   that changes everybody involved.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.960]   So it's like world experts in a particular discipline
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.880]   are changed as much as the students,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.920]   as the 20-year-olds with the wild ideas,
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.160]   each are changed.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160]   And that's the magic of it.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.200]   That applies in liberal education.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.560]   That applies in the sciences too.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.600]   That's probably, maybe you can speak to this,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.800]   why so much scientific innovation
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.680]   has happened in the universities.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.640]   There's something about the youthful energy
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.520]   of like young minds, graduate students,
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.540]   undergraduate students that inspire
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.740]   some of the world experts to do some of the best work
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.580]   of their lives.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.420]   - Yeah.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.160]   Well, the human brain we know is at its most dynamic
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.320]   when people are pretty young.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.640]   You know this with your background in math.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.000]   People don't get better at math after the age of 30.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.840]   And this is important when you think about
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   the intergenerational character of a university.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.220]   The older people, the professors have the experience,
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.840]   but they're fading intellectually
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.260]   from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:55.260]   And so you get this intellectual shot in the arm
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.360]   from hanging out with people who are circa 20,
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.440]   don't know shit, but the brains are kind of like cooking.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.280]   - Yeah.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.400]   - I look back on the career I've had in teaching,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.920]   which is over 25 years where Cambridge, Oxford, NYU, Harvard.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.480]   And I have extremely strong relationships
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.360]   with students from those institutions
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:23.200]   because they would show up,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.160]   whether it was at office hours or in tutorials
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   and disagree with me.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.800]   And for me, it's always been about encouraging
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.120]   some active intellectual rebellion,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:38.720]   telling people, "I don't want your essay to echo my views.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.760]   If you can find something wrong with what I wrote, great.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.360]   Or if you can find something I missed that's new, fantastic."
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.040]   So there is definitely, as you said,
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.840]   a magic in that interaction across the generations.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.280]   And it's extraordinarily difficult, I think,
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.240]   for an intellectual to make the same progress
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.120]   in a project in isolation
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.280]   compared with the progress that can be made
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.840]   in these very special communities.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.320]   What does a university do amongst other things?
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.120]   It creates a somewhat artificial environment
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.280]   of abnormal job security,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.560]   and that's the whole idea of giving people tenure,
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.640]   and then a relatively high turnover, new faces each year,
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.080]   and an institutionalization of thought experiments
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.040]   and actual experiments.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.360]   And then you get everybody living
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.600]   in the same kind of vicinity
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.720]   so that it can spill over into 3 a.m. conversation.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.520]   Well, that always seems to me
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.200]   to be a pretty potent combination.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.720]   Let's ask ourselves a counterfactual question next.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   Let's imagine that the world wars happen,
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.760]   but there are no universities.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.880]   I mean, how does the Manhattan Project happen
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.200]   with no academia, to take just one of many examples?
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   In truth, how does Britain even stay in the war
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.400]   without Bletchley Park,
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   without being able to crack the German cipher?
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.680]   The academics are unsung,
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.360]   partly sung heroes of these conflicts.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.960]   The same is true in the Soviet Union.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.600]   The Soviet Union was a terribly evil and repressive system,
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.280]   but it was good at science,
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.840]   and that kept it in the game,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.840]   not only in World War II, it kept it in the Cold War.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.640]   So it's clear that universities
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.520]   are incredibly powerful intellectual force multipliers,
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:41.120]   and our history without them would look very different.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.280]   Sure, some innovations would have happened without them.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.120]   That's clear.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.000]   The Industrial Revolution didn't need universities.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.320]   In fact, they played a very marginal role
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.840]   in the key technological breakthroughs
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.000]   of the Industrial Revolution in its first phase.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.960]   But by the second Industrial Revolution
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.600]   in the late 19th century,
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.840]   German industry would not have leapt ahead
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.600]   of British industry if the universities
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.400]   had not been superior.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.240]   And it was the fact
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.120]   that the Germans institutionalized scientific research
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.840]   in the way that they did,
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.160]   that really produced a powerful, powerful advantage.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.000]   The problem was that,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.760]   and this is a really interesting point,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.440]   that Friedrich Meinicke makes
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.640]   in "Die deutsche Katastrophe,"
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.520]   for the German catastrophe,
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.800]   the German intellectuals became technocrats,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.560]   homo faber, he says.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.720]   They knew a great deal about their speciality,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.440]   but they were alienated from, broadly speaking, humanism.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.680]   And that is his explanation,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.760]   or one of his explanations,
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.280]   for why this very scientifically advanced Germany
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.080]   goes down the path of hell led by Hitler.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.880]   So when I come back and ask myself,
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.840]   what is it that we want to do with a new university?
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.800]   We wanna make sure that we don't fall into that German pit
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.960]   where very high levels of technical
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.840]   and scientific expertise are decoupled
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   from the fundamental foundations of a free society.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   So liberal arts are there, I think,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.760]   to stop the scientists making Faustian pacts.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.440]   And that's why it's really important
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.520]   that people working on AI read Shakespeare.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.600]   - I think you said that academics are unsung heroes
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.720]   of the 20th century.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.200]   I think there's kind of an intellectual,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   a lazy intellectual desire to kind of destroy the academics,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.720]   that the academics are the source
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.840]   of all problems in the world.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.520]   And I personally believe that exactly as you said,
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.400]   we need to recognize that the university
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:45.080]   is probably where the ideas that will protect us
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   from the catastrophes that are looming ahead of us,
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.800]   that's where those ideas are going to come from.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.080]   - People who work on economics
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.280]   can argue back and forth about John Maynard Keynes.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.720]   But I think it's pretty clear
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.200]   that he was the most important economist
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.520]   and certainly the most influential economist
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.600]   of the 20th century.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.320]   And I think his ideas are looking better today
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.960]   in the wake of the financial crisis
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.840]   than they have at any time since the 1970s.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.920]   But imagine John Maynard Keynes without Cambridge,
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.800]   you can't, because someone like that
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   doesn't actually exist without the incredible hothouse
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.880]   that a place like Cambridge was in Keynes' life.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.720]   He was a product
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.440]   of a kind of hereditary intellectual elite
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.920]   that had its vices,
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.840]   but you can't help but admire the sheer power of the mind.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.200]   I've spent a lot of my career reading Keynes
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.680]   and I revere that intellect.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.480]   It's so, so powerful,
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.600]   but you can't have people like that
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.720]   if you're not prepared to have King's College Cambridge.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.040]   And it comes with redundancy.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:57.880]   I think that's the point.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.480]   There are lots and lots of things
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.320]   that are very annoying about academic life
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.280]   that you just have to deal with.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.040]   They're made fun of in that recent Netflix series,
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.160]   "The Chair,"
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.360]   and it is easy to make fun of academic life.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.760]   Tom Sharpe's "Porterhouse Blue" did it.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.880]   It's an inherently comical subject.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.320]   Professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.080]   but we've sort of killed off that side of academia
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:32.080]   by turning it into an increasingly doctrinaire place
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.880]   where eccentricity is not tolerated.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.200]   I'll give you an illustration of this.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.400]   I had a call this morning from a British academic
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.640]   who said, "Can you give me some advice?"
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.760]   Because they're trying to decolonize the curriculum.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.400]   This is coming from the diversity,
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.680]   equity, and inclusion officers.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.000]   And it seems to me that what they're requiring of us
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.560]   is a fundamental violation of academic freedom
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.760]   because it is determining ex ante
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.600]   what we should study and teach.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.080]   That's what's going on.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:11.520]   And that's the thing that we really, really have to resist
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.000]   because that kills the university.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.320]   That's the moment that it stops being the magical place
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.240]   of intellectual creativity
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.040]   and simply becomes an adjunct
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.000]   of the ministry of propaganda.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.240]   - I've loved the time we've spent talking about this
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.920]   because it's such a hopeful message
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.240]   for the future of the university
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.400]   that I still share with you
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.840]   the love of the ideal of the university.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.400]   So very practical question.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.320]   You mentioned summer.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.600]   Which summer are we talking about?
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.360]   So when, I know we don't wanna put hard dates here,
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.120]   but what year are we thinking about?
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.560]   When is this thing launching?
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.760]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.560]   - We are moving as fast as our resources allow.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.760]   The goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.800]   next summer, summer of 2022.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.680]   And we hope to be able to launch an initial,
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:12.240]   albeit relatively small scale master's program
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.440]   in the fall of next year.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.160]   That's as fast as is humanly possible.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.960]   So yeah, we're really keen to get going.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.880]   And I think the approach we're taking
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.040]   is somewhat imported from Silicon Valley.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   Think of this as a startup.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   Don't think of this as something that has to exist
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.760]   as a full service university on day one.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.120]   We don't have the resources for that.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.680]   You'd need billions and billions of dollars
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.960]   to build a university sort of as a facsimile
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.040]   of an existing university,
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.200]   but that's not what we want to do.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.560]   I mean, copying and pasting Harvard or Yale or Stanford
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.760]   would be a futile thing to do.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.120]   They would probably, you very quickly end up
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.360]   with the same pathologies.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.160]   So we do have to come up with a different design.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.600]   And one way of doing that is to grow it organically
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.920]   from something quite small.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   Elon Musk mentioned in his usual humorous way on Twitter
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.560]   that he wants to launch
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   the Texas Institute of Technology and Science, TITS.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.320]   Some people thought this was sexist
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.880]   because of the acronym TITS.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.520]   So first of all, I understand their viewpoint,
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.160]   but I also think there needs to be a place for humor
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.480]   on the internet, even from CEO.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.760]   So on this podcast, I've gotten a chance
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.400]   to talk to quite a few CEOs.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.520]   And what I love to see is authenticity.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.160]   And humor is often a sign of authenticity.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.840]   The quirkiness that you mentioned
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.600]   is such a beautiful characteristic of professors
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.520]   and faculty in great universities
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.280]   is also beautiful to see as CEOs, especially founding CEOs.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.280]   So anyway, the deeper point he was making
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.360]   is showing an excitement for the university
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.080]   as a place for big ideas
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.600]   in science, technology, engineering.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.960]   So to me, if there's some kind of way,
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.520]   if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet,
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.920]   not to analyze Elon Musk's Twitter like it's Shakespeare,
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.820]   but if there's a serious thought,
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:18.320]   I would love to see him supporting the flourishing of Austin
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.360]   as a place for science, technology,
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.280]   for these kinds of intellectual developments
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.920]   that we're talking about,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   like make a place for free inquiry, civil disagreements,
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.880]   coupled with great education and conversations
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.120]   about artificial intelligence,
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.280]   about technology, about engineering.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.800]   So I'm actually gonna,
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.840]   I hope there's a serious idea behind that tweet
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.320]   and I'm gonna chat with him about it.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.520]   - I do too, I do too.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   Most of the biggest storms and teacups
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:59.180]   of my academic career have been caused by bad jokes
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:00.020]   that I've made.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.960]   These days, if you wanna make bad jokes,
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.900]   being a billionaire is a great idea.
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:12.400]   I'm not here to defend Elon's Twitter style
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.280]   or sense of humor.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.320]   He's not gonna be remembered for his tweets, I think.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:21.440]   He's gonna be remembered for the astonishing companies
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.520]   that he's built and his contributions
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:29.400]   in a whole range of fields from SpaceX to Tesla
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.020]   and solar energy.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.760]   And I very much hope that we can interest Elon
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.580]   in this project.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:40.840]   We need not only Elon, but a whole range of his peers
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:45.440]   because this takes resources.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.680]   Universities are not cheap things to run,
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.400]   especially if, as I hope, we can make as much
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   of the tuition covered by scholarships and bursaries.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:02.600]   We want to attract the best intellectual talent
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.940]   to this institution.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.260]   The best intellectual talent is somewhat randomly
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.720]   distributed through society.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.340]   And some of it is in the bottom quintile
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.040]   of the income distribution.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.160]   And that makes it hard to get to elite education.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.440]   So this will take resources.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   The last generation of super wealthy plutocrats,
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.240]   the generation of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century,
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.960]   did a pretty good job of founding universities.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.400]   Now, Chicago wouldn't exist, but for the money of that era.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.760]   And so my message to not only to Elon,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.820]   but to all of the peers, all of those people
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.520]   who made their billions out of technology
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.720]   over the last couple of decades is this is your time.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.120]   I mean, and this is your opportunity
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.480]   to create something new.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   I can't really understand why the wealthy of our time
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.080]   are content to hand their money.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.920]   I mean, think of the vast sums Mike Bloomberg
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.880]   recently gave to Johns Hopkins,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.160]   to his established institutions.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:06.040]   When on close inspection, those institutions
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.560]   don't seem to spend the money terribly well.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.240]   And in fact, one of the mysteries of our time
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.800]   is the lack of due diligence that hard-nosed billionaires
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.600]   seem to do when it comes to philanthropy.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.080]   So I think there's an opportunity here
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.520]   for this generation of very talented, wealthy people
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.360]   to do what their counterparts did in the late 19th
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.960]   and early 20th century and create some new institutions.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.200]   And they don't need to put their names on the buildings.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.760]   They just need to do what the founders
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.800]   of University of Chicago did,
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.640]   create something new that will endure.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:49.480]   - Yeah, MIT is launching a college of computing
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:54.480]   and Seymour Schwarzman has given quite a large sum of money,
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.160]   I think in total a billion dollars.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.640]   And as somebody who loves computing
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.520]   and somebody who loves MIT, I want some accountability
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:07.360]   for MIT becoming a better institution.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.760]   And this is once again, why I'm excited
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.560]   about University of Austin, 'cause it serves as a beacon.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.720]   Look, you can create something new
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.760]   and this is what the great institutions
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.600]   of the future should look like.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.720]   - And Steve Schwarzman is also an innovator.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.160]   The idea of creating a college on the Tsinghua campus
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.680]   and creating a kind of Rhodes program for students
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.520]   from the Western world to come study in China
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.680]   was Steve's idea.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.760]   And I was somewhat involved,
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.860]   did some visiting, professing there.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.760]   It taught me that you can create something new
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.360]   in that area of graduate education
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:50.080]   and quite quickly attract really strong applicants.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.640]   Because the people who finished their four years
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   at Harvard or Stanford know that they don't know a lot.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   And I, having taught a lot of people in that group,
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.520]   know how intellectually dissatisfied they often are
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.280]   at the end of four years.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.540]   I mean, they may have beautifully gamed the system
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.780]   to graduate summa magna cum laude,
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.580]   but they kind of know,
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:17.060]   they'll confess it after a drink or two.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.600]   They know that they gamed the system
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.700]   and that intellectually it wasn't
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.620]   the fulfilling experience they wanted.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.740]   And they also know that an MBA
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.580]   from a comparable institution
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.620]   would not be a massive intellectual step forward.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.060]   So I think what we want to say
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:35.500]   is here's something really novel, exciting,
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.140]   that will be intellectually very challenging.
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:41.220]   I do think the University of Austin has to be difficult.
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:44.280]   I'd like it to feel a little bit like
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.240]   surviving Navy SEAL training to come through this program
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.640]   because it will be intellectually demanding.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.560]   And that I think should be a magnet.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.520]   So yeah, Steve, if you're listening,
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.100]   please join Elon in supporting this.
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.000]   And Peter Thiel, if you're listening,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.520]   I know how skeptical you are
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.560]   about the idea of creating a new university
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.940]   'cause heaven knows,
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.840]   Peter and I have been discussing this idea for years
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.680]   and he's always said, "Well, no, we thought about this
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   "and it just isn't gonna work."
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   But I really think we've got a responsibility to do this.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.340]   - Well, Steve's been on this podcast before.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.160]   We've spoken a few times, so I'll send this to him.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.520]   I hope he does actually get behind it as well.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.520]   So I'm super excited by the ideas
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.920]   that we've been talking about that this effort represents
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.140]   and what ripple effect it has on the rest of society.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.980]   So thank you.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.640]   That was a time beautifully spent.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   And I'm really grateful for the fortune
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.920]   of getting a chance to talk to you
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.640]   at this moment in history
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.120]   because I've been a big fan of your work.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.800]   And the reason I wanted to talk to you today
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.280]   is about all the excellent books you've written
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.400]   about various aspects of history through money,
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.920]   war, power, pandemics, all of that.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.720]   But I'm glad that we got a chance to talk about this,
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.320]   which is not looking at history, it's looking at the future.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.760]   This is a beautiful little fortuitous moment.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.600]   I appreciate you talking about it.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.160]   In the book "Ascent of Money,"
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.920]   you give a history of the world through the lens of money.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.040]   If the financial system is evolutionary in nature,
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.560]   much like life on earth,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.120]   what is the origin of money on earth?
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.620]   - The origin of money predates coins.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.800]   Most people kind of assume I'll talk about coins,
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.180]   but coins are relatively late developments.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.000]   Back in ancient Mesopotamia,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.900]   so I don't know, 5,000 years ago,
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:51.720]   there were relations between creditors and debtors.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.080]   There are even in the simplest economy
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.960]   because of the way in which agriculture works.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.920]   Hey, I need to plant these seeds,
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.600]   but I'm not gonna have crops for X months.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.520]   So we have clay tablets
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.560]   in which simple debt transactions are inscribed.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560]   I remember looking at great numbers of these
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.920]   in the British Museum when I was writing "The Ascent of Money,"
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.120]   and that's really the beginning of money.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.920]   The minute you start recording a relationship
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.160]   between a creditor and a debtor,
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.720]   you have something that is quasi money.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.720]   And that is probably what these clay tablets mostly denoted.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:33.560]   From that point on,
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.920]   there's a great evolutionary experiment
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.760]   to see what the most convenient way is
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.760]   to record relations between creditors and debtors.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.960]   And what emerges in the time of the ancient Greeks
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.920]   are coins, metal, tokens,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.480]   sometimes a valuable metal, sometimes not,
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.260]   And that's the sort of more familiar form of money
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.580]   that we still use today for very, very small transactions.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.800]   I expect coins will all be gone
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   by the time my youngest son is my age,
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.240]   but they're a last remnant of a very, very old way
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.440]   of doing simple transactions.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.000]   - By the way, when you say coins, you mean physical coins.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.280]   - I'm talking about- - Because the term coins
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.720]   has been rebranded into digital space as well.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.280]   - Yeah, not coin-based coins, actual coin coins,
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.560]   you know, the ones that jangle in your pocket
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.680]   and you kind of don't know quite what to do with
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.960]   once you have some.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.960]   So that became an incredibly pervasive form
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.400]   of paying for things.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.040]   Money's just a, it's just a crystallization
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.140]   And coins are just very fungible.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.800]   You know, whereas a clay tablet relates
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.360]   to a specific transaction, coins are generic and fungible.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.280]   They can be used in any transaction.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.080]   So that was an important evolutionary advance.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.440]   If you think of financial history,
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.320]   and this was the point of "The Ascent of Money"
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.560]   as an evolutionary story, there are punctuated equilibria.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.480]   People get by with coins for a long time,
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.120]   despite their defects as a means of payment,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.160]   such as that they can be debased, they can be clipped.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.800]   It's very hard to avoid a fake
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.760]   or debased money entering the system.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.800]   But coinage is still kind of the basis of payments
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.200]   all the way through the Roman Empire,
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.960]   out the other end into the so-called dark ages.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.400]   It's still how most things are settled
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.880]   in cash transactions in the early 1300s.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.800]   You don't get a big shift until after the Black Death,
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.920]   when there is such a need to monetize the economy
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.440]   because of chronic labor shortages
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.720]   and feudalism begins to unravel,
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.880]   that you just don't have a sufficient amount of coinage.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.240]   And so you get bills of exchange.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.640]   And I'm really into bills of exchange because,
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.960]   and this I hope will capture your listeners
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.360]   and viewers' imaginations,
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.260]   when they start using bills of exchange,
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.400]   which are really just pieces of paper saying,
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.360]   you know, I owe you over a three-month period
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.920]   while goods are in transit from Florence to London,
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.000]   you get the first peer-to-peer payment system,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.640]   which is network verified.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.320]   'Cause they're not coins,
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.480]   they don't have a king's head on them.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.320]   They're just pieces of paper.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.320]   And the verification comes in the form of signatures.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.680]   And you need ultimately some kind of guarantee
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.560]   if I write an IOU to you, bills of exchange,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.320]   I mean, you don't really know me that well,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.440]   we only just met.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.080]   So you might wanna get endorsed by, I don't know,
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.920]   somebody really credit-worthy like Elon.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.200]   And so we actually can see in the late 14th century
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.960]   in Northern Italy and in England and elsewhere,
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   the evolution of a peer-to-peer network system of payment.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.280]   And that's actually how world trade grows.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.200]   'Cause you just couldn't settle
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.080]   long oceanic transactions with coinage.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.760]   It just wasn't practical.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.320]   All those treasure chests full of doubloons,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.800]   which were part of the way
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.680]   in which the Spanish empire worked, really inefficient.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.240]   So bills of exchange are an exciting part of the story.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.520]   And they illustrate something I should have made more clear
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.320]   of the ascent of money.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.580]   That not everything used in payment needs to be money.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.960]   Classically, economists will tell you,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.360]   oh, well, money, money has three different functions.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   It's, you've heard this a zillion times, right?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.320]   It's a unit of account, it's a store of value,
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.880]   and it's a medium of exchange.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.600]   Now there are three or four things
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.880]   that are worth saying about this, and I'll just say two.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.160]   One, it may be that those three things are a trilemma,
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.520]   and it's very difficult for anything to be all of them.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.960]   This point was made by my Hoover colleague,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.480]   Manny Rincon Cruz last year,
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.720]   and I still wish he would write this up as a paper
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   because it's a great insight.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.800]   The second thing that's really interesting to me
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.920]   is that payments don't need to be money.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.480]   And if we go around as economists love to do saying,
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.920]   well, Bitcoin's not money
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.720]   because it doesn't fulfill these criteria,
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.760]   we're missing the point
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.560]   that you could build a system of payments,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.880]   which I think is how we should think about crypto,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.160]   that isn't money, doesn't need to be money.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.620]   It's like bills of exchange.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.840]   It's network-based verification, peer-to-peer transactions
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.060]   without third-party verification.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.300]   When it hit me the other day
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.560]   that we actually have this precedent for crypto,
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.620]   I got quite excited and thought,
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.600]   I wish I had written that in "The Ascent of Money."
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.800]   - Can you sort of from a first principles,
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.720]   like almost like a physics perspective
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.220]   or maybe a human perspective,
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.800]   describe where does the value of money come from?
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.560]   Like, where is it actually, where is it?
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.760]   So it's a sheet of paper or it's coins,
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.120]   but it feels like in a platonic sense,
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.200]   there's some kind of thing that's actually storing the value
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.800]   as us a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.400]   - I come from a family of physicists.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.600]   I'm the black sheep of the family.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.160]   My mother's a physicist, my sister is.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.700]   And so when you asked me to explain something
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.400]   in physics terms, I get a kind of,
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.020]   little part of me dies 'cause I know I'll fail.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.040]   But in truth, it doesn't really matter
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.440]   what we decide money is going to be.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   And anything can record, crystallize the relationship
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.680]   between the creditor and the debtor.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.400]   It can be a piece of paper, it can be a piece of metal,
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.800]   it can be nothing, can just be a digital entry.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.480]   It's trust that we're really talking about here.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.440]   We are not just trusting one another, we may not,
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.920]   but we are trusting the money.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.520]   So whatever we use to represent
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.240]   the creditor-debtor relationship,
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.200]   whether it's a banknote or a coin or whatever,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.580]   it does depend on us both trusting it.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.640]   And that doesn't always pertain.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.120]   What we see in episodes of inflation,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.900]   especially episodes of hyperinflation,
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.980]   is a crisis of trust, a crisis of confidence
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.040]   in the means of payment.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.960]   And this is very traumatic for the societies
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.900]   to which it happens.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:40.040]   By and large, human beings,
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.600]   particularly once you have a rule of law system of the sort
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.560]   that evolved in the West and then became generalized,
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.680]   are predisposed to trust one another,
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.600]   and the default setting is to trust money.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.000]   Even when it depreciates at a quite steady rate,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   as the US dollar has done pretty much uninterruptedly
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.760]   since the 1960s,
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.380]   it takes quite a big disruption
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.540]   for money to lose that trust.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.760]   But I think essentially what money should be thought of as
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.920]   is a series of tokens that can take any form we like
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.220]   and can be purely digital,
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:23.220]   which represent our transactions as creditors and debtors.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.720]   And the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.980]   I had to explain this to Stephen Colbert once
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.640]   in the Colbert Show, the old show that was actually funny.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.900]   And it was a great moment when he said,
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.980]   "So Neil, could I be money?"
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.980]   And I said, "Yes, we could settle a debt
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.260]   "with a human being."
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.720]   That was quite common in much of history,
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.800]   but it's not the most convenient.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.300]   Form of money.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.080]   Money has to be convenient.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.000]   That's why when they worked out how to make payments
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.920]   with cell phones, the Chinese simply went straight there
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.280]   from bank accounts, they skipped out credit cards.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.200]   You won't see credit cards in China,
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.880]   except in the hands of naive tourists.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.360]   - How much can this trust bear
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.160]   in terms of us humans with our human nature testing it?
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.080]   It seemed, I guess the surprising thing is the thing works.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.640]   A bunch of self-interested ants running around,
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.800]   trading in trust, and it seems to work,
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.080]   except for a bunch of moments in human history
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.480]   when there's hyperinflation, like you mentioned.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.600]   And it's just kind of amazing.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.560]   It's kind of amazing that us humans,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.600]   if I were to be optimistic and sort of hopeful
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.100]   about human nature, it gives me a sense
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.320]   that people want to lean on each other.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   They want to trust.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.960]   That's certainly, I would say probably now
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.800]   a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists,
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.080]   network scientists.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.880]   It's one of Nicholas Christakis' argument in a recent book.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.040]   I know that economic history broadly bears this out,
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.260]   but you have to be cautious.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:18.160]   The cases where the system works are familiar to us
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   because those are the states and the eras
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.680]   that produce a lot of written records.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.320]   But when the system of trust collapses
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.540]   and the monetary system collapses with it,
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.080]   there's generally quite a paucity of records.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.280]   I found that when I was writing "Doom."
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.180]   And so we slightly are biased in favor of the periods
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:47.120]   when trust prevailed and the system functioned.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.920]   It's very easy to point to a great many episodes
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.560]   of very, very intense monetary chaos,
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.040]   even in the relatively recent past.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.840]   In the wake of the First World War,
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.360]   multiple currencies, not just the German currency,
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.640]   multiple currencies were completely destroyed.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.960]   The Russian currency, the Polish currency,
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.800]   there were currency disasters all over
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.560]   Central and Eastern Europe in the early 1920s.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   And that was partly because over the course
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.840]   of the 19th century, a system had evolved
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.760]   in which trust was based on gold
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.140]   and rules that were supposedly applied by central banks.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:32.280]   That system, which produced relative price stability
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   over the 19th century, fell apart
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.800]   as a result of the First World War.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.720]   And as soon as it was gone,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.520]   as soon as there was no longer a clear link
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.000]   between those banknotes and coins and gold,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.320]   the whole thing went completely haywire.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.680]   And I think we should remember
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.280]   that the extent of the monetary chaos
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   from certainly 1918 all the way through to the late 1940s.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.960]   I mean, the German currency was destroyed
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.120]   not once but twice in that period.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   And that was one of the most advanced economies in the world.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.080]   In the United States,
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.640]   there were periods of intensely deep deflation.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.960]   Prices fell by a third in the Great Depression
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.360]   and then very serious price volatility
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.280]   in the immediate post-World War II period.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.040]   So it's a bit of an illusion.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.960]   Maybe it's an illusion for people
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.600]   who've spent most of their lives in the last 20 years.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.400]   We've had a period of exceptional price stability
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.640]   since the century began,
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.160]   in which a regime of central bank independence
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.080]   and inflation targeting appeared to generate
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.600]   steady below 2% inflation in much of the developed world.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.400]   It was a bit too low for the central bankers liking.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.040]   And that became a problem in the financial crisis.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.960]   But we've avoided major price instability
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.800]   for the better part of 20 years.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.640]   In most of the world,
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.600]   there haven't really been that many
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.040]   very high inflation episodes
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.800]   and hardly any hyperinflationary episodes.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.880]   Venezuela is one of the very few, Zimbabwe's another.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.440]   But if you take a hundred year view or a 200 year view,
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.560]   or if you want to take a 500 year view,
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.640]   you realize that quite often the system doesn't work.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   If you go back to the 17th century,
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.600]   there were multiple competing systems of coinage.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.920]   There had been a great inflation
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.960]   that had begun the previous century.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.520]   The price revolution caused mainly
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.960]   by the arrival of new world silver.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.800]   I think financial history is a bit messier
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.760]   than one might think.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.520]   And the more one studies it,
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.360]   the more one realizes the need for the evolution.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.960]   The reason bills of exchange came along
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.000]   was because the coinage systems had stopped working.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.720]   The reason that banknotes started to become used
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.080]   more generally first in the American colonies
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.960]   in the 17th century,
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.320]   then more widely in the 18th century
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.440]   was just that they were more convenient
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.320]   than any other way of paying for things.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.480]   We had to invent the bond market in the 18th century
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.200]   to cope with the problem of public debt,
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.520]   which up until that point
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.880]   had been a recurrent source of instability.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.000]   And then we invented equity finance
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.840]   because bonds were not enough.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.400]   So I would prefer to think of the financial history
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.040]   as a series of crises really
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.760]   that are resolved by innovations.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.680]   And in the most recent episode,
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.080]   very exciting episode of financial history,
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.280]   something called Bitcoin initiated a new financial
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.880]   or monetary revolution in response, I think,
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:36.080]   to the growing crisis of the fiat money system.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.640]   - Can you speak to that?
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.680]   So what do you think about Bitcoin?
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.480]   What do you think it is a response to?
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.400]   What are the growing problems of the fiat system?
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   What is this moment in human history
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.160]   that is full of challenges that Bitcoin
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.200]   and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome?
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.200]   - I don't think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.800]   whoever he was, for fear of a breakdown
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.400]   of the fiat currencies.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.200]   If it was, it was a very far-sighted enterprise
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.560]   because certainly in 2008,
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.320]   when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.080]   it wasn't very likely that a wave of inflation was coming.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.360]   If anything, there was more reason
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.240]   to fear deflation at that point.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.360]   I think it would be more accurate to say
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.800]   that with the advent of the internet,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.160]   there was a need for a means of payment
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.240]   native to the internet.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.360]   Typing your credit card number into random websites,
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.240]   not the way to pay for things on the internet.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.560]   And I'd rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.160]   the first attempt to solve the problem
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.320]   of how do we pay for things
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.760]   in what we must learn to call the metaverse,
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.480]   but let's just call it the internet for old times' sake.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.000]   And ever since that initial innovation,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.560]   the realization that you could use computing power
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.720]   and cryptography to create peer-to-peer payments
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.160]   without third-party verification,
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   a revolution has been gathering momentum
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.920]   that poses a very profound threat
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:13.040]   to the existing legacy system of banks and fiat currencies.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.600]   Most money in the world today is made by banks,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.760]   not central banks, banks.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.840]   That's what most money is, it's entries in bank accounts.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.400]   And what Bitcoin represents is an alternative mode
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.280]   of payment that really ought to render banks obsolete.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.520]   I think this financial revolution
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.440]   has got past the point at which it can be killed.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.720]   It was vulnerable in the early years,
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.360]   but it now has sufficient adoption
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.440]   and has generated sufficient additional layers.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.360]   I mean, Ethereum was in many ways
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.840]   the more important innovation
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.240]   because you can build a whole system of payments
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.960]   and ultimately smart contracts on top of Ether.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.240]   I think we've now reached the point
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.760]   that it's pretty hard to imagine it all being killed.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.600]   And it's just survived an amazing thing,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   which was the Chinese shutting down mining
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.520]   and shutting down everything.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.840]   And still here we are.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.160]   In fact, crypto's thriving.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.040]   What we don't know is how much damage
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.840]   ill-judged regulatory interventions
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.760]   are going to do to this financial revolution.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.400]   Left to its own devices,
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.560]   I think decentralized finance
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:27.360]   provides the native monetary
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.800]   and financial system for the internet.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.040]   And the more time we spend in the metaverse,
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.120]   the more use we will make of it.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.680]   The next things that will happen,
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.240]   I think will be that tokens in game spaces
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.040]   like Roblox will become fungible.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.480]   As my nine-year-old spends a lot more time
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.200]   playing on computer games than I ever did,
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.080]   I can see the entertainment
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.000]   is becoming a game-driven phenomenon.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.160]   And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:01.560]   The economics of the internet, it's evolving very fast.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560]   And in parallel,
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.440]   you can see this payments revolution happening.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.240]   I think that all goes naturally very well
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.560]   and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.640]   The problem is there are people in Washington
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.880]   with an overwhelming urge to intervene
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.560]   and disrupt this evolutionary process.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.760]   Partly, I think out of a muddled sense
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.160]   that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.760]   If we don't step in, many more will go on.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.360]   This, I think, greatly exaggerates
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.120]   how much criminal activity is in fact going on in the space.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.000]   But there's also the vested interests at work.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.440]   It was odd to me, maybe not odd,
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.560]   perhaps it wasn't surprising,
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.280]   that the Bank for International Settlements
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.480]   earlier this year published a report,
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.760]   one chapter of which said, "This must all go.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.120]   It must all stop.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.000]   It's all got to be shut down.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.360]   And it's got to be replaced by a central bank digital currency."
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.240]   And Martin Wolf in the Financial Times read this
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.800]   and said, "I agree with this."
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.720]   And one suddenly realized that the banks are clever.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.320]   They'd achieved the intellectual counter-attack
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.080]   with almost no fingerprints on the weapon.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.400]   I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:23.040]   I can't imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.640]   that essentially takes all transactions
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.400]   and puts them directly under the surveillance
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.760]   of a central government institution.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   But that suddenly is a serious counter-proposal.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:39.760]   So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized,
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.480]   technologically innovative, internet-native system
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.320]   of payments that has the possibility to evolve,
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.600]   to produce a full set of smart contracts,
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.560]   reducing enormously the transaction costs
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.560]   that we currently encounter in the financial world
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.240]   because it gets rid of all those middlemen
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.080]   who take their cut every time you take out a mortgage
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.200]   or whatever it is.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.040]   That's one alternative.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.920]   But on the other side, we have a highly centralized system
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.880]   in which transactions will by default
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.280]   be under the surveillance of the central bank.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.840]   Seems like an easy choice to me,
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.400]   but hey, I have this thing about personal liberty.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.240]   So that's where we are.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.160]   I don't think that the regulators can kill Web3.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.560]   I think we're supposed to call it Web3
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.200]   'cause crypto is now an obsolescent term.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.120]   They can't kill it,
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.320]   but they can definitely make it difficult
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.440]   and throw a lot of sand into the machine.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.160]   And I think worst of all,
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.640]   they can spoil the evolutionary story
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.640]   by creating a central bank digital currency
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.920]   that I don't think we really need,
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:47.440]   or we certainly don't need it in the Chinese form.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.680]   - So do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.280]   to take over the world?
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.000]   So become the primary,
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.440]   you mentioned the three things that make money money,
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.680]   become the primary methodology
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.840]   by which we store wealth, we exchange.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.600]   - No, no, I think what Bitcoin is,
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.120]   this was a phrase that I got from my friend,
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.840]   Matt McLennan at First Eagle,
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.760]   an option on digital gold.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.480]   So it's the gold of the system,
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.680]   but currently behaves like an option.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.320]   That's why it's quite volatile
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.760]   because we don't really know
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   if this brave new world of crypto is gonna work.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.200]   But if it does work, then Bitcoin is the gold
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.400]   because of the finite supply.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.240]   What role we need gold to play in the metaverse
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.840]   isn't quite clear.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.680]   - I love that you're using the term metaverse.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.560]   This is great.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.720]   - Well, I just like the metaversity
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.280]   as a kind of, as the antithesis
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.480]   of what we're trying to do in Austin.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.640]   - I love it.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.280]   - But can you imagine I'm using it sarcastically?
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.440]   I come from Glasgow where all novel words
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.720]   have to be used sarcastically.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.480]   So the metaverse, sarcastic.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.280]   - But see the beauty about humor and sarcasm
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.440]   is that the joke becomes reality.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.720]   I mean, it's like using the word Big Bang
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.480]   to describe the origins of the universe.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.120]   It becomes like, it will-
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.760]   - After a while it's in the textbooks
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.800]   and nobody's laughing.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.280]   Yeah, well, that's exactly right.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280]   - So sticky.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.680]   - Yeah, I'm on the side of humor,
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.320]   but it is a dangerous activity these days.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.280]   Anyway, I think Bitcoin is the option of digital gold.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.280]   The role it plays is probably not so much store of value.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.440]   Right now, it's just nicely,
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.160]   not very correlated asset in your portfolio.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.760]   When I updated "The Ascent of Money,"
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.040]   which was in 2018, 10 years after it came out,
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.200]   I wrote a new chapter in which I said,
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:48.120]   Bitcoin, which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble,
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.240]   will rise again through adoption.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.160]   Because if every millionaire in the world
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.800]   has 0.2% of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.880]   the price should be $15,000.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.280]   And if it's 1%, it's $75,000.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.000]   And it might not even stay at 1%,
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.280]   because I mean, look at its recent performance.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.560]   If your exposure to stock,
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.960]   global stocks had been hedged
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.200]   with a significant crypto holding,
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.160]   you would have aced the last few months.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:24.000]   So I think the non-correlation property
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.160]   is very, very important in driving adoption.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.200]   And the volatility also drives adoption
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.840]   if you're a sophisticated investor.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.400]   So I think the adoption drives Bitcoin up
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.120]   because it's the option of digital gold,
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.680]   but it's also just this nicely,
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.560]   not very correlated asset that you wanna hold.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.800]   In a world where, what the hell?
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.280]   I mean, the central bank's gonna tighten.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.480]   We've come through this massively disruptive episode
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.680]   of the pandemic.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.520]   Public debt soared.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.480]   Money printing soared.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.520]   You could hang around with your bonds
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.600]   and wait for the euthanasia of the rentier.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.640]   You can hang on to your tech stocks
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.480]   and just hope there isn't a massive correction
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.880]   or dot, dot, dot.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.640]   Well, and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.480]   to make sure that you have at least some crypto
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.400]   for the coming year,
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.520]   given what we likely have to face.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.840]   I think what's really interesting
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.640]   is that on top of Ethereum,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.640]   a more elaborate financial system is being built.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:32.160]   Table coins are the interesting puzzle for me
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.920]   'cause we need off-ramps.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.000]   Ultimately, you and I have to pay taxes in US dollars.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.960]   And there's no getting away from that.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.120]   The IRS is gonna let us hold crypto
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.560]   as long as we pay our taxes.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.920]   And the only question in my mind is
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.280]   what's the optimal off-ramp to make those taxes,
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.680]   make those tax payments?
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.760]   Probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by Facebook.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.720]   Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.000]   Maybe it's some kind of Fed coin.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.280]   Or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stable coins
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.760]   does the job, but we clearly need some stable off-ramp.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.880]   - So you don't think it's possible for the IRS
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.200]   within the next decade to be accepting Bitcoin
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.800]   as tax payments?
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.280]   - I doubt that.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.160]   Having dealt with the IRS now
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.840]   since when did I first come here, 2002.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.440]   It's hard to think of an institution less likely
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.440]   to leap into the 21st century when it comes to payments.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.920]   No, I think we'll be tolerated.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.480]   Crypto world will be tolerated as long as we pay our taxes.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.280]   And it's important that we're already at that point.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.560]   And then the next question becomes,
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.880]   well, does Gary Gensler define everything as a security
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.200]   and do we then have to go through
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.560]   endless regulatory contortions to satisfy the SEC?
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.720]   There's a whole bunch of uncertainties
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.440]   that the administrative state excels at creating
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.560]   'cause that's just how the administrative state works.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.800]   You'll do something new.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.920]   I'll decide whether that's a security,
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.080]   but don't expect me to define it for you.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.360]   I'll decide in an arbitrary way and then you'll owe me money.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.480]   So all of this is going to be very annoying.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.560]   And for people who are trying to run exchanges
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.600]   or innovate in the space,
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.640]   these regulations will be annoying.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.360]   But the problem with FinTech is it's different from tech,
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.160]   broadly defined.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.960]   When tech got into e-commerce with Amazon,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.400]   when it got into social networking with Facebook,
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.680]   there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate,
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.680]   but welcome to the world of finance,
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.840]   which has always been a jungle of regulation
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.960]   because the regulation is there to basically
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.280]   entrench the incumbents.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.080]   That's what it's for.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.120]   So it'll be a much tougher fight
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.040]   than the fights we've seen of other aspects
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.840]   of the tech revolution
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.600]   'cause the incumbents are there and they see the threat.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.040]   And in the end, Satoshi said it very explicitly,
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.720]   it's peer-to-peer payment without third-party verification.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.120]   And all the third parties are going, "Wait, what?
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.560]   "We're the third parties."
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.000]   - So there is a connection between power and money.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.120]   You've mentioned World War I from the perspective of money.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.120]   So power, money, war, authoritarian regimes.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.320]   From the perspective of money,
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:42.120]   do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war,
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.240]   can help resist the negative effects
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.940]   of authoritarian regimes?
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.380]   Or is that a silly hope?
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:57.580]   - Wars happen because the people
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:03.340]   who have the power to command armed forces miscalculate.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.380]   That's generally what happens.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:12.140]   And we will have a big war in the near future
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.220]   if both the Chinese government
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.020]   and the US government miscalculates
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:20.300]   and they unleash lethal force on one another.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.180]   And there's nothing that any financial institution
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.180]   can do to stop that
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:29.340]   any more than the Rothschilds could stop World War I.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.780]   And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:35.580]   with massive international financial influence.
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:39.380]   So let's accept that war is in a different domain.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:45.100]   War would impact the financial world massively
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.620]   if it were a war between the United States and China
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:52.380]   because there's still a huge China trade on.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:55.940]   Wall Street is long China, Europe is long China.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:59.520]   So the conflict that I can foresee in the future
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.900]   is one that's highly financially disruptive.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.220]   Where does crypto fit in?
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:09.900]   Crypto's obvious utility in the short run
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:13.820]   is as a store of wealth, of transferable wealth
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:17.060]   for people who live in dangerous places
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.540]   with failing, not just failing money,
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.440]   but failing rule of law.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.740]   That's why in Latin America
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.460]   there's so much interest in crypto
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.580]   because Latin Americans have a lot of monetary history
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.740]   to look back on and not much of it is good.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:34.940]   So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves is,
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:39.060]   and this goes back to the digital gold point,
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.020]   if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.700]   and weak property rights,
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.300]   here is a new and better way to have portable wealth.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:56.060]   I think the next question to ask is,
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.860]   would you want to be long crypto
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.820]   in the event of World War III?
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:03.560]   What's interesting about that question
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.260]   is that World War III would likely have
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.480]   a significant cyber dimension to it.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.900]   And I don't wanna be 100% in crypto
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.020]   if they crash the internet,
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.420]   which between them, China and Russia might be able to do.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:19.940]   That's a fascinating question
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:22.620]   whether you want to be holding physical gold
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:25.980]   or digital gold in the event of World War III.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.840]   The smart person who studied history
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.420]   definitely wants better both.
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:34.020]   And so let's imagine World War III
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.900]   has a very, very severe cyber component to it
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.260]   with high levels of disruption.
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:44.100]   Yeah, you'd be glad of the old shiny stuff at that point.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:49.100]   So diversification still seems like the most important truth
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:52.620]   of financial history.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.060]   And what is crypto?
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:57.200]   It's just this wonderful new source of diversification,
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.380]   but you'd be nuts to be 100% in Bitcoin.
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.580]   I mean, I have some friends
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.580]   who are probably quite close to that.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.420]   - Close to 100%, yeah.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:10.380]   - I'd mar the balls of steel.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:16.860]   - Yeah, in whatever way that balls of steel takes form.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:20.140]   You mentioned smart contracts.
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.780]   What are your thoughts about,
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:23.620]   in the context of the history of money,
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.620]   about Ethereum, about smart contracts,
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:30.620]   about kind of more systematic at scale formalization
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:33.460]   of agreements between humans?
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:39.500]   - I think it must be the case
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:45.540]   that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant.
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:52.300]   That when we are confronted with pages and pages and pages
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.820]   and pages of small prints,
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:58.060]   we're seeing some manifestation
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.180]   of the late stage regulatory state.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.320]   The transaction itself is quite simple.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:08.460]   And most of the verbiage is just ass covering by regulators.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.340]   So I think the smart contract,
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.020]   although I'm sure lawyers will email me
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.700]   and tell me I'm wrong,
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:20.380]   can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:24.060]   and maybe not so plain transactions that we want to do
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:28.580]   and eliminate yet more intermediaries.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.940]   That's my kind of working assumption.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.940]   And given that a lot of financial transactions
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:42.540]   have the potential at least to be simplified, automated,
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.380]   turned into smart contracts,
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.380]   that's probably where the future goes.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:51.900]   I can't see an obvious reason why my range
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:54.100]   of different financial needs,
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.540]   let's think about insurance, for example,
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:35:00.940]   will continue to be met with instruments
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:04.260]   that in some ways are a hundred years old.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:08.620]   So I think we're still at an early stage
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.420]   of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:17.100]   how we take care of all those financial needs that we have,
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.860]   mortgages and insurance leap to mind.
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:23.380]   You know, most households are penalized
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.100]   for being financially poorly educated
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.660]   and confronted with oligopolistic
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.620]   financial services providers.
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:35.740]   So you kind of leave college already in debt.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:40.340]   So you start in debt servitude,
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:43.380]   and then you got to somehow lever up
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.260]   to buy a home if you can,
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.500]   'cause everybody's kind of telling you you should do that.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.380]   So you and your spouse,
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:53.100]   you are getting even more leveraged
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:57.380]   and your long one asset class called real estate,
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:59.540]   which is super illiquid.
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:03.980]   I mean, already I'm crying inside at the thought
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.540]   of describing so many households' financial predicament
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.060]   in that way, and I'm not done with them yet
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.660]   because, oh, by the way,
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.180]   there's all this insurance you have to take out.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.380]   And here are the providers that are willing to insure you,
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:17.740]   and here are the premiums you're gonna be paying,
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.300]   which are kind of presented to you.
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:22.220]   That's your car insurance, that's your home insurance,
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.820]   and if you're here, it's the earthquake insurance.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.460]   And pretty soon you're just bleeding money
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:30.940]   in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage lender,
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.620]   to the insurer, to all the other people that lent you money.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:37.420]   And let's look at your balance sheet.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:39.340]   It sucks.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:41.220]   There's this great big chunk of real estate,
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.660]   and what else have you really got on there?
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.340]   And the other side is a bunch of debt,
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:48.340]   which is probably paying too high interest.
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.100]   The typical household in the median kind of range
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   is at the mercy of oligopolistic financial services providers
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:01.220]   go down further in the social scale,
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.780]   and people are outside the financial system altogether.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:07.540]   And those poor folks have to rely on bank notes
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:10.940]   and informal lending with huge punitive rates.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.100]   We have to do better.
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:15.340]   This has to be improved upon.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:17.380]   And I think what's exciting about our time
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.540]   is that technology now exists
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.700]   that didn't exist when I wrote "The Ascent of Money"
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.660]   to solve these problems.
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.340]   When I wrote "The Ascent of Money," which was in 2008,
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:30.380]   you couldn't really solve the problem I've just described.
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.620]   Certainly you couldn't solve it
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.980]   with something like microfinance.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.780]   That was obviously not viable.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.100]   The interest rates were high,
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.700]   the transaction costs were crazy,
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.020]   but now we have solutions,
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.980]   and the solutions are extremely exciting.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.140]   So fintech is this great force for good
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:48.820]   that brings people into the financial system
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.860]   and reduces transaction costs.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.220]   Crypto is part of it, but it's just part of it.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:55.860]   There's a much broader story of fintech going on here
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:59.620]   where you get, suddenly you get financial services
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.460]   on your phone, don't cost nearly as much as they did
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.060]   when there had to be a bricks and mortar building
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:08.180]   on Main Street that you kind of went humbly
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.380]   and beseeched to lend you money.
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.580]   I'm excited about that
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.700]   because it seems to me very socially transformative.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:17.620]   I'll give you one other example of what's great.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.540]   The people who really get scalped in our financial system
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.780]   are senders and receivers of remittances,
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:29.020]   which are often amongst the poorest families in the world.
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:32.340]   The people who are like my wife's family in East Africa,
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.460]   really kind of hand to mouth.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.420]   And if you send money to East Africa
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.780]   or the Philippines or Central America,
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.820]   the transaction costs are awful.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:46.060]   I'm talking to you, Western Union.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.220]   (laughs)
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.220]   We're gonna solve that problem.
[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.180]   So 10 years from now,
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.500]   the transaction costs will just be negligible
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500]   and the money will go to the people who need it
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:58.140]   rather than to rent seeking financial institutions.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.900]   So I'm on the side of the revolution with this
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.700]   because I think the incumbent financial institutions
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.820]   globally are doing a pretty terrible job
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:10.340]   and middle-class and lower-class families lose out.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.900]   And thankfully, technology allows us to fix this.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:16.180]   - Yeah, so FinTech can remove a lot of inefficiencies
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.100]   in the system.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.940]   I'm super excited myself,
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.060]   maybe as a machine learning person in the data oracles.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:26.140]   So converting a lot of our physical world into data
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:29.220]   and have smart contracts on top of that
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.660]   so that no longer is there's this fuzziness
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:36.640]   about what is the concrete nature of the agreements.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:39.860]   You can tie your agreement to weather.
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:42.780]   You can tie your agreement to the behavior
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:46.300]   of certain kinds of financial systems.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.740]   You can tie your behavior to, I don't know,
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:50.780]   I mean, all kinds of things.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.300]   You can connect it to the body
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:55.980]   in terms of human sensory information.
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:58.420]   Like you can make an agreement
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:03.220]   that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month,
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.620]   you're going to pay me $1,000 or something like that.
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:06.460]   I don't know.
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.180]   It's a stupid example, but it's not
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.120]   because you can create all kinds of services on top of that.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.140]   You can just create all kinds of interesting applications
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.800]   that completely revolutionize how humans transact.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.780]   - I think, of course, we don't want to create a world
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:29.620]   of Chinese style social credit
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:34.460]   in which our behavior becomes so transparent
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:38.140]   to providers of financial services, particularly insurers,
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.100]   that when I try to go into the pub,
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.920]   I'm stopped from doing so.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:47.220]   - Every time you take a drink, your insurance goes up.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:48.220]   (laughing)
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:51.380]   - Right, or my credit card won't work
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:56.140]   in certain restaurants because they serve rib eye steak.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:59.140]   I fear that world 'cause I see it being built in China.
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:02.940]   And we must, at all costs, make sure
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:07.540]   that the Western world has something distinctive to offer.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.900]   It can't just be, oh, it's the same as in China,
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:13.620]   only the data go to five tech companies
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.920]   rather than to Xi Jinping.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.740]   So I think that the way we need to steer this world
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:26.740]   is in the way that our data
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:31.100]   are by default vaulted on our devices,
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.380]   and we choose when to release the data
[01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.020]   rather than the default setting
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.100]   being that the data are available.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.140]   That's important, I think,
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.060]   because it was one of the biggest mistakes
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.460]   of the evolution of the internet
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:50.060]   that in a way the default was to let our data be plundered.
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:53.740]   It's hard to undo that, but I think we can at least
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.740]   create a new regime that in future makes privacy default
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:02.120]   rather than open access default.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:07.980]   - In the book "Doom, the Politics of Catastrophe,"
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:11.900]   your newest book, you describe wars, pandemics,
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.300]   and the terrible disasters in human history.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:17.900]   Which stands out to you as the worst
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.020]   in terms of how much it shook the world
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.280]   and the human spirit?
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:28.700]   - I am glad I was not around in the mid 14th century
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:32.600]   when the bubonic plague swept across Eurasia.
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.340]   As far as we can see, that was history's worst pandemic.
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:40.300]   Maybe there was a comparably bad one
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.660]   in the reign of the Emperor Justinian,
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.860]   but there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:51.500]   And the more we learn about the 14th century,
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:54.420]   the more we realize that it really was across Eurasia
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   and the mortality was 30% in some places, 50%
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.500]   in some places higher.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.800]   There were whole towns that were just emptied.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.460]   And when one reads about the Black Death,
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:12.460]   it's an unimaginable nightmare of death
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:17.740]   and madness in the death with flagellant orders
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:20.460]   wandering from town to town,
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.760]   seeking to ward off divine retribution
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.860]   by flogging themselves,
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:26.980]   people turning on the local Jewish communities
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:28.940]   as if it's somehow their fault.
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:32.420]   That must've been a nightmarish time.
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:36.740]   If you ask me for an also ran a runner up,
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:42.160]   it would be World War II in Eastern Europe.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:46.260]   And in many ways, it might have been worse
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:50.380]   because for a medieval peasant,
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:53.760]   the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.340]   must've been overpowering.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.380]   In the mid 20th century,
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:04.180]   you knew that this was man-made murder
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.340]   on a massive industrial scale.
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:10.560]   If one reads Brosman's "Life and Fate,"
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.900]   just to take one example,
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:17.900]   one enters a hellscape that it's extremely hard
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:22.140]   to imagine oneself in.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:25.540]   So these are two of the great disasters of human history.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.100]   And if we did have a time machine,
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.020]   if one really were able to transport people back
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:35.540]   and give them a glimpse of these times,
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.140]   I think the post-traumatic stress would be enormous.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.360]   People would come back from those trips,
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.100]   even if it was a one-day excursion with guaranteed survival
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.160]   in a state of utter shock.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.180]   - You often explore counterfactual and hypothetical history,
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.700]   which is a fascinating thing to do,
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.880]   sometimes to a controversial degree.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.780]   And again, you walk through that fire gracefully.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:06.660]   So let me ask maybe about World War II or in general,
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:12.380]   what key moments in history of the 20th century
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.860]   do you think if something else happened at those moments,
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.260]   we could have avoided some of the big atrocities,
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:21.180]   Stalin's Haldimard, Hitler's Holocaust,
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.840]   Mao's Great Chinese Famine?
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:28.440]   - The great turning point in world history
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.880]   is August the 2nd, 1914,
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:38.560]   when the British cabinet decides to intervene
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.640]   and what would have been a European war
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.880]   becomes a world war.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.360]   And with British intervention,
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.680]   it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.280]   So very early in my career,
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.720]   I became very preoccupied with the deliberations on that day
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:02.160]   and the surprising decision that a liberal cabinet took
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.560]   to go to war,
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.500]   which you might not have bet on that morning
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:10.680]   because there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.960]   who would be disinclined and only a minority,
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.280]   including Winston Churchill, who wanted to go to war.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.760]   So that's one turning point.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.160]   I often wish I could get my time machine working
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.640]   and go back and say, wait, stop,
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.300]   just think about what you're going to do.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:28.920]   And by the way, let me show you a video of Europe in 1918.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:29.760]   So that's one.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.480]   - Can we linger on that one?
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:36.480]   That one, a lot of people push back on you on,
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.360]   because it's so difficult.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.720]   So the idea is, if I could try to summarize,
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:46.400]   and you're the first person that made me think
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.360]   about this very uncomfortable thought,
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.320]   which is the idea is in World War I,
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.560]   it would be a better world if Britain stayed out of the war
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:00.480]   and Germany won.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.320]   - Right.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.920]   - Thinking now in retrospect
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.960]   at the whole story of the 20th century,
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.920]   thinking about Stalin's rule of 30 years,
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.520]   thinking about Hitler's rise to power
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:18.360]   and the atrocities of the Holocaust,
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.320]   but also, like you said, on the Eastern front,
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:25.960]   the death of tens of millions of people throughout the war,
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.600]   and also sort of the political prisoners
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.680]   and the suffering connected to communism,
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.080]   connected to fascism, all those kinds of things.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.880]   Well, that's one heck of an example
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:42.000]   of why you're just like fearless in this particular style
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.120]   of exploring counterfactual history.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:47.400]   So can you elaborate on that idea
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.200]   and maybe why this was such an important day
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.200]   in human history?
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:55.120]   - This argument was central to my book, "The Pity of War."
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.360]   I also did an essay in "Virtual History" about this,
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.200]   and it's always amused me that from around that time,
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.240]   I began to be called a conservative historian
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.560]   because it's actually a very left-wing argument.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.920]   The people in 1914 who thought Britain should stay
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:10.560]   at the war were the left of the Labor Party,
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.960]   who split to become the independent Labor Party.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.120]   What would have happened?
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.960]   Well, first of all, Britain was not ready for war in 1914.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.120]   There had not been conscription.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.120]   The army was tiny.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:25.640]   So Britain had failed to deter Germany.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.880]   The Germans took the decision that they could risk
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.040]   going through Belgium, using the Schlieffen plan
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.720]   to fight their two-front war.
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.560]   They calculated that Britain's intervention
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.520]   would either not happen or not matter.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   If Britain had been strategically committed
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.960]   to preventing Germany winning a war in Europe,
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:51.280]   they should have introduced conscription 10 years before,
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:53.440]   had a meaningful land army,
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.800]   and that would have deterred the Germans.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.320]   So the liberal government provided the worst of both worlds,
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.360]   a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.480]   that the public didn't know about,
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:07.640]   in fact, much of the Liberal Party didn't know about,
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.560]   but without really the means
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.320]   to make that intervention effective,
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.400]   a tiny army with just a few divisions.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.040]   So it was perfectly reasonable to argue,
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.720]   as a number of people did on August the 2nd, 1914,
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.560]   that Britain should not intervene.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.560]   After all, Britain had not immediately intervened
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:27.160]   against the French Revolutionary armies back in the 1790s.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:30.480]   It had played an offshore role, ultimately intervening,
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.840]   but not immediately intervening.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.240]   If Britain had stayed out,
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.440]   I don't think that France would have collapsed immediately
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.400]   as it had in 1870.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.440]   The French held up remarkably well to catastrophic casualties
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.800]   in the first six months of the First World War.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:52.400]   But by 1916, I don't see how France could have kept going
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.840]   if Britain had not joined the war.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.200]   And I think the war would have been over
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.200]   perhaps at some point in 1916.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.520]   We know that Germany's aims
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.320]   would have been significantly limited
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.480]   because they would have needed to keep Britain out.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:06.160]   If they'd succeeded in keeping Britain out,
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.680]   they'd have had to keep Britain out.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:08.720]   And the way to keep Britain out
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.880]   was obviously not to make any annexation of Belgium,
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:14.080]   to limit German war aims,
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.520]   particularly to limit them to Eastern Europe.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.120]   And from Britain's point of view, what was not to like?
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:23.280]   So the Russian Empire is defeated along with France.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.520]   What does that really change?
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.800]   If the Germans are sensible
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.840]   and we can see what this might've looked like,
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.880]   they focus on Eastern Europe,
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.440]   they take chunks of the Russian Empire,
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.600]   perhaps they create as they did
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.440]   in the piece of Brest-Litovsk,
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:47.160]   an independent or quasi-independent Poland.
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.440]   In no way does that pose a threat to the British Empire.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.160]   In fact, it's a good thing.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:54.440]   Britain never had had a particularly good relationship
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.120]   with the Russian Empire after all.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:59.440]   The key point here is that the Germany
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:02.240]   that emerges from victory in 1916
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:05.000]   has a kind of European Union.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.080]   It's the dominant power of an enlarged Germany
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:12.880]   with a significant Mitteleuropa,
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.800]   whatever you want to call it,
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:17.360]   customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries,
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:20.240]   including one suspects Austria-Hungary.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:27.160]   That is a very different world from the world of 1917-18.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:31.080]   The protraction of the war for a further two years,
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.200]   its globalization,
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.600]   which Britain's intervention made inevitable.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:39.400]   As Philip Zelikow showed in his recent book
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.480]   on the failure to make peace in 1916,
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.040]   Woodrow Wilson tried and failed to intervene
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.680]   and broker a peace in 1916.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.760]   So I'm not the only counterfactualist here.
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.360]   The extension of the war for a further two years
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.040]   with escalating slaughter,
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:58.560]   the death toll rose because the industrial capacity
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.440]   of the armies grew greater.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.400]   That's what condemns us to the Bolshevik revolution.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:08.040]   And it's what condemns us ultimately to Nazism
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:13.760]   because it's out of the experience of defeat in 1918,
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.600]   as Hitler makes clear in "Mein Kampf"
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:19.320]   that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.920]   Take out those additional years of war
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:26.160]   and Hitler's just a failed artist.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:31.160]   It's the end of the war that turns him into the demagogue.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.880]   You asked what are the things
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.880]   that avoid the totalitarian states.
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.360]   As I've said, British non-intervention for me
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.840]   is the most plausible
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.760]   and it takes out all of that malignant history
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:48.280]   that follows from the Bolshevik revolution.
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:51.000]   It's very hard for me to see how Lenin gets anywhere
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.320]   if the war is over.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.280]   That looks like the opportunity
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.800]   for the constitutional elements,
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:02.600]   the liberal elements in Russia.
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.360]   There are other moments at which you can imagine
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.440]   history taking a different path.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:12.560]   If the provisional government in Russia
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.040]   had been more ruthless,
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.480]   it was very lenient towards the Bolsheviks.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.080]   But if it had just rounded them up
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.760]   and shot the Bolshevik leadership,
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:25.000]   that would have certainly cut the Bolshevik revolution off.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.160]   One looks back on the conduct of the Russian liberals
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:32.120]   with the kind of despair at their failure
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.720]   to see the scale of the threat that they face
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:35.640]   and the ruthlessness
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:38.520]   that the Bolshevik leadership would evince.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.120]   There's a counterfactual in Germany, which is interesting.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:44.960]   I think the Weimar Republic destroyed itself
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:49.760]   in two disastrous economic calamities,
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.800]   the inflation and then the deflation.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.720]   It's difficult for me to imagine Hitler
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.160]   getting to be Reich Chancellor
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.000]   without those huge economic disasters.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.920]   So another part of my early work
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.520]   explored alternative policy options
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.760]   that the German Republic,
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:09.920]   the Weimar Republic might've pursued.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.160]   There are other contingencies that spring to mind.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:17.800]   In 1936 or '38, I think more plausibly '38,
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:21.200]   Britain should have gone to war.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.920]   The great mistake was Munich.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:29.080]   Hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938,
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.520]   because remember, he didn't have Russia squared away
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.840]   as he would in 1939.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.360]   Chamberlain's mistake was to fold
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:41.120]   instead of going for war, as Churchill rightly saw.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.320]   And there was a magical opportunity there
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.480]   that would have played into the hands
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:48.120]   of the German military opposition and conservatives
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:52.920]   to snuff Hitler out over Czechoslovakia.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.760]   I could go on.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:58.760]   The point is that history is not some inexorable narrative
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.160]   which can only end one way.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:03.720]   It's a garden of forking paths.
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:08.280]   And at many, many junctions in the road,
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.880]   there were choices that could have averted
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:14.360]   the calamities of the mid 20th century.
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.400]   - I have to ask you about this moment
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.080]   before you said I could go on.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:20.560]   This moment of Chamberlain and Hitler,
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:24.280]   snuff Hitler out in terms of Czechoslovakia.
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:29.040]   And we'll return to the book "Doom" on this point.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:32.240]   What does it take to be a great leader
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.240]   in the room with Hitler or in the same time and space
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:42.200]   as Hitler to snuff him out, to make the right decisions?
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:46.720]   So it sounds like you put quite a bit of the blame
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:51.200]   on the man, Chamberlain, and give credit
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:53.320]   to somebody like a Churchill.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.240]   So what is the difference?
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.360]   Where's that line?
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.880]   You've also written a book about Henry Kissinger
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:01.160]   who's an interesting sort of person
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:04.780]   that's been throughout many difficult decisions
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:06.160]   in the games of power.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:08.480]   So what does it take to be a great leader in that moment?
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.600]   That particular moment, sorry to keep talking,
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.240]   is fascinating to me.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.760]   'Cause it feels like it's man on man conversations
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.640]   that define history.
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:19.600]   - Well, Hitler was bluffing.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.720]   He really wasn't ready for war in 1938.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.720]   The German economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:30.720]   And Chamberlain made a fundamental miscalculation
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.680]   along with his advisors, 'cause it wasn't all Chamberlain.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.680]   He was in many ways articulating the establishment view.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:41.420]   And I tried to show in a book called "War of the World"
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.720]   how that establishment worked.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.040]   It extended through the BBC
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.820]   into the aristocracy to Oxford.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:48.000]   There was an establishment view.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.760]   Chamberlain personified it.
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.020]   Churchill was seen as a warmonger.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:56.280]   He was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.080]   But what is it that Chamberlain gets wrong?
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.760]   'Cause it's conceptual.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:03.680]   Chamberlain is persuaded that Britain has to play for time
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.800]   because Britain is not ready for war in 1938.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.800]   He fails to see that the time that he gets,
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.520]   that he buys at Munich is also available to Hitler.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.200]   Everybody gets the time.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.000]   And Hitler's able to do much more with it
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.880]   because Hitler strikes the pact with Stalin
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:23.680]   that guarantees that Germany can fight a war
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:25.960]   on one front in 1939.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.880]   What does Chamberlain do?
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.760]   Build some more aircraft.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.360]   So the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:32.820]   was to play for time.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:34.160]   I mean, they knew war was coming,
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:35.120]   but they were playing for time,
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:39.200]   not realizing that Hitler got the time too.
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:42.040]   And after he partitioned Czechoslovakia,
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:43.800]   he was in a much stronger position,
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.420]   not least because of all the resources
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:50.420]   that they were able to plunder from Czechoslovakia.
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:52.760]   So that was the conceptual mistake.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.760]   Churchill played an heroic role in pointing out this mistake
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:00.960]   and predicting accurately
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.100]   that it would lead to war on worse terms.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.700]   What does it take?
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:10.700]   It takes a distinct courage to be unpopular.
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:13.680]   And Churchill was deeply unpopular at that point.
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:16.520]   People would listen to him in the House of Commons
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:17.760]   in silence.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.020]   On one occasion, Lady Astor shouted, "Rubbish!"
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:25.300]   So he went through a period of being hated on.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:29.100]   The other thing that made Churchill a formidable leader
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.820]   was that he always applied history to the problem.
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:35.140]   And that's why he gets it right.
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.420]   He sees the historical problem
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:39.900]   much more clearly than Chamberlain.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:44.340]   So I think if you go back to 1938,
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.900]   there's no realistic counterfactual
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:48.000]   in which Churchill's in government in 1938.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.820]   You have to have France collapse
[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:51.900]   for Churchill to come into government.
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:56.900]   But you can certainly imagine a Tory elite
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:02.260]   that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics.
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:06.340]   They haven't seen this, I guess, problem of conjecture
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:08.900]   to take a phrase from Kissinger,
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:13.820]   which is that whatever they're doing in postponing the war
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.940]   has the potential to create a worse starting point
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.780]   for the war.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:21.900]   It would have been risky in 1938,
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.640]   but it was a way better situation
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:27.280]   than they ended up with in 1939, a year later.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:28.940]   You asked about Kissinger, and I've learned a lot
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:33.180]   from reading Kissinger and talking to Kissinger
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:35.780]   since I embarked on writing his biography
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:37.140]   a great many years ago.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:40.740]   I think one of the most important things I've learned
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:46.600]   is that you can apply history to contemporary problems.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.720]   It may be the most important tool that we have
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.820]   in that kind of decision-making.
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.440]   You have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously.
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:03.380]   And in the moment of crisis, you have to take risk.
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:08.380]   So Kissinger often says in his early work,
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:12.260]   the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data,
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:14.500]   but ultimately the decision-making
[02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:18.460]   that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.260]   The problem of conjecture is that you could take an action
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:26.260]   now and incur some cost, an overt disaster,
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:28.700]   but you'll get no thanks for it
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:31.200]   'cause nobody is grateful for an averted disaster.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.340]   And nobody goes around saying,
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:36.340]   "Wasn't it wonderful how we didn't have another 9/11?"
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:40.780]   On the other hand, you can do nothing,
[02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:44.140]   incur no upfront costs and hope for the best,
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:47.460]   and you might get lucky, the disaster might not happen.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:52.460]   That's in a democratic system, the much easier path to take.
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:59.300]   And I think the essence of leadership is to be ready
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:02.020]   to take that upfront cost, avert the disaster,
[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:04.020]   and accept that you won't get gratitude.
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:10.340]   - If I may make a comment, an aside about Henry Kissinger.
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:15.400]   So he, I think at 98 years old currently, has still got it.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.700]   - Yeah. - He's brilliant.
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:18.980]   - It's very, very impressive.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:23.260]   I can only hope that my brain has the same durability
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:26.060]   that his does because it's a formidable intellect
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:31.060]   and it's still in as sharp form as it was 50 years ago.
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:34.260]   - So you mentioned Eric Schmidt and his book,
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:37.020]   and they reached out to me, they wanna do this podcast.
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:41.420]   And I know Eric Schmidt, I've spoken to him before,
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.100]   I like him a lot, obviously.
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:47.340]   So they said, "We could do a podcast
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:49.940]   "for 40 minutes with Eric,
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.640]   "40 minutes with Eric and Henry together,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.020]   "and 40 minutes with Henry."
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:58.120]   So those are three different conversations.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.980]   And I had to do some soul searching.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.780]   'Cause I said, "Fine, 40 minutes with Eric,
[02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:04.740]   "we'll probably talk many times again.
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:07.060]   "Fine, let's talk about this AI book
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:09.260]   "together for 40 minutes."
[02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:11.180]   But I said, what I wrote to them, I said,
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.320]   "I would hate myself if I only have 40 minutes
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.660]   "to talk to Henry Kissinger."
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:18.860]   And so I had to hold my ground, went back and forth,
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:21.180]   and in the end decided to part ways over this.
[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:25.860]   And I sometimes think about this kind of difficult decision
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:32.900]   in the podcasting space of when do you walk away?
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:38.940]   Because there's a particular world leader
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:40.540]   that I've mentioned in the past
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:43.940]   where the conversation is very likely to happen.
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:48.940]   And as it happens, those conversations could often be,
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.380]   unfortunately, this person only has 30 minutes now.
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:56.060]   I know we agreed for three hours, but unfortunately.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:01.060]   And you have to decide, do I stand my ground on this point?
[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:03.220]   I suppose that's the thing that journalists
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:04.580]   have to think about, right?
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:09.580]   Like, do I hold onto my integrity
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:11.420]   in whatever form that takes?
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.540]   And do I stay my ground
[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:16.180]   even if I lose a fascinating opportunity?
[02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.980]   Anyway, it's something I thought about
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.780]   and something I think about.
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:21.700]   And with Henry Kissinger, I mean,
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:25.780]   he's had a million amazing conversations in your biography,
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.300]   so it's not like something is lost,
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.940]   but it was still nevertheless, to me,
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:30.820]   some soul searching that I had to do
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.620]   as a kind of practice for what to me
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:36.860]   is a higher stakes conversation.
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:38.940]   I'll just mention it as Vladimir Putin.
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:41.780]   I can have a conversation with him
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:44.460]   unlike any conversation he's ever had,
[02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:47.860]   partially because I'm a fluent Russian speaker,
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.660]   partially because I'm messed up in the head
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:52.780]   in certain kind of ways that make for an interesting dynamic
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.420]   because we're both judo people,
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:58.580]   we both are certain kinds of human beings
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:01.300]   that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation.
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:05.900]   I have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership.
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.380]   You've, in your book "Doom,"
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:12.360]   have talked about wars, pandemics throughout human history,
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.380]   and in some sense saying
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:19.440]   that all of these disasters are man-made.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.580]   So humans have a role in terms of the magnitude
[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:26.140]   of the effect that they have on human civilization.
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:30.240]   Without taking cheap political shots,
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:32.140]   can we talk about COVID-19?
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:38.060]   How will history remember the COVID-19 pandemic?
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:39.500]   What were the successes?
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:44.500]   What were the failures of leadership, of man, of humans?
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:50.500]   - "Doom" was a book that I was planning to write
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:56.540]   before the pandemic struck as a history of the future
[02:04:56.540 --> 02:04:59.660]   based in large measure on science fiction.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.540]   It had occurred to me in 2019
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:04.380]   that I had spent too long not reading science fiction.
[02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:09.380]   And so I decided I would liven up my intake
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:14.020]   by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.260]   'Cause history is great at telling you
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:18.540]   about the perennial problems of power.
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.900]   Putin is always interesting on history.
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:23.100]   He's become something of a historian recently
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:25.780]   with his essays and lectures.
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:27.460]   But what history is bad at telling you is,
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:28.520]   well, what will the effects
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:31.740]   of discontinuity of technology be?
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:33.340]   And so I thought, I need some science fiction
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:34.420]   to think more about this,
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:38.340]   'cause I'm tending to miss the importance
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.100]   of technological discontinuity.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:43.020]   If you read a lot of science fiction,
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:45.580]   you read a lot of plague books,
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:48.700]   'cause science fiction writers are really quite fond
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:50.260]   of the plague scenario.
[02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:52.460]   So the world ends in many ways in science fiction,
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:54.640]   but one of the most popular is "The Lethal Pandemic."
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:58.500]   So when the first email came to me,
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:05:59.900]   I think it was on January the 3rd
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.860]   from my medical friend, Justin Stebbing,
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:06.860]   "Funny pneumonia in Wuhan," my antennae began to tingle,
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:10.260]   because it was just like one of those science fiction books
[02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.840]   that begins in just that way.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.600]   (mouse clicking)
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:18.800]   In a pandemic, as Larry Brilliant,
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:20.800]   the epidemiologist said many years ago,
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:25.400]   the key is early detection and early action.
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:27.500]   That's how you deal with a novel pathogen.
[02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:30.720]   And almost no Western country did that.
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.800]   We know it was doable because the Taiwanese
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:36.740]   and the South Koreans did it, and they did it very well.
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:41.400]   But really no Western country got this right.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.920]   Some were unlucky because super spreader events
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:46.200]   happened earlier than in other countries.
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.520]   Italy was hit very hard very early.
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:51.040]   For other countries, the real disaster came quite late,
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.000]   Russia, which has only relatively recently
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.020]   had a really bad experience.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:59.960]   The lesson for me is quite different
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:02.000]   from the one that most journalists
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.880]   thought they were learning last year.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:06.360]   Most journalists last year thought,
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.320]   Trump is a terrible president.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.700]   He's saying a lot of crazy things.
[02:07:10.700 --> 02:07:13.220]   It's his fault that we have high excess mortality
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:15.060]   in the United States.
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:18.000]   The same argument was being made by journalists in Britain,
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.560]   Boris Johnson, dot, dot, dot, Brazil,
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.240]   Jared Bolsonaro, dot, dot, dot,
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.540]   even India, Narendra Modi, the same argument.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:30.680]   And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:35.160]   It's true that the populist leaders said many crazy things
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.520]   and broadly speaking, gave poor guidance
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.680]   to their populations.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:43.480]   But I don't think it's true to say
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:44.620]   that with different leaders,
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:46.920]   these countries would have done significantly better
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.400]   if Joe Biden had magically been president a year earlier.
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.360]   I don't think the US would have done much better
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.560]   because the things that caused excess mortality last year
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:57.020]   weren't presidential decisions.
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:08:00.920]   They were utter failure of CDC to provide testing.
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.960]   That definitely wasn't Trump's fault.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:04.880]   Scott Gottlieb's book makes that very clear.
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.840]   It's just been published recently.
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:10.160]   We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:12.560]   which the Koreans did very well.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:16.600]   We didn't really quarantine anybody seriously.
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:19.120]   There was no enforcement of quarantine.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.080]   And we exposed the elderly to the virus
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:23.440]   as quickly as possible in elderly care homes.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.700]   And these things had very little to do
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.080]   with presidential incompetence.
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:33.080]   So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal importance
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.680]   in a crisis like this,
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:37.160]   'cause what you really need is your public health bureaucracy
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.080]   to get it right.
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.560]   And very few Western public health bureaucracies
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.160]   got it right.
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.440]   Could the president have given better leadership?
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.080]   Yes.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.360]   His correct strategy, however,
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:52.740]   was to learn from Barack Obama's playbook
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:55.200]   with the opioid epidemic.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:59.400]   The opioid epidemic killed as many people on Obama's watch
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:01.840]   as COVID did on Trump's watch.
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.160]   And it was worse in the sense
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:05.040]   because it only happened in the US,
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:07.820]   and each year it killed more people than the year before
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.200]   over eight years.
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.680]   Nobody to my knowledge has ever seriously blamed Obama
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.800]   for the opioid epidemic.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:17.600]   Trump's mistake was to put himself front and center
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:18.440]   of the response,
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.160]   to claim that he had some unique insight into the pandemic
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.840]   and to say with every passing week
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:26.080]   more and more foolish things
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:29.160]   until even a significant portion of people
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:32.080]   who'd voted for him in 2016 realized that he'd blown it,
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:34.160]   which was why he lost the election.
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:37.800]   The correct strategy was actually to make Mike Pence
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:40.920]   the pandemic czar and get the hell out of the way.
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:42.680]   That's what my advice to Trump would have been.
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:45.640]   In fact, it was in February of last year.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:48.960]   So the mistake was to try to lead,
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:52.520]   but actually leadership in a pandemic
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:54.000]   is almost a contradiction in terms.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.600]   What you really need is your public health bureaucracy
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:58.320]   not to fuck it up.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.400]   And they really, really fucked it up.
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.120]   And that was then all blamed on Trump.
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:02.960]   - Yes.
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:05.280]   - Jim Fallows writes a piece in "The Atlantic" that says,
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:07.680]   "Well, being the president's like flying a light aircraft
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.000]   "it's pilot error."
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.520]   And I read that piece and I thought,
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.160]   does he really, after all the years he spent writing,
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:16.160]   think that being president is like flying a light aircraft?
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:19.160]   I mean, it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft.
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:22.360]   Being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.400]   with how many different agencies, 60, 70,
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.880]   we've all lost count.
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:27.720]   And you're surrounded by advisors,
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:29.680]   at least a quarter of whom are saying,
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:31.760]   "This is a disaster, we have to close the borders."
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:33.080]   And the others are saying,
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.600]   "No, no, we have to keep the economy going.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:37.120]   "That's what you're running on in November."
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.160]   So being the president in a pandemic
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:40.960]   is a very unenviable position
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:45.440]   because you can't really determine
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:47.240]   whether your public health bureaucracy
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.320]   will get it right or not.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:50.560]   - You don't think to push back on that,
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:53.120]   just like being Churchill in a war is difficult.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.040]   So leaving Trump or Biden aside,
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:58.920]   what I would love to see from a president
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:03.240]   is somebody who makes great speeches
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:06.420]   and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy,
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:08.200]   the public health bureaucracy,
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:09.760]   to get their shit together,
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.600]   to fire certain kinds of people.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:15.160]   I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm a big fan of powerful speeches,
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.380]   especially in the modern age with the internet.
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:19.520]   It can really move people.
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:23.080]   Instead, the lack of speeches
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:28.080]   resulted in certain kinds of forces amplifying division
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.480]   over whether to wear masks or not.
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:35.840]   It's almost like the public picked some random topic
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.640]   over which to divide themselves.
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:39.800]   And there was a complete indecision,
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:41.360]   which is really what it was,
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:45.200]   fear of uncertainty materializing itself
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.440]   in some kind of division.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:48.960]   And then you almost busied yourself
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:50.960]   with the red versus blue politics
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.480]   as opposed to some, I don't know,
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:55.900]   FDR type character just stands and say,
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.840]   "Fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing.
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.660]   We're going to manufacture 5 billion tests.
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.280]   This is what America is great at.
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:07.520]   We're going to build the greatest testing infrastructure
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:10.460]   ever built or something,
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:12.440]   or even with the vaccine development."
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.240]   - But that was what I was about to interject.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:18.380]   In a pandemic, the most important thing is the vaccine.
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:19.520]   If you get that right,
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:21.560]   then you should be forgiven for much else.
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:22.400]   And that was the one thing
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:23.840]   the Trump administration got right,
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:27.480]   because they went around the bureaucracy
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:28.840]   with Operation Warp Speed
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:32.240]   and achieved a really major success.
[02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:38.260]   So I think the paradox of the 2020 story
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:42.180]   in the United States is that the one thing
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:45.680]   that mattered most, the Trump administration got right.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:49.080]   And it got so much else wrong that was sort of marginal
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:50.980]   that we were left with the impression
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.920]   that Trump had been to blame for the whole disaster,
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:56.360]   which wasn't really quite right.
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:57.480]   Sure, it would have been great
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:00.000]   if we'd had Operation Warp Speed for testing,
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.920]   but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests.
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.960]   And this brings me to the question
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:09.360]   that you raised there of polarization
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.740]   and why that happened.
[02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:13.960]   Now, in a book called "The Square and the Tower,"
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:17.140]   I argued that it would be very costly for the United States
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:20.720]   to allow the public sphere to continue to be dominated
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.440]   by a handful of big tech companies,
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:25.260]   that this ultimately would have more adverse effects
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:27.400]   than simply contested elections.
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:31.280]   And I think we saw over the past 18 months
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:32.800]   just how bad this could be,
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:37.720]   because the odd thing about this country
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:40.960]   is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:44.920]   efficacy and about 20% of people refused to get them
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.920]   and still do refuse for reasons that seem best explained
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:54.200]   in terms of the anti-vax network,
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.920]   which has been embedded on the internet for a long time,
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:58.620]   predating the pandemic.
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:02.480]   René Dureste wrote about this pre-2020.
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:04.720]   And this anti-vax network has turned out
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:06.960]   to kill maybe 200,000 Americans
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:08.200]   who could have been vaccinated,
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.080]   but were persuaded through magical thinking
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:14.000]   that the vaccine was riskier than the virus.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000]   Whereas you don't need to be an epidemiologist,
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.400]   you don't need to be a medical scientist
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:21.220]   to know that the virus is about two orders of magnitude
[02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:22.760]   riskier than the vaccine.
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:28.880]   So again, leadership could definitely have been better,
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.520]   but the politicization of everything
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:35.440]   was not Trump's doing alone.
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:39.760]   It happened because our public sphere has been dominated
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.920]   by a handful of platforms whose business model
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.040]   inherently promotes polarization,
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:49.080]   inherently promotes fake news and extreme views,
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:51.400]   because those are the things that get the eyeballs
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.180]   on the screens and sell the ads.
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:55.120]   I mean, this is now a commonplace,
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:58.160]   but when one thinks about the cost of allowing
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:01.840]   this kind of thing to happen,
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.120]   it's now a very high human cost.
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:06.960]   And we were foolish to leave uncorrected
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:09.280]   these structural problems in the public sphere
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.800]   that were already very clearly visible in 2016.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:14.040]   - And you described that,
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:17.440]   like you mentioned that there's these networks
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.880]   that are almost like laying dormant,
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:22.820]   waiting for their time in the sun.
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:25.360]   And they stepped forward in this case.
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:27.840]   And that those network effects just,
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.680]   the service catalyst for whatever
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:34.440]   the bad parts of human nature.
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.360]   I do hope that there's kinds of networks
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:38.720]   that emphasize the better angels of our nature
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:40.800]   to quote Steven Pinker.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:43.520]   - It's just clearly, and we know this
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.360]   from all the revelations of the Facebook whistleblower,
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:49.760]   there is clearly a very clear tension
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:54.120]   between the business model of a company like Facebook
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:56.360]   and the public good.
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:57.680]   And they know that.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.280]   - I just talked to the founder of Instagram.
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:03.840]   Yes, that's the case, but it's not
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:06.000]   from a technology perspective,
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.520]   like absolutely true of any kind of social network.
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:09.840]   I think it's possible to build,
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.080]   actually I think it's not just possible.
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:15.000]   I think it's pretty easy if you set that as the goal
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.840]   to build social networks
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:20.680]   that don't have these negative effects.
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:21.560]   - Right.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:26.120]   But if the business model is we sell ads
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.200]   and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement,
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:31.680]   then the algorithm is biased
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:33.320]   in favor of fake news and extreme views.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:34.800]   - But it's not, so it's not the ads.
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:36.560]   A lot of people blame the ads.
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:40.360]   The problem I think is the engagement
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:42.040]   and the engagement is just the easiest,
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:43.880]   the dumbest way to sell the ads.
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:46.120]   I think there's much different metrics
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:48.760]   that could be used to make a lot more money
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:51.000]   than the engagement in the longterm.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.440]   It has more to do with planning for the longterm.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.560]   So optimizing the selling of ads
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:02.560]   to make people happy with themselves in the longterm
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:07.360]   as opposed to some kind of addicted like dopamine feeling.
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:09.960]   And so that's, to me, that has to do with metrics
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:11.320]   and measuring things correctly
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:13.520]   and sort of also creating a culture
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:16.760]   with what's valued to have difficult conversations
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:18.400]   about what we're doing with society,
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:19.560]   all those kinds of things.
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:21.960]   And I think once you have those conversations,
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:23.800]   this takes us back to the University of Austin,
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:27.080]   kind of once you have those difficult human conversations,
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:30.000]   you can design the technology that will actually make
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.240]   for help people grow, become the best version of themselves,
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:36.000]   help them be happy in the longterm.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.840]   What gives you hope about the future?
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:44.520]   As somebody who studied some of the darker moments
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:46.960]   of human history, what gives you hope?
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:50.240]   A couple of things.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:56.520]   First of all, the United States
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:58.880]   has a very unique operating system,
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:02.160]   which was very well designed by the founders
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:03.600]   who'd thought a lot about history
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:07.840]   and realized it would take quite a novel design
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:10.880]   to prevent the republic going the way of all republics
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.920]   'cause republics tend to end up as tyrannies
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.960]   for reasons that were well-established
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.920]   by the time of the Renaissance.
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:20.680]   And it gives me hope that this design has worked very well
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:25.560]   and withstood an enormous stress test in the last year.
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.560]   I became an American in 2018.
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:32.880]   I think one of the most important features
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.640]   of this operating system is that it is the magnet for talent.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:43.840]   Here we sit, part of the immigration story
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:50.040]   in a darkened room with funny accents.
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:50.880]   - A Scot and a Russian walk into a-
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:54.480]   - A Scot and a Russian walk into a recording studio
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.000]   and talk about America.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]   It's very much like a joke.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.760]   And Elon's a South African and so on,
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:00.760]   and Thiel is a German.
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:03.800]   And we're extraordinarily fortunate
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:06.000]   that the natives let us come and play
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.760]   and play in a way that we could not
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:12.040]   in our countries of birth.
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:14.360]   And as long as the United States continues
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.760]   to exploit that superpower, that it is the talent magnet,
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:20.760]   then it should out-innovate
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.280]   the totalitarian competition every time.
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:29.280]   So that's one reason for being an optimist.
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:33.240]   Another reason, and it's quite a historical reason,
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:34.760]   as you would expect from me.
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:39.040]   Another reason that I'm optimistic
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:44.040]   is that my kids give me a great deal of credit
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:45.080]   and a great deal of hope.
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.720]   They range in age from 27 down to four,
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:52.760]   but each of them in their different way
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.760]   seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:03.800]   without losing contact with that culture
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:08.080]   and civilization that I hold dear.
[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:10.040]   I don't want to live in the metaverse
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:12.680]   as Mark Zuckerberg imagines it.
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:14.960]   To me, that's a kind of ghastly hell.
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:20.920]   I think Western civilization is the best civilization.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:23.920]   And I think that almost all the truths
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:26.480]   about the human condition can be found
[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:32.520]   in Western literature, art, and music.
[02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:37.040]   And I think also that the civilization
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.040]   that produced the scientific revolution
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:42.520]   has produced the great problem-solving
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.720]   tool that eluded the other civilizations
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:47.560]   that never really cracked science.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:52.720]   And what gives me hope is that despite all the temptations
[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:57.440]   and distractions that their generation had to contend with,
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:58.920]   my children in their different ways
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:03.920]   have found their way to literature and to art and to music.
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:08.160]   And they are civilized.
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:14.040]   And I don't claim much of the credit for that.
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:17.880]   I've done my best, but I think it's deeply encouraging
[02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:21.600]   that they found their way to the things
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:25.200]   that I think are indispensable for a happy life,
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:26.560]   a fulfilled life.
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:29.120]   Nobody, I think, can be truly fulfilled
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.120]   if they're cut off from the great body
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:34.120]   of Western literature, for example.
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:38.240]   I've thought a lot about Elon's argument
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.240]   that we might be in a simulation.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:43.200]   No, no, there is a simulation.
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.960]   It's cold literature.
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:49.120]   And we just have to decide whether or not to enter it.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:53.320]   I'm currently in the midst of the later stages
[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:57.320]   of Proust's great "A l'heure recherche du temps perdu."
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:01.480]   And Proust's observation of human relationships
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:05.680]   is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer.
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:08.480]   And it's impossible not to find yourself
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:13.040]   identifying with Marcel and his obsessive,
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:16.040]   jealous relationships, particularly with Albertine.
[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:18.440]   It's the simulation.
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:23.440]   And you decide, I think, as a sentient being,
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:26.920]   how far to, in your own life,
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:30.440]   reenact these more profound experiences
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:31.920]   that others have written down.
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:34.280]   One of my earliest literary simulations
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:37.440]   was to reenact Jack Kerouac's trip in "On the Road"
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:40.640]   when I was 17, culminating in getting very wasted
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:44.800]   in the hanging gardens of Xochimilco, not to be missed.
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:48.680]   And it hit me just as I was reading Proust
[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:50.920]   that that's really how to live a rich life,
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:53.720]   that one lives life, but one lives it
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:56.240]   juxtaposing one's own experience
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:00.400]   against the more refined experiences of the great writers.
[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:02.880]   So it gives me hope that my children do that a bit.
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:04.560]   (laughs)
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:09.360]   - Do you include the Russian authors in the canon?
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:11.760]   - Yes, I don't read Russian,
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:15.720]   but I was entirely obsessed with Russian literature
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:17.160]   as a school boy.
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:20.640]   I read my way through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:24.840]   Turgenev, Chekhov.
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:29.840]   I think of all of those writers,
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.600]   Tolstoy had the biggest impact
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.320]   because at the end of "War and Peace"
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:36.000]   there's this great essay on historical determinism,
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.500]   which I think was the reason I became a historian.
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:44.680]   But I'm really temperamentally a kind of Turgenev person,
[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:48.120]   oddly enough.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:51.040]   I think if you haven't read those novelists,
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:54.160]   I mean, you can't really be a complete human being
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:57.760]   if you haven't read the "Brothers Karamazov."
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:00.960]   You're not really, you're not grown up.
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:02.840]   And so I think in many ways,
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:06.000]   those are the greatest novels.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.440]   Raskolnikov's, remember Raskolnikov's "Nightmare"
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:12.240]   at the end of "Crime and Punishment,"
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:15.320]   in which he imagines in his dream,
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:19.400]   a world in which a terrible virus spreads.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:20.640]   Do you remember this?
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:23.560]   And this virus has the effect of making every individual
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:26.760]   think that what he believes is right.
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:31.960]   And in this self-righteousness,
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.920]   people fall on one another and commit appalling violence.
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:38.360]   That's Raskolnikov's "Nightmare."
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:39.560]   And it's a prophecy.
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.100]   It's a terrible prophecy of Russia's future.
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:47.760]   - Yeah, it's, and coupled with that is probably the,
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:50.840]   I also like the French, the existentialist, all that.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:53.800]   The full spectrum and Germans, Herman Hesse,
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:57.080]   and just that range of human thought
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:58.680]   as expressed in the literature is fascinating.
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:02.460]   I really love your idea that the simulation,
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:09.520]   like one way to live life is to kind of explore
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.920]   these other worlds and borrow from them wisdom
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:17.480]   that you then just map onto your own life.
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:20.120]   So you almost like stitch together your life
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:22.360]   with these kind of pieces from literature.
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.160]   - The highly educated person is constantly struck
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:27.360]   by illusion.
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.400]   Everything is an illusion to something that one has read.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:34.860]   And that is the simulation.
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:38.200]   That's what the real metaverse is.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:42.040]   It's the imaginary world that we enter when we read,
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.780]   empathize, and then recognize in our daily lives
[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:50.080]   some scrap of the shared experience that literature gives us.
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:54.320]   - Yeah, I think of "Aspire to be the Idiot"
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:57.240]   from Prince Mishkin from Dostoevsky,
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:02.240]   and in aspiring to be that, I have become the idiot,
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:04.360]   I feel, at least in part.
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:09.200]   What, you mentioned the human condition,
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.360]   does love have to do?
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:15.040]   What role does it play in the human condition?
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:16.860]   Friendship, love?
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:24.160]   - Love is the drug.
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:31.040]   Love is, this was the great Roxy music line
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:34.000]   that Brian Ferry wrote,
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.520]   and love is the most powerful and dangerous
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:39.820]   of all the drugs.
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:46.160]   The driving force that overrides our reason,
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:54.800]   and of course, it is the primal, it's the primal urge.
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:00.560]   So what a civilized society has to do
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:04.200]   is to prevent that drug, that primal force,
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.160]   from creating mayhem.
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:11.440]   So there have to be rules like monogamy
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:16.280]   and rituals like marriage that reign love in
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:21.280]   and make the addict at least more or less under control.
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:29.400]   And I think that's part of why I'm a romantic
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:35.360]   rather than a Steve Pinker enlightenment rationalist,
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:40.800]   because the romantics realized that love was the drug.
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.680]   It's like the difference in sensibility
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:48.700]   between Handel and Wagner.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:53.000]   And I had a Wagnerian phase when I was an undergraduate.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.740]   I still remember thinking that in,
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:28:02.800]   as old as Liebestod, that Wagner had got the closest to sex
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:07.800]   that anybody had ever got in music, or perhaps to love.
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:12.160]   I'm lucky that I love my wife
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:17.160]   and that we were, by the time we met,
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:23.360]   smart enough to understand that love is a drug
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:28.360]   that you have to kind of take in certain careful ways,
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:34.400]   and that it works best in the context of a stable family.
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:40.520]   That's the key thing, that one has to sort of take the drug
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.360]   and then submit to the conventions
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:47.000]   of marriage and family life.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:55.000]   I think in that respect, I'm a kind of tamed romantic.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.680]   - Tamed romantic.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:57.520]   - That's how I would like to think of myself.
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:01.080]   - And the degree to which your romanticism is tamed
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:03.320]   can be then channeled into productive work.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:05.560]   That's why you are a historian and a writer,
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.040]   is the rest of that love is channeled through the writing.
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:09.760]   - So if you're going to be addicted to anything,
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:11.160]   be addicted to work.
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:13.600]   I mean, we're all addictive,
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:15.680]   but the thing about workaholism
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.880]   is that it is the most productive addiction,
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:22.880]   and rather that than drugs or booze.
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:27.880]   So yes, I'm always trying to channel my anxieties into work.
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.320]   I learned that at a relatively early age,
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:33.640]   it's a sort of massively productive way
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.600]   of coping with the inner demons.
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.360]   And again, we should teach kids that,
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:43.000]   because let's come back to our earlier conversation
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:43.840]   about universities.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.120]   Part of what happens at university
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:49.400]   is that adolescents have to overcome all the inner demons.
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:54.160]   And these include deep insecurity about one's appearance,
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:58.280]   about one's intellect, and then madly raging hormones
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:00.560]   that cause you to behave like a complete fool
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:03.160]   with the people to whom you're sexually attracted.
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:05.560]   All of this is going on in the university.
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:07.120]   How can it be a safe space?
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:09.920]   It's a completely dangerous space by definition.
[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.840]   (laughing)
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:15.560]   So yeah, teaching young people how to manage these storms,
[02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:18.120]   that's part of the job,
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.800]   and we're really not allowed to do that anymore
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.120]   'cause we can't talk about these things
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:24.680]   for fear of the Title IX officers kicking down the door
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:26.880]   and dragging us off in chains.
[02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:28.760]   - And like you said, hard work
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:32.920]   and something you call work ethic in civilization
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:39.360]   is a pretty effective way to achieve, I think,
[02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:42.480]   a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety.
[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:45.200]   - Or at least exhaustion, so that you sleep well.
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:46.720]   (laughing)
[02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:49.320]   - Well, there is beauty to the exhaustion too.
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:52.600]   There's why running, there's manual work,
[02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:55.320]   that some part of us is built for that.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:59.560]   - Right, I mean, we are products of evolution,
[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:03.520]   and our adaptation to a technological world
[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:04.760]   is a very imperfect one.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:09.200]   So hence the kind of masochistic urge to run.
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:14.200]   I'd like outdoor exercise.
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:16.320]   I don't really like gyms.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:21.320]   So I'll go for long punishing runs in woodland,
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.280]   hike up hills.
[02:31:24.280 --> 02:31:27.920]   I like swimming in lakes and in the sea
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:32.720]   because there just has to be that physical activity
[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.680]   in order to do the good mental work.
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:38.880]   And so it's all about trying to do the best work.
[02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:42.480]   That's my sense, that we have
[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:45.760]   some random allocation of talent.
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:47.320]   You kind of figure out what it is
[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:48.960]   that you're relatively good at,
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:51.280]   and you try to do that well.
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:55.160]   I think my father encouraged me to think that way.
[02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:58.560]   And you don't mind about being average at the other stuff.
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:00.760]   The kind of sick thing is to try to be brilliant
[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:02.800]   at everything, I hate those people.
[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:05.000]   You should really not worry too much
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.840]   if you're just an average double bass player,
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:10.120]   which I am, or kind of average skier,
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:12.200]   which I definitely am.
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:15.360]   Doing those things okay is part of leading a rich
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:16.680]   and fulfilling life.
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:19.040]   I was not a good actor,
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:22.800]   but I got a lot out of acting as an undergraduate.
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:25.280]   It turned out after three years of experimentation
[02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:28.240]   at Oxford that I was broadly speaking better
[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:32.920]   at writing history essays than my peers.
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:35.800]   And that was my edge, that was my comparative advantage.
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:37.880]   And so I've just tried to make a living
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:40.280]   from that slight edge.
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:43.680]   - Yeah, that's a beautiful way to describe a life.
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:46.440]   Is there a meaning to this thing?
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:47.920]   Is there a meaning to life?
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:49.880]   What is the meaning of life?
[02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:53.480]   - I was brought up by a physicist and a physician.
[02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:56.560]   They were more or less committed atheists
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:58.360]   who had left the Church of Scotland
[02:32:58.360 --> 02:33:02.240]   as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.
[02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:05.600]   And so my sister and I were told from an early age,
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:07.520]   life was a cosmic accident.
[02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:10.720]   And that was it.
[02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:13.640]   There was no great meaning to it.
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:19.840]   And I can't really get past that.
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:22.800]   - Isn't there a beauty to being an accident
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:24.440]   at a cosmic scale?
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.800]   - Yes, I wasn't taught to feel negative about that.
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:32.360]   And if anything, it was a frivolous insight
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:34.840]   that the whole thing was a kind of joke.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:40.440]   And I think that atheism isn't really a basis
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:45.440]   for ordering a society, but it's been all right for me.
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:51.720]   I don't have a kind of sense of a missing religious faith.
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:58.440]   For me, however, there's clearly some embedded
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:03.800]   Christian ethics in the way my parents lived.
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:08.400]   And so we were kind of atheist Calvinists
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:11.560]   who had kind of deposed God, but carried on behaving
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:14.280]   as if we were members of the elect in a moral universe.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:19.280]   So that's kind of the state of mind that I was left in.
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:26.200]   And I think that we aren't really around long enough
[02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:32.000]   to claim that our individual lives have meaning.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.760]   But what Edmund Burke said is true.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:38.680]   The real social contract is between the generations,
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:41.120]   between the dead, the living and the unborn.
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.720]   And the meaning of life is, for me at least,
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:48.160]   to live in a way that honors the dead,
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.560]   seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom,
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:52.160]   'cause they do still outnumber us.
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.000]   They outnumber the living by quite a significant margin.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.720]   And then to be mindful of the unborn
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:03.560]   and our responsibility to them.
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:07.800]   Writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:10.720]   It may or may not succeed, and probably won't succeed
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:12.160]   if my books are never assigned
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.520]   by woke professors in the future.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.760]   So what we have to do is more than just write books
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:18.320]   and record podcasts.
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:20.560]   There have to be institutions.
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.280]   I'm 57 now.
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:25.200]   I realized recently that succession planning
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:29.000]   had to be the main focus of the next 20 years,
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000]   because there are things that I really care about
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.760]   that I want future generations to have access to.
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:41.080]   And so the meaning of life I do regard
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:44.280]   as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom.
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:50.400]   Ultimately, the species will go extinct at some point.
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:52.240]   Even if we do colonize Mars,
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:55.040]   one senses that physics will catch up
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:56.800]   with this particular organism,
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:59.800]   but it's in the pretty far distant future.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:01.720]   And so the meaning of life is to make sure
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:04.920]   that for as long as there are human beings,
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.920]   they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives,
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:14.280]   ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled,
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.240]   emotionally fulfilled lives,
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:19.040]   that civilization has made possible.
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:24.040]   It would be easy for us to revert to the uncivilized world.
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:29.520]   There's a fantastic book that I'm going to misremember,
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:34.160]   "Milosz's The Captive Mind,"
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:37.120]   which has a fantastic passage.
[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:43.000]   He was a Polish intellectual who says,
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.040]   "Americans can never imagine what it's like
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:49.320]   for civilization to be completely destroyed
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:52.560]   as it was in Poland by the end of World War II,
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:54.280]   to have no rule of law,
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:56.760]   to have no security of even person,
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:58.200]   nevermind property rights.
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:36:59.840]   They can't imagine what that's like
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.560]   and what it will lead you to do."
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:04.560]   So one reason for teaching history
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:09.560]   is to remind the lucky Generation Z members of California
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:15.840]   that civilization's a thin film.
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:18.680]   And it can be destroyed remarkably easily.
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:20.240]   And to preserve civilization
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:23.600]   is a tremendous responsibility that we have.
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:25.880]   It's a huge responsibility.
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:28.320]   And we must not destroy ourselves,
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:31.000]   whether it's in the name of wokeism
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.720]   or the pursuit of the metaverse.
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:36.120]   Preserving civilization and making it available,
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.080]   not just to our kids, but to people we'll never know,
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:41.220]   generations ahead, that's the meaning.
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:47.080]   - And do so by studying the lessons of history.
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:47.920]   - Right.
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:50.560]   Not only studying them, but then acting on them.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:52.120]   For me, the biggest problem is
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:55.140]   how do we apply history more effectively?
[02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:58.440]   It seems as if our institutions, including government,
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.640]   are very, very bad at applying history.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:04.440]   Lessons of history are learned poorly, if at all.
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:06.200]   Analogies are drawn crudely.
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:08.440]   Often the wrong inferences are drawn.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:10.240]   One of the big intellectual challenges for me
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:14.080]   is how to make history more useful.
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:17.000]   And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate,
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.700]   but really practically useful,
[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:21.800]   so that policymakers and citizens
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:23.920]   can think about the decisions that they face
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:28.920]   with a more historically informed body of knowledge.
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:31.720]   Whether it's a pandemic, the challenge of climate change,
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:33.520]   what to do about Taiwan.
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:38.520]   I can't think of a better set of things to know
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:41.040]   before you make decisions about those things
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.400]   than the things that history has to offer.
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.520]   - Well, I love the discipline of applied history.
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:47.560]   Basically going to history and saying,
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:52.000]   "What are the key principles here
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.600]   "that are applicable to the problems of today,
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:55.440]   "and how can we solve them?"
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.280]   - The great philosopher of history, R.G. Collingwood,
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:02.960]   said in his autobiography, which was published in 1939,
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:05.040]   that the purpose of history
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:08.640]   was to reconstitute past thought
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:12.080]   from whatever surviving remnants there were,
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.120]   and then to juxtapose it with our own predicament.
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:18.960]   And that's that juxtaposition of past experience
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:21.360]   with present experience that is so important.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:23.720]   We don't do that well.
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:25.720]   And indeed, we've flipped it
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:28.160]   so that academic historians now think their mission
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:30.440]   is to travel back to the past
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:33.080]   with the value system of 2021,
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:37.200]   and castigate the dead for their racism,
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:40.080]   and sexism, and transphobia, and whatnot.
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:42.120]   And that's exactly wrong.
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:43.920]   Our mission is to go back and try to understand
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:46.560]   what it was like to live in the 18th century,
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:50.720]   not to go back and condescend to the people of the past.
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:52.840]   And once we've had a better understanding,
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:55.280]   once we've seen into their lives, read their words,
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:57.120]   tried to reconstitute their experience,
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:00.380]   to come back and understand our own time better,
[02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:01.960]   that's what we should really be doing.
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:04.160]   But academic history's gone completely haywire,
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:05.760]   and it does almost the exact opposite
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:07.560]   of what I think it should do.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:11.240]   - And by studying history, walk beautifully,
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:14.440]   gracefully through this simulation, as you described,
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:17.800]   by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:20.600]   - We have virtual reality already in our heads.
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:24.480]   We do not need Oculus and the metaverse.
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:27.120]   - This was an incredible, hopeful conversation.
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:29.560]   In many ways that I did not expect,
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:31.920]   I thought our conversation would be much more about history
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:35.120]   than about the future, and it turned out to be the opposite.
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:36.360]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:38.760]   It's a huge honor to finally meet you, to talk to you.
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:40.680]   Thank you for your valuable time.
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:43.520]   - Thank you, Lex, and good luck with Putin.
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:45.240]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:46.540]   with Neil Ferguson.

[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:57.880]   "No civilization, no matter how mighty it may appear
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:01.440]   "to itself, is indestructible."
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:04.380]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
