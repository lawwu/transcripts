[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   When I was in university, there were many topics that I was excited to learn about,
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.680]   some more than others, of course.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.600]   But occasionally I'd be in a class or I'd get an assignment that, frankly, I had minimal
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.680]   interest in, never zero, but minimal interest.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.600]   And as a way of dealing with that, I embarked on a process of literally lying to myself
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   and just telling myself, "Okay, I'm super interested in reading this and I'm going to
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.080]   force myself to be interested in reading it."
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.120]   Lo and behold, I would start falling in love with certain things.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   Maybe it was even the arrival of a word that I didn't recognize.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.840]   And then I would go look it up and I knew I was studying for the GRE at that time, so
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   I filed that away.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.920]   I still have my notebooks of all the vocabulary words that I learned in the course of my university
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.220]   courses that, frankly, made the verbal portion of the GRE pretty easy, which if you ever
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.800]   try and study for that at the end, it's pretty tough to commit all those new words to memory
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   and context.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.920]   So, I could find little hooks and through those hooks, I could kind of ratchet my way
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200]   into a larger interest.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.920]   And then, lo and behold, I'm really interested in Greek mythology, or I actually liked that
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.760]   one at first, but I didn't have to trick myself.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.800]   But maybe we could spend a little bit of time talking about what is true intrinsic motivation?
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.400]   Is it always reflexive?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.880]   Can we make ourselves intrinsically motivated about a given topic or scenario or a group
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.600]   of people?
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.860]   And then let's talk about how intrinsic motivation links to performance, because there's a rich
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.440]   literature on this, as I recall, and I remember, you know, the Stanford study of rewarding
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.720]   kids for things they were already intrinsically motivated to do, maybe we could touch on that
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   a little bit and remind people who haven't heard about it.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.600]   But I'm fascinated by this topic because I feel like so much of life is about doing things
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.000]   that initially we don't feel that excited to do, and yet succeeding in life, you know,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.400]   until you can afford to offload your administrative work to somebody else, which hopefully by
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   now you have.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.280]   To find a way to get it done.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   Right.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.600]   This is fundamental to being a functional human being, frankly.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.360]   Not just successful in air quotes, but functional.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.400]   We got to do stuff that we don't enjoy doing.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   So, I think we can talk about a couple of different ways to nurture intrinsic motivation.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.040]   We can think about how the task itself is designed, we can think about reward systems,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.960]   and then we can think about also the things we say to ourselves and others, which I hope
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.680]   are not lies, but rather persuasive attempts.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   Let's start on that one, actually.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.280]   I don't know a lot of people who are that good at deliberate self-deception.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.920]   Well, I like to think it was only around a particular set of goal-motivated pursuits.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.760]   But at that time for me also it was survival.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.920]   As I mentioned, I didn't do well in high school.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   I really wanted to perform well in university.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.560]   But I knew that working just for the grade wasn't going to carry me.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   It felt catabolic.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.980]   And I don't know, maybe at that age I was still in the window of heightened neuroplasticity.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.800]   We know it never closes.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   But I think I also fell in love with the process of learning how to do what I just described.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.120]   So, I think for most people the best method of self-persuasion is actually to convince
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120]   somebody else.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   So, I'm thinking of Eliot Aronson's classic research on cognitive dissonance, where he
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.220]   would ask you to go and tell somebody else a task you hated is really interesting.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.520]   And if he paid you a lot to do it, you still hated the task because you had a justification.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.360]   Like, I got 20 bucks to kind of fib a little bit about this task.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.120]   You know, the task is bad, but I did it for the payment.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.720]   When he paid you $1 to go and tell somebody that you loved a task that you didn't, you
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.400]   ended up liking it more.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Wow.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.560]   And maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but maybe you should tell me why I shouldn't be surprised.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.520]   Because I hope people got what you just said very clearly.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   If they didn't – if you don't like doing something, going and reporting to somebody
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.000]   else how great that thing is, so lying about it to somebody else, is one way to increase
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   the degree to which you like or enjoy that behavior or topic.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   And if you're paid $20 to go lie to somebody in the positive direction, so against your
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.440]   true belief, it's less effective in shifting your underlying affect about that thing, your
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.760]   emotions, than if you're paid less.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   Correct?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.080]   Now, I think obviously in the experiment, lying was an easy way to show the effect.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.280]   But in real life, I think the way that you want to apply this is to say, all right, I've
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.680]   got to find something about this task that's interesting to me.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.440]   And then in the process of explaining it to somebody else, I'm going to convince myself
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.640]   because I'm hearing the argument from somebody I already like and trust.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.800]   I've also chosen – I've chosen the reasons that I find compelling as opposed to hearing
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.680]   somebody else's reasons.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.800]   And so I think this goes to the point that you were making, which is if you're trying
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.520]   to find a hook to make a topic intriguing, you've got to figure out, okay, what is it
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.080]   that would make this fascinating to me?
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.520]   And in a lot of cases, what you're looking for is a curiosity gap.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.920]   I think social scientists like to talk about curiosity as an itch that you have to scratch.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   So there's something you want to know, and you don't know it yet.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   So I would say – I tell my students often, like, take your least favorite class and find
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.520]   a mystery or a puzzle, like, something that you just do not know the answer to.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.480]   Like, I actually have talked with our kids about this, like, what really happened to
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   King Tut?
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   Do you know?
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.280]   Can you get to the bottom of that?
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   And all of a sudden, you're like, "I wonder.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.080]   I need to Google it, and then I need to see if Wikipedia has credible information on this."
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   And the more you learn about that, the more intriguing it becomes.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.400]   And I think that's the beginning of the process of finding intrinsic motivation.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   Aaron Powell I see.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.760]   So inherent in your answer is the idea that there's something wired into our neural circuits
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:06.800]   and therefore psychology that curiosity as a verb, the act of being curious and seeking
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.720]   information where – well, and I should say, I define curiosity – and hopefully, you'll
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.320]   disagree with me or agree either way.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.880]   It doesn't matter as long as we can get a bit deeper understanding.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.400]   I define curiosity as a desire to find something out where you are not attached to a particular
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   outcome.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   Yes.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   Is that right?
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.760]   In psychology, it's typically defined as just wanting to know.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.200]   And that means you're driven by the question, not a particular answer, which is exactly
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   what you're driving at.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   Aaron Powell Okay, great.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.320]   And I think it was Dorothy Parker that said, "The cure for boredom is curiosity.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.760]   There is no cure for curiosity."
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.320]   Kevin Vallier As there shouldn't be a cure for curiosity.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   Aaron Powell Right.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.680]   So – and by the way, folks, we don't know what neural circuits subserve curiosity in
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   the brain.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680]   It's got to be a distributed network.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.160]   There's no brain area for curiosity, but it's got to be linked up with the reward
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.120]   systems of dopamine, et cetera, in some way because when one discovers something new that
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.880]   satisfies some curiosity, it's clearly there's an internal reward there.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.040]   Okay, let me back up.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   So if your child or an adult is dreading working, exploring a topic or going about an assignment
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.080]   of any kind, you will give them a question that they then need to resolve.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.280]   What if the assignment is like rake the leaves off the front lawn?
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.400]   Do you say, you know, count the leaves or – I mean, how does one get past the sort
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.040]   of procrastination and generate some intrinsic motivation for things that one dreads where
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.780]   it's unlikely that they're going to discover some knowledge that's exceedingly useful
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.780]   for the – for future?
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.780]   Kevin Vallier You always start with, okay, what's the first
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.940]   experiment I can run?
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.000]   Find the most interesting looking leaf or your favorite leaf, and then that lasts for
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   about two minutes.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And okay, now what?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   We still have a lot of leaves there.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Aaron Powell Right.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.400]   So I think not all tasks can be made intrinsically motivating to everyone.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.840]   And so when intrinsic motivation is difficult to find, what you want to substitute with
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.560]   is a sense of purpose.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.640]   Maybe a better way to say that is when the process is not interesting to you, you need
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   to find a meaningful outcome.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:17.320]   So there's some research on the boring but important effect where kids who have a purpose
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.660]   for learning – this goes through high school – and think, you know, this is not just
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.000]   interesting to me, but I'm going to be able to use this knowledge to help other people
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   one day.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.840]   They're more persistent in their studying, they end up getting better grades.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.760]   And so I think intrinsic motivation is often driven by curiosity about the how.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.640]   A sense of purpose comes from really thinking hard about the why.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.040]   Why does this matter?
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.720]   And so I'd say with the raking leaves, let's try to connect that task to something else
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.360]   that you care about.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.080]   Are you going to pleasantly surprise your parents when they get home?
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.240]   Are you going to have a place to play soccer that you didn't before?
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.000]   And I think then the process of getting to that – I guess what I'd say is if you're
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.400]   trying to motivate yourself, it's a little bit harder than if you're trying to motivate
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   somebody else on this.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.880]   If I was going to motivate somebody else, I would take a page out of the motivational
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.240]   interviewing playbook where I would say, okay, Andrew, actually, let's play this out for
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   a second.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   So you're going to rake a pile of leaves.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240]   It's a two-hour task.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.180]   Zero to ten, how excited are you about that?
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.180]   A three.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.180]   Three?
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.180]   Really?
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.180]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.180]   I'm surprised.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.180]   I thought you were going to say zero or one.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.180]   Mm-hmm.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.180]   Why is it not lower?
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.520]   I like any sort of physical activity because it allows me to move and I just like moving
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   my body.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   There we go.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   Okay.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.360]   So you just identified a potential source of purpose for that activity.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.840]   And I don't have a vested interest in convincing you to do this task.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.480]   I am genuinely curious about what would motivate you to want to do it.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.120]   And as you start to articulate it, boom, self-persuasion kicks in.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   Love it.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.720]   I'm going to start using these approaches.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.960]   Try it at your own risk.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.920]   I have a question about extrinsic motivation.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:12.720]   So if we grow up being incentivized by extrinsic things, you know, you'll get your allowance
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.700]   if you blank.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.840]   You can spend the money that you make on your paper route doing the things you really want
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   to do.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:29.020]   Is there any value in those kinds of learning-based incentives for kids and for adults?
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.960]   Because I mean, that's the real world as well.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   I know plenty of people.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.560]   I have family members that only work for a paycheck and they're pretty okay because they
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.080]   like spending their paycheck.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.960]   I mean, I'm not intrinsically attached to money.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.160]   I mean, I certainly have needs in life, but I don't enjoy spending money for the sake
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.920]   of spending it or for gaining more possessions.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.420]   But I know people that do, and I certainly don't judge.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:59.760]   Are they somehow existing in a diminished landscape of happiness?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.900]   Because they seem pretty happy to me.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.000]   But they seem to have also worked out this relationship.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.320]   They do certain things to get the extrinsic rewards, and they really enjoy what they can
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.400]   do with those extrinsic rewards.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.760]   So there's a huge body of evidence on what are the effects of extrinsic rewards on motivation
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.360]   and performance.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.420]   And I think the latest conclusions, if you look at the latest meta-analyses, so a huge
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.200]   study of studies trying to accumulate what's the average effect of adding a financial incentive
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.360]   to a task that wasn't incentivized before or to a job where you were paid salary and
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.320]   now we're going to give you incentive compensation.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   There is a boost.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:43.640]   So in general, people are more productive when they're incentivized for their output.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.000]   But these incentives are better for motivating quantity than quality.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.360]   So you see people get more done, but they're not necessarily more careful or more thorough.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.880]   Are they less careful and less thorough?
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   No.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.640]   Actually, there's still positive effects on average.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   They're just weaker.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.760]   And of course, you could then start to say, well, how do I incentivize being fast and
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.360]   careful?
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.440]   But I think where we do have to be really cautious is there's an undermining effect
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.280]   And you were alluding to this earlier, dating back to the early '70s, where we know that
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.160]   if we take an interesting task and then we pay you for it, you might conclude that you're
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.800]   only doing it for the outcome and you lose interest in the task.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.880]   So the classic demonstration, Mark Lepper and colleagues, is kids playing video games.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.360]   And they're playing them because they're fun.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.520]   And then you start to add in an incentive.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.080]   And then when the incentive's taken away, they don't want to play anymore because the
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.680]   meaning of the task has changed.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.160]   And now I'm doing it because I want to get something out of it, as opposed to I love
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.880]   the process.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.000]   I think that that phenomenon does not have to exist.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.520]   So we know, for example, at work, if managers, as long as they give people autonomy, they
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.440]   don't present the rewards in a controlling way.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.160]   So instead of saying, Andrew, in order to earn this, you need to do the following work.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.760]   If they say, hey, look, I'd really love it if you would deliver the following.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.700]   And in order to make that worth your while, I'm offering this incentive.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.800]   People react very differently when they have a sense of choice and control.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.440]   So I think that that's, I guess, the starting point.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.640]   In the presence of autonomy, I don't think there's a major downside of extrinsic rewards.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.840]   I think you also have to be careful that, yeah, I guess that you're not over-justifying
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   the task.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.240]   In other words, you're not swamping people's intrinsic reason for doing it, but you're
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.520]   adding a reason to try it.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.880]   So actually, if we go to a different domain for a second.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.980]   So look at kids who don't want to eat their vegetables.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.920]   Extrinsic incentives are very effective to get kids to try vegetables for the first time.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.080]   But then the hope is that they discover a vegetable or two that they don't mind, and
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.320]   then they find reasons to keep doing it.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   And I think that that's how I want a lot of rewards to work.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.440]   I don't think that rewards should be carrots that we dangle to try to control people's
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   behavior.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.560]   I think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate and value a particular behavior.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.320]   If you frame them that way, it's a lot easier for people to say, "Yeah, you know what?
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.920]   That reward is something that I really want, but I'm not only doing the task for that reward."
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.760]   You basically answered the question I was going to ask, which is, and at risk of sounding
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:35.120]   new agey, but we are sitting in California, I could imagine that when one is focused on
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.800]   the extrinsic rewards, so a physical task or a cognitive task for an extrinsic reward,
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   if I'm focusing on the extrinsic reward, I'm also, air quotes again, "not present," right?
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.680]   I'm thinking about the outcome.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.040]   I'm not thinking about process.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.360]   And I think there's, and perhaps you can flesh out some of what this is exactly, but I think
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:02.520]   there's a fairly extensive data to support the idea that when we are physically and mentally
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.760]   present to the task, that we're going to perform better.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:11.000]   And presumably our intrinsic liking of that task or performing that task increases as
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   well.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Is that true?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.760]   I think, so if we want to break down the mechanisms for why intrinsic motivation is useful for
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.460]   performance, one you touched on earlier, it's focus of attention.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.760]   It's much easier to find flow when you're intrinsically motivated.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.560]   You get into that state of deep absorption where time melts away.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.540]   So you mentioned sort of either speeding up or slowing down your sense of time.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.540]   You forget where you are.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.440]   Sometimes you even lose track of your identity and you're just merged into the task.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.320]   And so that concentration is helpful.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.200]   There's also a greater persistence effect that when you enjoy what you're doing, you're
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.720]   less likely to give up in the face of obstacles.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.760]   You're more likely to think about it when you're not doing the task and come up with
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   great ideas.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.840]   And so, you know, I think there's a working harder, there's a working longer, there's
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.160]   a working smarter, and there's also a thinking more clearly effect.
