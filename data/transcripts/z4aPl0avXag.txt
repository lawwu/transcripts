[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   Having you know been undercover as someone who's purchasing that
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:13.080]   It's just so sad. Like it was funny like I would just sit in a room and talk to him
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.960]   like, you know, it's like about $300 for an hour or whatever and
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.200]   They wanted to do everything but have sex and if they thought they could get away with just talking to you for an hour
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.240]   They would just be like this is you know, so money so that you had to talk to the children
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.100]   Yeah, the girls like as an undercover. Yeah, but so a lot of times when you
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.760]   You know identify yourself as police all those kind of things then they clam up
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.660]   Yeah, but if you're a John and you're just sitting there and you're asking them about their life
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.360]   Then they're just they're willing to tell you anything to not have to perform a sex act
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.380]   So they'll sit there and talk to you. So it's a completely consensual conversation. So it's it's there's no
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.980]   Yeah, rights violations or anything like that. So I would try to get as much if we're gonna meet with you know girls that night
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.860]   Why don't I sit in the room with them and talk to him for 30 or 45 minutes and see how much information I can gain
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.980]   from them
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.820]   before the police come in and they arrest the pimp outside all those kind of things because she might be more willing to tell
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.860]   me a lot of information or if not
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.260]   I can get a lot of information the thing when she's interviewed by a
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.340]   Forensic specialist then they're gonna be able to use a lot of that information have a lot more knowledge when they
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.140]   They try to engage with her and get her services. So as an undercover agent, why can't you?
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.780]   You know meet with these children that you is this talking to him in person or is it online?
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.620]   In person, so like why can't you just walk into a room and see that this guy has these children and on the spot?
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.860]   So they do it all it's like all alcohol
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.620]   So I will either set up a house or a hotel room and those kind of things
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.580]   the
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.020]   Child will come to the front door
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.780]   There's a car sitting, you know three blocks away
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.380]   You got a surveillance team watching that bring the kid in and then you have to make sure that they're there to you know
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.980]   Perform a sex act like you certified crew, right?
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.540]   So you're just making all those steps and so my thought when doing that was like why not get as much information while I can
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.340]   Because the the car is sitting there outside like nothing's gonna happen. So dang that is
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.420]   Crazy to me. I had a 16 year old girl with a pistol in her pocket
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.260]   I was pretty sure she was gonna try to rob me. So I had that really yeah
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.600]   Dude, that is a crazy job to work in like that is do you have a lot of trauma like now about that?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.180]   or it just like not I I
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.700]   Don't have a lot of trauma about it
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.060]   I know a lot of people who have done what I do have a lot of trauma. Mm-hmm
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.540]   I feel fortunate. I feel like I have a
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.820]   Great family. I have a great friends that
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.140]   Understand what I go to people like you, you know, I mean like if there was no guys
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.780]   Are you willing to put themselves in these situations?
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.740]   You know
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.060]   We wouldn't rescue these kids in the first place
