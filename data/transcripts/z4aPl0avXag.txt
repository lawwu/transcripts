[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.640]   having you know been undercover as someone who's purchasing that um it's just so sad like it was
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   funny like i would just sit in a room and talk to him like you know it's like 300 for an hour or
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.880]   whatever and they wanted to do everything but have sex and if they thought they could get away with
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.320]   just talking to you for an hour they would just be like this is you know easy money so that you had
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.000]   to talk to the children yeah the girls like as an undercover yeah but so a lot of times when you
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.840]   um you know identify yourself as police all those kind of things then they clam up yeah but if you're
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.000]   a john and you're just sitting there and you're asking them about their life then they're just
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.680]   they're willing to tell you anything to not have to perform a sex act so they'll sit there and talk
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.200]   to you so uh it's a completely consensual conversation so it's it's there's no yeah
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.240]   rights violations or anything like that so i would try to get as much if we're gonna meet with you know
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   girls that night why don't i sit in the room with them and talk to them for 30 or 45 minutes and see
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.000]   how much information i can gain from them before the police come in and they arrest the pimp outside
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   all those kind of things because she might be more willing to tell me a lot of information or if not i can
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.400]   get a lot of information that then when she's interviewed by a forensic specialist then they're
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.800]   going to be able to use a lot of that information have a lot more knowledge when they they try to
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.000]   engage with her and get her services so as an undercover agent why can't you you know meet with
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.920]   these children that you is is this talking to them in person or is it online uh in person so like why
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.520]   can't you just walk into a room and see that this guy has these children and on the spot so they do
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   it all it's like all alcohol so uh we'll either set up a house or a hotel room and those kind of things
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:02.160]   uh the child will come to the front door uh there's a car sitting you know three blocks away you got a
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.040]   surveillance team watching that bring the kid in and then you have to make sure that they're there to
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.800]   you know perform sex you have to like get certified proof right so you're just making all those steps
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.600]   and so my thought when doing that was like why not get as much information while i can because the the
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   car is sitting there outside like nothing's going to happen so dang that is crazy to me i had a 16 year
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.000]   old girl with a pistol in her pocket i was pretty sure she was gonna try to rob me so i had to really
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.880]   yeah dude that is a crazy job to work in like that is do you have a lot of trauma like now about that or
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:49.200]   it just like not i i don't have a lot of trauma about it um i know a lot of people who have done what i
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   do have a lot of trauma um i feel fortunate i feel like i have a great family i have a great friends
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.600]   that understand what i go through people like you you know i mean like if there was no guys like you
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.120]   willing to put themselves in these situations you know um we wouldn't rescue these kids in the first place
