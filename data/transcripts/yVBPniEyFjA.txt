[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   Well, we seem to be hardwired to root our happiness
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.720]   in our circumstances.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.320]   It just comes naturally to us.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.860]   We are the happiest when things are going well.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.860]   We are the saddest when things are going badly.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.440]   Our mood is determined by the up and down roller coaster
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.400]   of life's ever-changing circumstances.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.800]   We do it at age four, we do it at age 24,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.520]   we do it at age 44, and we do it at age 14.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.740]   Today I want you to meet Tessa.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.280]   She's a 14-year-old listener to the podcast
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.760]   who writes into us.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.140]   Tessa writes this, "Dear Pastor Jon, hello.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.520]   "Thank you so much for this podcast
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.960]   "and for the Ministry of Desiring God.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.480]   "All of it has been a huge blessing in my life.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.700]   "Recently, I have been feeling more and more
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.480]   "that my happiness depends on the circumstances around me.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.700]   "Will you please offer me biblical guidance
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.360]   "on how I can root my joy in Jesus instead?"
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.360]   - Well, I feel so thankful for this from a 14-year-old.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.180]   My, my, my.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.400]   When I think back on the things that I struggled with
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   when I was 14, I don't think I posed the question
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.480]   the way I should have.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.940]   So let me just encourage you that your very way
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.880]   of asking this question is a sign of significant,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.880]   growing spiritual life and maturity for your age especially.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.760]   So take heart.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   From where I sit, it looks to me like God is at work
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.240]   in your life, and that is always a wonderful miracle.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280]   Before I give you some suggestions from the Bible
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.280]   for how you can shift your circumstance-dependent happiness
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.040]   onto Jesus-dependent happiness, let me also say
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.840]   that this battle that you feel right now,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   you will be fighting 60 years from now
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.200]   if you're still alive and Jesus hasn't come back
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.560]   because that's how old I am.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.280]   Actually, I'm one year older than that.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.040]   75, not 74.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.840]   And I have to address this issue
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   of where my joy is rooted every day,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.720]   every morning in battle against the devil
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.700]   and the world and the flesh,
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.040]   rather than letting the old nature
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.920]   that the Bible calls the flesh lure me away from Jesus
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.400]   to earthly things as more valuable.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.080]   Every stage in life, a 14-year-old stage
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   and a 75-year-old stage has its unique allurements away
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.320]   from Jesus-dependent happiness
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.680]   to world-dependent happiness.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.480]   It does, so you're going to have to fight this
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.840]   all the way to the end, so it's good to get a good start now
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.400]   and learn your battle strategy.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840]   So let me make four suggestions for how to root your joy
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160]   in Jesus and not in circumstances.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.320]   Number one, get to know God's purpose
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.280]   for the troubles in your life.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.640]   God is much more committed to building godly joy,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.400]   happiness into his children
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.240]   than we are committed to finding it.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   And one of his ways of doing this is by seeing to it
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.200]   that we walk through enough trouble
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.840]   to make us give up on finding our joy
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.240]   in a trouble-free life.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.200]   Get to know the passages in the Bible that teach this.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   For example, Romans 5:3, "We rejoice in our sufferings,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640]   knowing that suffering produces endurance,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.320]   and endurance produces character,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.160]   and character produces hope,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.600]   and hope does not put us to shame
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.880]   because God's love has been poured into our hearts
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.360]   through the Holy Spirit who's been given to us."
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.880]   In other words, the joy of hope is intensified
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.640]   when our faith endures through trouble.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.000]   Or 2 Corinthians 1:8, Paul says,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.040]   "We were so utterly burdened beyond our strength
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.360]   that we despaired of life itself,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   but that was to make us,"
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.000]   this was God's purpose, in other words,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.960]   "that was to make us rely not on ourselves,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.760]   but on God who raises the dead."
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   In other words, the joy of complete reliance upon Jesus
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.200]   is God's purpose when he brings us
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.380]   to the very brink of death.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.980]   So, suggestion number one,
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.100]   get to know this biblical teaching
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.180]   for the rest of your life.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180]   It will serve you very well.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.300]   Number two, it's a little unusual.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.660]   Think it through with me.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.660]   I suggest that you take all the natural pleasures
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.920]   that God gives you, which are not sinful,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   and make the conscious effort to see and to savor,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   or taste, God himself in and behind those pleasures.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.540]   In other words, the best way to keep a God-given pleasure
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.540]   from becoming your God is to push into the pleasure
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.320]   and through the pleasure to the giver of the pleasure
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.540]   who is trying to show you something about himself
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.880]   and how satisfying he is.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.780]   So, for example, the Bible says that God's word
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.880]   is sweeter than honey.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.180]   And the Bible says that Jesus is the light of the world.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.300]   And the Bible says that he's like living water.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.980]   So, when you taste anything that is really delicious,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.180]   or when you pass out of a scary darkness
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.820]   into some beautiful light and brightness,
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.740]   or when you really, really, really are thirsty
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.620]   and you drink a glass of cold water,
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.700]   at every one of those points, say to yourself
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.620]   that Jesus is sweeter than honey,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.840]   and he wants me to taste him in the gift of honey.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.020]   Say to yourself that Jesus is brighter
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.820]   than this beautiful light,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.380]   and he wants me to enjoy him in his brightness.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.560]   And say to yourself that Jesus is more satisfying
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.340]   than this great thirst-quenching water,
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.320]   and he wants me to be satisfied in him
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.660]   like I feel right now with this water, only better.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660]   In other words, form the habit of finding God everywhere
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.340]   that there is goodness in this world.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.160]   This will keep you from treating the goodness as God,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.200]   and it will keep you from scorning the goodness of God
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.100]   by rejecting the gifts.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.100]   All God's good gifts are meant not for idolatry.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.400]   They are meant to give us a taste
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   of the one who created them and show us something of himself.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.900]   And I find it helpful to add this.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.340]   Since I'm a sinner and deserve nothing
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.380]   from God but judgment, therefore,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.380]   every good thing that comes to me as a child of God
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.160]   was purchased for me by the blood of Jesus,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.860]   without which I would only be condemned.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.980]   I would base all that on Romans 8:32.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.360]   Therefore, every good thing not only points me
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.340]   to the goodness of the giver,
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.080]   but it points me to the infinite price
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.880]   that was paid by Jesus so that I could have the gift.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.740]   And the giver, this helps me love him as I ought.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.020]   I hope it does you too.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.580]   Number three, make your Bible reading every day
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.980]   very personal.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.420]   Don't just think about learning how to live
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.820]   from guidelines in the Bible, which are important,
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.820]   but every day, think about what you can know of Jesus,
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.980]   the son of God, and God the Father,
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.700]   and God the Holy Spirit,
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.180]   what you can know about them as persons.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.380]   In other words, read the Bible
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.000]   to get to know the person of God.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.840]   Always think, I love a person.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.420]   I love a person.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.840]   God is admirable.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.120]   God is strong.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   God is wise.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.600]   God is kind.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.820]   God is patient.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.660]   God is just.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.400]   God is merciful.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.360]   And as you see these traits in God,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.340]   love him because of them.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.260]   Find the person himself to be your treasure.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.380]   Make Bible reading personal.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.380]   And finally, number four, even though you're only 14,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.760]   keep death regularly in your mind.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.380]   Not all the time, just regularly return to the thought
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.780]   that you're gonna die.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.100]   And the point of this is not to make you scared.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.300]   It's not to make you sad.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.120]   It's not to make you morose, just the opposite.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.160]   Everybody is going to die unless Jesus comes back first.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.640]   Might happen when you're 15,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.140]   might happen when you're 95, but it is gonna happen.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.960]   And when that time comes,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   everything but Jesus will lose its comforting power.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.240]   All our possessions, all our accomplishments,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.580]   all our personal looks and intellect,
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.740]   all our family and friends,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.880]   all of them will fail as a foundation for hope
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.700]   and joy in our dying.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.540]   But if you know Jesus personally,
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.540]   the day of your death will not be a day
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.720]   of just leaving things behind that you're familiar with,
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.840]   but it will be a day of stepping into the presence
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.020]   of the one that we care about most.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.020]   So thank you for asking such a very good question at age 14.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.460]   I'm really excited about what God is gonna do in your life
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.920]   between now and when you're 24.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.760]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.140]   Tessa, thank you for the question at age 14.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.180]   And Pastor John, thank you for these insights from age 75.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.020]   Very helpful.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.200]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.260]   You can ask a question of your own
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.860]   and search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.900]   You can do all that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.140]   Well, speaking of circumstances,
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.340]   we're going to pick up on this theme next time
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.740]   and look at the story in John 11 about Lazarus
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.400]   and look at the circumstances around his life and his death.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.060]   This story will jolt your brain and heart in a good way
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.240]   as we try to understand what does it mean to know
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.060]   that God loves me?
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.140]   John 11 is where we will be next time.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.900]   Feel free to read it ahead of time, the whole chapter.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.780]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.340]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.180]   See you then.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:31.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
