[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 2, verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Verses 12 and 13 in the second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, "What meaneth this?"
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Others, mocking, said, "These men are full of new wine."
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Now, we've been considering together on the last Sunday mornings this great phenomenon
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   that has been seen in the Christian church from time to time throughout the centuries,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and to which we give the name of revival, or a spiritual awakening, or a visitation of the Spirit of God.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We've looked at it as we see it described in the Scriptures.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We've looked at its character in general.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   We've looked at its object and its purpose.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And we have seen clearly that this is a great and a striking phenomenon
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   which is designed to revive the church, and secondarily, to call the attention of the world that is outside
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   that men and women may be led and brought to salvation.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It is a kind of sign that God gives in this way, in order to confirm his work in the church
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and establish his people, and build them up and encourage them,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and at the same time, as I say, it overflows in mighty blessing to those who are without.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Now then, having described it in that way, and having seen its leading features and characteristics,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   and especially having considered last Sunday morning what is its object and its purpose,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   it seems to me that the next logical step is this, is to ask this question.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   What effect then does it have, and especially upon those who are without?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It is meant to let all the nations of the world know that the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as we saw it there in the book of Joshua.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But the question arises at once, does it have that effect?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Are all convinced by it?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And it is in order that we may consider that question, I call your attention to this famous and well-known section
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Here an answer is given to that question, which is of very great value to us,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and should be of urgent concern to all who are looking for and longing for revival.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Here at Inuit is a possible reaction, and we find it not only here but elsewhere in the Bible,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and as you read the history of the Church and of revivals throughout the centuries,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   you find that this kind of thing is constantly repeated.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Here is one effect at Inuit.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   They were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, "What meaneth this? What is this?"
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You remember the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the disciples and others with them there in the upper room,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   upon the hundred and twenty, and as the result of this mighty outpouring of the Spirit that came upon them,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   they began to speak in other tongues, and undoubtedly there were many other similar phenomena as well.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And this was noised abroad, and the people gathered together from everywhere, and observing and hearing this,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   they said, "What meaneth this? What is this?"
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   They were amazed, some doubted, and these said, "What meaneth this?"
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Others, mocking, said, "These men are full of new wine. They're drunk."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Now there, you see, is a reaction on the part of certain people to this mighty phenomenon
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   which takes place when God pours forth his Spirit.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Now this, I say, is a reaction which is due, as we have told here so plainly in the context,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   to a certain phenomena that may sometimes accompany revivals.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   There is no doubt at all but that it was the phenomena that accompanied the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   that led to this reaction. It was this speaking in tongues and other phenomena, I say.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   That was the thing that attracted and caused people to doubt and to be amazed and some to mock
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and to say that this was just due to the fact that these men were full of new wine.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Well now, in the history of revivals, you will find the same sort of reaction,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   practically without any exception at all.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   There are people who disapprove of the whole notion of revival.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There are people like that in the Christian Church as well as people who are outside the Christian Church.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So it seems to me that it is very important that we should deal with this question of the phenomena.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Now they can be subdivided into various groups.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   First, there are the tendencies, undoubtedly in most revivals, to an emotional element.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I don't think there has ever been a revival but that that has been present.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Some people have been moved very deeply and profoundly and sometimes others in a very excitable manner
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   during a period of revival.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   That is just a sheer fact which I am putting before you.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I am going to deal with possible explanations in a moment but I am simply collecting the facts at the moment.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   But there are other phenomena also.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And it is these others that generally have been the subject of most criticisms.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   When I say phenomena, I mean that things happen over and above the fact that large numbers of people
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   are awakened and large numbers of members of the Church are aroused and are quickened.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I mean over and above the fact that thousands of people are converted, as I have been indicating to you.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Now the phenomena I am talking about are in addition to all that.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And this question of the additional phenomena is a very important and indeed a very fascinating one.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Now let me make this clear.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   These phenomena do not always manifest themselves in a revival.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   You can have a revival without the phenomena at all.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   But it is generally speaking true to say that in most revivals these phenomena do come into the picture.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now take for instance a very interesting fact like this.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Take a hundred years ago.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I have reminded you repeatedly that this revival was experienced in the United States of America,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   in Northern Ireland, in Wales, in Scotland, and partially in other countries.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Now this is an interesting fact.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   These additional phenomena that we are going to consider were very little in evidence in the United States.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They were very little in evidence in Wales.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   They were almost nonexistent in Scotland.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But they were very marked and very striking in Northern Ireland.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Now there is an interesting fact before we go any further.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Establishing the point I have just been making, that these phenomena are not essential to revival.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   They are not invariably present.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   They may be, they may not be.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So we have got to keep that in our minds.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   You can have a revival without these phenomena at all.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And yet it is true to say on the whole that they tend to be present when there is a revival.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Though the extent and so on varies tremendously from district to district and from country to country.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Well now then, what are these phenomena to which I am referring?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It seems to me that the best way to classify them is to put them under two headings.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   First of all, certain physical phenomena.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And the physical phenomena are these.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Under the influence of this mighty power, people may literally fall to the ground under conviction of sin.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Literally fall to the ground and/or faint and remain perhaps for a considerable time in a state of unconsciousness.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Now in the revival in 1859 in Northern Ireland, they referred to this as being struck.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Because it was exactly as if a person had been literally struck or hit upon the head.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And they fell to the ground in a state of complete unconsciousness.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   This has frequently happened in revivals in other places and in different centuries.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Then there are people who seem to go into trances.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   They are obviously in a state of trance.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   They may be seated or they may be standing.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And they are looking into the distance, obviously seeing something.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And yet they are completely unconscious.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   They are not aware of their surroundings.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   They don't seem to be able to see anything nor to hear anything that is round and about them.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   They are evidently seeing something with a spiritual eye which is not visible to others in a state of trance.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's the only word which we can imply with respect to it.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well now there are some of the physical phenomena.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   There are others.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   But there is no purpose in my giving you a full or a detailed list.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   There are a whole group of phenomena which belong thus to the realm of the physical.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And which have often been regarded as purely physical and have even been treated medically as purely physical phenomena.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Now you'll never read the story of a revival without coming across that.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And those of you who have been reading, and I trust you all have, the books on the revival in Northern Ireland a century ago,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   will have come across this because, as I say, it was a very, very prominent feature in that revival.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But then in addition to these physical phenomena, there are also certain mental phenomena.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   What do I mean by mental phenomena?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Well I mean things now which do not so much affect the body as clearly affect the mind.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I am referring to, for instance, things like this.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   A most extraordinary gift of speech is given to people during revival.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You hear of this kind of thing.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   People who, if they did ever take part in prayer at all in the church, were very halting and very hesitant,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   suddenly begin to pray with an amazing eloquence,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   with extraordinary language that they were never capable of before.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   There are many instances of this. I was talking to a man only about two or three weeks ago
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   who well remembered the revival of 1904 and 1905 in Wales,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and he was telling me what happened to his own minister.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   They'd had this man as minister in that church for a number of years.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   He was an able man, always preached what they would call a good and a sound sermon,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   but was always halting and hesitant, coughed a lot.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He was a poor speaker in every respect, I say apart from his matter.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Well this man attended a presbytery meeting one day.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   He'd been to the presbytery on similar occasions many, many times.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   He went to this particular presbytery, and in the presbytery reports were given by numbers of other ministers
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   of the events which had been taking place in their churches during the revival.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   These men listened, and he came back to his own church completely transformed as a preacher.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   He went into his pulpit the next Sunday, and they rarely could scarcely believe he was the same man.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   All the hesitation had gone. All the impediment had disappeared.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   He spoke with freedom, with authority, and with power such as they'd never known from him before.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now that kind of thing, a gift of speech is given in prayer, or in conversation, or in description.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Not only that, there is very often a gift of prophecy given.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I mean by that a literal ability to foretell the future.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Now we must face these things, because it does seem to me that we are in grave danger
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   of our learning and knowledge of quenching the Spirit. I am putting facts before you.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You will find this phenomenon of prophecy, this ability to foretell the future, frequently present.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It takes many forms. I knew a man personally who had had this gift again in 1904 and 5.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It disappeared completely afterwards, but he was told beforehand of something that was going to happen in his church,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   not once, but morning by morning, awakened out of his sleep at half past two in the morning,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and given direct and exact information of something that was going to happen during that day.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And it did happen.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   There is another part of this mental phenomenon.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And then you get knowledge given to people, which is quite inexplicable.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   There were cases in Northern Ireland, for instance, of people who could not read, who could not write,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   who had never been able to read the Bible.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But suddenly they were given an ability to find places in the Bible, though they still could not read,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   and to make known the contents.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Well, I could keep you endlessly and for hours in giving further illustrations along this particular line.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Abilities have been given, gifts of discrimination, gifts of understanding, gifts of planning.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Here I say in this realm of the mental,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   quite astonishing powers have certainly been given to people for a temporary period.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Well, now, then, there are the main phenomena to which I am directing your attention,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   the physical and the mental.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   These things occur, may occur, during a period of revival.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And here is the question that confronts us.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   What is this?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   How do you explain it?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Now, that's why I'm putting it in the context of Acts 2.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   You see, this thing happened, the Holy Spirit was poured out and the results followed,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and here are these people at Jerusalem gathering together and saying, "What meaneth this? What is this?"
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And I said, "What are you asking a question for? The thing's perfectly obvious.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   These men are full of new wine. They're drunk."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Obvious explanation.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Ah, and people have continued to be like that throughout the centuries.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   There are various explanations that are put forward.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They were put forward a hundred years ago,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   as they've always been put forward in every period of revival,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   and they are still being put forward today.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And that is why I'm calling attention to all this.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   There are people, I say, who dismiss and denounce the whole notion of revival because of these phenomena.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And therefore, when they're exhorted to pray for revival, they say, "Most certainly not.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   We don't want that sort of thing. We are not interested in that type of experience."
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And thus, without realizing it, they're often conscious, they're often guilty of quenching the Spirit.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Now then, let us look at some of the explanations that are put forward, and especially today.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And may I add this, that I am particularly concerned about this,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   because, as you know, there is great interest in this matter at the present time.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And I know of nothing that is such a complete answer to some of these modern psychologists
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   who would explain conversion and everything else along their physical lines.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There is nothing which is such a complete answer to them, particularly, as revival.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Now then, let me show you what I mean.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   There are some who would suggest that all this is just some form or kind of what is now called brainwashing.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   You know how they put it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   They compare it with a technique that is being implied at the present time by the communists.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They compare it with what was so obviously implied by a man like Hitler in pre-war Germany,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   and even during the war in that country.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   "What is this?" they say. Well, they say, "This is quite obvious.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   What is happening here is this, that the minds of these people are being bombarded.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   They're gradually being worn down.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   They're brought together in crowds, or they're dealt with and kept in cells,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   and they're given insufficient sleep and insufficient food.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Everything is done to break down these people and their resistance.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And you speak at them, you shout at them, you bombard their minds.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And then when you've brought them to the point of collapse,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   you do it still more with a greater intensity of pressure, and they do collapse.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And then, in the state of collapse, it's the simplest thing in the world to indoctrinate them.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   You can insinuate your own teaching into their minds, and they will believe it and accept it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   They'll become devotees of it, and they will go out, and they will try to convert others in turn."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Well, now, there is their explanation. Let's be clear about this.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   That kind of thing, of course, can be done, and is being done.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   There is no question at all that that is precisely what Hitler did.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   There is no doubt at all that that is exactly what the communists are doing at the present time.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   By means of a given technique, they can thus break down the resistance of people's minds
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   and insinuate their own doctrines into them.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Well, now, here is the suggestion.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   The suggestion that is put forward is, you see, that what happens during these periods of revival is exactly the same thing.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Well, now, then, how do we deal with this?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Well, let me make this quite plain and clear.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I am concerned only to deal with revival.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I am not concerned to deal with evangelistic campaigns.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's very important we should draw that distinction.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And for this reason, that in evangelistic campaigns, techniques are used and used deliberately, but not in revival.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Now, I do want to underline and emphasize that difference.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   I am concerned only about revival, where no techniques are used at all.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   My argument has reference to nothing but that.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I am not concerned at this moment, this morning, to deal with what happens in evangelistic campaigns.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   There is a clear distinction to be drawn.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So I go on and put it like this.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   This suggestion, with regard to brainwashing, to give it its general term, completely fails in the matter of revival,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   because it completely fails to explain the beginning of revival.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Now, take, for instance, what happened in Northern Ireland.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   There it happened in the case of one man to start with.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It was exactly the same in the United States.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   It all started in just one man.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   There was no bombardment of the mind of this man, none at all.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   There was no technique implied.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   It was just one man, who himself became convicted of sin and was converted,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and then began to feel an impulse that he should tell others about it.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   There were no large crowds.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   There were no special techniques implied, none whatsoever.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   That is the amazing thing about the story, that it was just one man and then two others joining him,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and they prayed together for months, just the three of them in a prayer meeting.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   No bombardment of the mind at all.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   No particular technique brought to play with a desired resultant effect in their mind's eye.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Nothing at all.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Just three men prayed, and on and on it went for months, and slowly others began to come in.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Now, this suggestion, this attempted explanation, fails completely to account for the beginning and the origin of a revival.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Another thing it fails to explain is this, that it should happen in several countries at exactly the same time.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   That was not only true a hundred years ago; it was true two hundred years ago.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   When you had that great revival under Jonathan Edwards in the New England states,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   you had it in England, you had it in Wales, you had it in Scotland, and in other countries.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   It doesn't explain that at all.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Why should all these things happen at the same time in different places,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   where there was no contact and no knowledge whatsoever of what was happening?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It leaves it without an explanation.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And here's another argument.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Many and many a time have men tried to produce a revival in this way.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   They have read the accounts of revival.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   "Ah," they say, "now then, we see that this is how it happened,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   that one man began to pray and others joined him, or perhaps they began to pray right through a night,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   and then the revival broke out."
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Now they say, "We must do this."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   So they've done the very things that had happened during a revival.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   They've repeated them down to the smallest detail.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   They may have read Finney's book on revival, lectures on revival,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and they've put into practice everything that Finney tells them to do.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   He says, "If you do this, you'll get a revival."
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   They've done it all, but there hasn't been a revival.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   They've done their utmost with all their techniques and methods, but there has been no revival.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   They may have had a number of individual conversions, but there has been no revival.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Well, now then, this explanation, therefore, completely fails, you see, at that point also.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And lastly, it fails altogether to explain these interesting and curious mental phenomena
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   to which I've been directing your attention.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It just doesn't begin to explain them at all.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It does explain how you can indoctrinate a man.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   It does explain how you can bring a man to a decision.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   It does explain how you can influence the minds of men if you simply employ techniques.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Ah, yes, but we are concerned with these mental phenomena,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   these astounding prophecies, this amazing ability that is given, and these various other things.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And this proffered explanation does not even begin to explain such phenomena
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   which you get in connection with revivals.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Well, there's one explanation, but come to a second.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   The second explanation that is commonly put forward is that this is nothing but a case of mass hysteria.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Mass hysteria.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Ah, they say what's happening here, of course, is that these people have just become hysterical.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   You know what it is for a person to be hysterical?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Well, sometimes that becomes a sort of epidemic,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and large numbers of people become hysterical at the same time.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   What of this explanation?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Well, first and foremost, I would say once more
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   that it completely fails to explain the origin and the beginning.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   There was no evidence of hysteria at all in that first men,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   and the first group of men in Northern Ireland, none whatsoever.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   There were no phenomena at all there.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Same in America, same in Wales.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Why should this suddenly begin?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   There's no explanation.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Why should it spread?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Again, there's no explanation.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And may I put before you as a second answer to this charge
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   a series of points that were put forward by a Dr. Carson,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   who lived in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   who was obviously a very wise and careful and Christian physician,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   who was in the midst of all these phenomena,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   and who carefully collected them and analysed them,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and brought his mind to bear upon them.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Now, he pointed out that there were five points
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   which seemed to him to be more than adequate,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and I entirely agree with him, to exclude this diagnosis of hysteria.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And here they are.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   They're partly medical, but I think you should be interested in them.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   First, it is almost an invariable symptom of hysteria
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   that people are conscious of a ball in the throat.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   They feel they're choking, that there's a lump there,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and they're going to choke.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It's almost invariable in hysteria.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   There was no evidence of that at all in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Secondly, it is a characteristic of hysteria
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   that people laugh and cry almost at the same time,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   or change quickly from one to the other.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Uncontrollable laughter and uncontrollable weeping.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Sometimes they're almost mixed together,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   or they may follow in quick succession.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   There was none of that at all
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   in Dr. Carson's experience in the revival of a hundred years ago.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Thirdly, in hysteria,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   you almost invariably have convulsive movements of the limbs, the extremities.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Convulsive movements.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   He didn't see a single case of convulsive movements
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   during the revival.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Item number four, it's just a strict medical fact.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Hysteria is almost entirely confined to the female sex.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's just a medical fact.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   All the medical authorities you may like to consult will agree with it.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Hysteria is practically confined to women.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Whereas, of course, in Northern Ireland and in other places
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   where these phenomena appeared,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   they were found with equal frequency amongst men.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And lastly, he makes this very good point,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   that even in women, hysteria generally occurs in a certain type of woman
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   whose health is weak and frail.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Hysteria is practically confined to such women,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and is not true of all women.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And once more, the answer is, you see,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   that in Northern Ireland it affected all kinds of women,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   men, youths, strong, sturdy people.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   All this, you see, these five points, it seems to me, of Dr. Carson
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   are enough in and of themselves to exclude forever the notion of mass hysteria.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   But I would add this to it as a third point.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   The character of the men who have observed these phenomena,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I would have thought have been sufficient in and of itself
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   to exclude this particular diagnosis.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   If ever there was a cool, rational, intellectual man,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   it was the great Jonathan Edwards.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He observed these phenomena 200 years ago,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and he believed that they were of God.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Jonathan Edwards was not the type of man
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   who was likely to be deluded by hysteria, the very exact opposite.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   The same is true of others like Archibald Alexander and others
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   who have given their accounts of them.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And the same was true of these men like Dr. Carson and others in 1859.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Not only the people to whom the phenomena, in whom the phenomena happen,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   but the people who describe them and have accounted for them
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   is enough to put that out.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And lastly, my fourth argument is this, the results that follow.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Hysteria is utterly useless.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's enervating.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   There is something almost disgusting about it.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   It's a waste of energy,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   and it leads to no purposeful or beneficial result at all.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   It's something of which one should feel ashamed,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   in every respect and in its results included.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Whereas I've already reminded you of the amazing and astounding results
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   that have invariably followed in the case of revival.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Well, there is that second attempted explanation.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Let me come to a third, the psychic explanation.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Now this to me is much more serious.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   That first one, it seems to me, has no case for it at all.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   It's the same with the hysteria.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   But the psychic explanation I would regard as being much more serious.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And yet your modern psychologists hardly ever mention it.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   It's interesting in and of itself how superficial is their attempted diagnosis.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   But the psychic is much more serious.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   "What do you mean by psychic?" says someone.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Well, I mean things like telepathy.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   I mean strange phenomena which we don't understand,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   but which we know to be true.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Thought transference, mind transference.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I'm thinking of things like mesmerism.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   I'm thinking of something like hypnotism.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   These are phenomena which we cannot dispute,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   but which we find very difficult to explain.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   The ability of mind to influence mind.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   There are people who are born with a gift of being able to read other people's minds.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Those are men, for instance, like the late Professor Gilbert Murray,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   who was a typical intellectualist.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He wasn't a Christian, but he was a typical humanist,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   classical humanist and intellectualist.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Professor Gilbert Murray had the power to read other people's minds.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   He was often tested.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   He'd be in one room and the other people would be in another,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   and he could tell them what they were thinking.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Now, have you ever read about this sort of thing,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   these extra-sensory phenomena, as they're called?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   There are.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   The experiment with time, a book by Dunne.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   You're aware of these phenomena in the realm of the psychic,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   which cannot be explained.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Well, now, there are some who would have said that this is entirely what happens at a time of revival.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   But here, my answers would be these.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Why should this suddenly start
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   in people who'd given no evidence of having these powers before?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Why should it start suddenly?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Why should it be so common?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Why should it happen to masses of people at the same time?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Why should it suddenly stop, as it always does in a revival?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And again, we have this question of the spiritual results
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   that invariably follow a period of revival.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Let me hurry on.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   There is another explanation that's put forward.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   It's the fourth, and that is that all this is the work of the devil.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   That is what the Roman Catholics said about the revival in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   That's what the Unitarians said.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   That is what many people in the church said,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   who are virtually nothing but Unitarians also.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And that is what so many people today say.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   This is all the work of the devil.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But here, there are insuperable difficulties to this theory,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   and here are some of them.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Why should the devil suddenly start doing this kind of thing?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   What conceivable object can there be in his doing it?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Here is the church in a period of dryness and of drought and of aridity.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Why should the devil suddenly do this,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   which calls attention to religion and to the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Oh, let me put that strongly.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   By putting it in a second form, the very results of revival, I would have thought,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   exclude completely the possibility of this being the action of the devil.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Because the main result of revival, as I've kept on reminding you,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   is that thousands of people are converted to the Lord Jesus Christ and become true believers.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   The churches become too small and you have to build larger ones.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Men and young men crowd and offer themselves to the ministry,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and the gospel spreads in a most astounding manner.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Is the devil likely to do something that leads to that?
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   But listen to our Lord's own answer to this particular charge in Luke 11, verses 15 to 18.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Our Lord one afternoon cast out a dumb devil.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It came to pass when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake and the people wondered.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   But some of them said,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   "He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils."
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and a house divided against a house falleth.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And that's the final answer.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   If this is the work of the devil, well then the devil is an unutterable fool.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   He's dividing his own kingdom.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He's increasing the kingdom of God and of Christ.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   He's bringing people to salvation.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   He's working against himself.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   But the devil is not a fool.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   He has amazing wisdom and subtlety and ability.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   There is nothing which is so ridiculous as this suggestion that this is the work of the devil.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And listen to John putting it in his first epistle, chapter 4, verses 2 and 3.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   "Hereby know ye the Spirit of God."
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   If you're in any doubt as to what spirit it is,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   "Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   And this is that spirit of antichrist,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   "Whereof ye have heard that it should come."
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   A spirit that leads men and women to confess that Jesus is the Christ
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   cannot be the spirit of the devil.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It is the spirit of the living God.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Very well, then there we have hurriedly glanced at these false explanations.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   What is the true explanation?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   It's all before us, isn't it?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   "They were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, 'What meaneth this?'
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Others mocking said, 'These men be full of new wine.'
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said unto them,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   'Ye men of Judaea and all that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   and hearken to my words.'
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Then he brings out the negative, 'These are not drunken, as ye suppose,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   seeing it is but the third hour of the day.'"
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   He deals first with the false explanations and he ridicules them.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   He shows how utterly impossible they are.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And then he proceeds to the true explanation, which is this,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   "These are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   but this is what?"
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Well, this is that which was spoken by the prophet John.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And he goes on to quote the prophecy of John.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   What is the true explanation?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   The first thing we have to do is to remind you that even saintly ministers of God
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   have disagreed amongst themselves about the explanation of these phenomena.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   The men in whose parish the revival began in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   the Reverend J. H. Moore, he disliked the phenomena and he discouraged them,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   and there were practically none of them in the parish of Conor.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   But there were others who did not take the same view.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And there have always been differences of opinion.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Jonathan Edwards defended them.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   He believed that in the main they were of the Spirit of God.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   There was a man called John Berridge who preached in East Anglia two hundred years ago.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   He even encouraged them.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   He believed they were a remarkable sign of the Spirit of God.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Wesley and Whitfield, on the other hand, were unhappy about them and uncertain about them.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I say this that we may see that this isn't a simple matter,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   and that it behoves us all to approach the matter with caution,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and above all with reverence and with godly fear,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   lest we may make foolish statements, which we will regret later,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and become guilty of quenching the Spirit.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   How do we approach it? Well, let's approach it from the Scripture.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Has the Scripture anything to tell us about this?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Well, of course it has.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Does it tell us, "Well, go back to your Old Testament and read there about the prophets?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   How did these men receive their messages and how did they deliver them?"
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   The records tell us that they were in the Spirit, or a Spirit came upon them.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   They were in a state of ecstasy.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   They were sometimes in a state of trance.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   They were in an exalted mood.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Read the stories about King Saul, for instance,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   how the gift came upon them and the people said it became a common saying.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Is Saul also amongst the prophets?
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   A spirit of prophecy. It's perfectly clear there.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Indeed, there is another fact which is generally put in connection with this,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   how sometimes this spirit could be encouraged by the playing of music.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   How have you accounted for the prophecies?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Peter tells us, "Prophecy is not of any private interpretation,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   but holy men of God speak as they were moved or carried along by the Holy Ghost."
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   How did the prophecy come?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   How did this divine afflators come to the men?
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Be careful, my friends, lest you dismiss the prophets and the whole phenomenon of prophecy
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   as we have it in the Old Testament with your intellectualism.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   They were certainly laid hold of.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   They knew something about an ecstatic condition.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   But that's the Old Testament come to the New.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Look what happened here.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Look at what happened to these disciples themselves, these apostles and these other people.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Something so extraordinary happened that to certain people standing around they appear to be drunk.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   They say, "This is nothing but drunkenness. This is sheer madness."
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And often this charge of madness has been brought forward.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   It's a very, very phenomenon which are recorded in the second chapter of Acts.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   And then take the apostles' explanation.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   He says, "This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   This is what Joel said was going to happen.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   'It shall come to pass in the last day,' saith God, 'I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.'"
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   The Spirit had been given before, but He had not been poured out like this before.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   "I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh."
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It will be something overwhelming. It will be en masse, as it were.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Your young men shall see visions.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Your old men shall dream dreams.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy."
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   It happened to the mill girls in Northern Ireland.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Poor girls who had been brought up in poverty and penury,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   who were ignorant and who had practically no education.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   They suddenly began to prophesy.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   They displayed amazing knowledge and were able to speak in an unusual manner.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Doesn't it rather look as if the prophet Joel had anticipated this?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Had prophesied that it was going to happen?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Young men, young women, visions, dreams, prophecies, old men dreaming dreams.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   "That's what's happening," said Peter.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   "This is the pouring out of the Spirit of God."
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And the results are exactly as they were prophesied.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   But there are other effects.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   You will read in the 10th chapter of Acts, in verse 10,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   that Peter was upon a certain housetop
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   and that he was in a trance.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   The apostle Peter, in a trance.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And he had a vision.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   The sheets sent down were the various beasts, you remember.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   You will read in Acts 16 about the apostle Paul,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   that he wanted to go and preach in Asia.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   The Spirit prohibited him.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   He then wanted to go to Bithynia.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   The Spirit wouldn't let him.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And then he had a vision in the night.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   The men of Macedonia, the apostle Paul, had a vision.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   You will read in Acts 22 that he says this,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   "I was in a trance."
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Let's be careful, my dear friends,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   lest I say with our supposed scientific knowledge
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   we be found to deny the Scripture.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   When the Spirit comes upon a man, he may be in a trance.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And then you've got nothing to do but to read 1 Corinthians, chapter 12 to 14,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and to see that there were all kinds of phenomena in the church of Corinth,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   and the apostle has to instruct them and guide them and restrain them,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   and to say that everything must be done decently and in order.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Now there is the testimony of the Scripture.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Very well, what is our attempt at an explanation?
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   What is our conclusion?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Let me put them in a series of propositions to you.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Doesn't it seem clear and obvious that in this way God is calling attention
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   to himself and his own work by unusual phenomena?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   There is nothing that attracts such attention as this kind of thing.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   And it is used of God in the extension of his kingdom to attract,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   to call the attention of people.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   I'm sure there is that element.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Secondly, we must never forget that the Holy Spirit affects the whole person.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Other influences do.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Any powerful stimulus affects the whole person.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Have you listened on your wireless to the broadcasts of football matches and so on,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   or have you been to such places?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Haven't you seen people under the excitement shouting until they lose their voices?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   They stand up and wave their handkerchiefs.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   They hit people, they don't know what they are doing.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Now, it's not regarded as strange nor unusual when it happens in a football match.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   But because it should happen in a revival, people say, "Oh, this is all psychological."
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Haven't you seen people weeping in theatres and in cinemas?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Haven't you seen people going beside themselves under the influence of music?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Of course.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   You see, man is body, soul, and spirit.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And you can't divide these.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   And anything which comes powerfully to any part of man is liable to affect the other parts of men.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   We all know what it is for our bodies to affect our minds.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   If you're not feeling well, if you're bilious, or if you're ill, your mind doesn't function so well.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   On the other hand, if something happens to your mind, it affects your body.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   If suddenly you're stimulated, your whole body seems fit and strong and powerful.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   You wouldn't have believed it at the beginning.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Let's be very careful that we don't do violence to man's very nature and constitution.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Man, therefore, reacts as a whole.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And it is just folly to expect that he can react in the realm of the spiritual
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   without anything at all happening to the rest of him, to the soul and to the body.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And so, we must expect this kind of thing in a period of revival.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   We must expect different persons to react in a different way.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   We've got a perfect proof of that, of course, in the scriptures themselves.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   The same Holy Spirit inspired Paul and Peter and John.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And yet, I could tell you every time, if you read out a few verses to me,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   I could tell you which of the three had written them.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   The same Holy Spirit inspired the three.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Yes, but the message comes to us through the men that have been used,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   through their brains, through their temperament, through their mentality.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   That's not done away well.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   You can see the different style, the different representation.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   The same Spirit, but the manifestations differ.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   So it is in revival.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And thus, you see, you would expect children in a time of revival
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   to react more violently than adults.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   You would expect certain types of persons to react more violently than others
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   because they're that type of person.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   And so, it proves to be the case.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   All, therefore, that can be proved is this,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   that these phenomena are indicative of the fact
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   that some very powerful stimulus is in operation.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Something is happening which is so powerful that the very physical frame is involved.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I go on to say that we must remember that the phenomena
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   are not of importance in and of themselves.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   The phenomena, therefore, should not be sought,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   they should not be encouraged, they should not be bursted on.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   The phenomena, if I may use a modern term, are epiphenomena.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Epiphenomena.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Incidental, occasional concomitants and not a vital, essential part.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   And that is why the phenomena should tend to disappear as the revival goes on.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And actually, they have generally done that in practice.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And I would not hesitate to add this,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   that sometimes there are phenomena in connection with revivals
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   which seem to me to be due to nothing but to a sheer breakdown of the physical frame.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   You do get some people who become hysterical, actually hysterical in revival.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   There are people who manifest other psychic phenomena.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   There's no doubt about this, it seems to me.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   But I don't think there's any difficulty in explaining this.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   The body is weak.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Some bodies are weaker than other bodies.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And so when this mighty spiritual power comes,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   there are certain bodies that break down and they should be helped.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   They should be dealt with in a semi-medical manner.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   They should be prayed for, they should be pacified.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   And that is how these great leaders of revival have always dealt with them.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   But let us also remember this.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Whenever the Spirit of God is working in mighty power,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   the devil always seeks his opportunity.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   If he can discredit it, he will.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And he has always tried to do so.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   He has tried to bring in his counterfeits.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   He has tried to drive people to excesses.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And he has often succeeded with particular individuals.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   That is why you see you have so much in the Bible about testing the spirits and proving the spirits.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   We mustn't be misled.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   There are tests which are given and it is our business always to employ them.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   So I would conclude by saying that the phenomena are not essential to revival.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   They are not vital to revival.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   They are not religious in and of themselves.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   I believe that in their origin they are essentially of the Spirit of God.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   But we must always allow for the fact that because of the very frailty of human nature
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   and of our physical frames,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   you will always have the tendency to an admixture,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   partly along the physical, partly along the psychic,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   and partly as the result of the devil.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   But is there anything which is so foolish or ridiculous as to dismiss the whole
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   because of the character of a very, very small proportion?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   If you begin to do that, you will have to dismiss the whole of your New Testament.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Because here we are told that the other forces are ever trying to come in
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   and we must realize the true and understand it and withstand the other.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   The New Testament teaches us to expect this
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   and to be on guard against the false and the spurious.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Very well then, we end by saying this.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   These phenomena, as the whole revival, is as the apostle Peter says,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   the result of an outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   We mustn't seek phenomena and strange experiences.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   What we must seek is the manifestation of God's glory and his power and his might.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   What we must seek is reviving.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   What we must seek is an outpouring of the Spirit of God upon us.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   And when that comes, it will be so amazing
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   that strange and unusual things may happen.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   But we shall always know that it is God moving amongst us
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   and we shall be ready to identify the false, the spurious,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   that which indeed belongs even to the evil spirit, and restrain it.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Anybody who tries to work up phenomena is a tool of the devil.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   He's putting himself into the position of the psychic and the psychological.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   No, no, we mustn't be concerned about these things.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   We must keep our eyes on the glory of God and the outpouring of the Spirit
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   and leave it to God in his sovereign wisdom
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   to decide whether to grant these occasional concomitants or not.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   There should be no difficulty about differentiating between the work of the Spirit
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   and the work of fanatical men
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   and the work of these unseen forces and powers
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   and the work of the devil himself.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Well, let us be careful lest we quench the Spirit
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   and let us keep our eyes fixed upon the glory of God
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   and the outpouring of his Holy Spirit. Amen.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
