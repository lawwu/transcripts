[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Well, with the recent launch of John Piper's new book, "Reading the Bible Supernaturally,"
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.000]   we have a lot of Bible reading questions in the APJ inbox, and we love it. Keep sending those in to us,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   including this question that comes in to us from a man named Philip.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.500]   "Dear Pastor John, I really enjoy the way you go through individual verses and explain them very clearly
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000]   by breaking them down and explaining each part.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I understand that meditating on small parts of scripture can be helpful as we suck out all the nourishment from it.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.500]   But sometimes my problem is in understanding the entire chapter or larger sections of the Bible.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.500]   I read something like John 8, and although I can understand small parts of it, I really get lost and fail to follow
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000]   the entire flow of Jesus' arguments or where the chapter is going.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Sometimes reading a psalm can be quite incoherent to me too,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500]   and I don't quite get how one sentence flows into another.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.000]   So could you help me? Help me figure out ways to understand larger sections of scripture as a whole,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.500]   rather than just small chunks disconnected from other parts."
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.000]   Let me see if I can help. First with an analogy,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   namely an analogy of a jigsaw puzzle,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and then with an exhortation about the hard work of seeing a whole chapter whole,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500]   and then give an example from my own experience.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.000]   Think of a larger unit of scripture, like a chapter or a few paragraphs or maybe several chapters.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.500]   Think of it as a jigsaw puzzle, a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500]   For me, this is just like the way I go about it.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   There are 500 pieces laid in front of you, and as you look at them,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.500]   they do not look at all like the painting on the front of the box.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   They are just one big jumble.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   And that's how the words and phrases and clauses might look to you in a chapter in the Bible
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   when you try to think of the chapter as a whole.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   There are just lots and lots of words and phrases and clauses that might say some nice things,
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   but my, oh my, they don't make one big picture.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   How do you go about seeing the whole picture instead of 500 scattered pieces?
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   And of course, the Bible doesn't have a picture on the top of the box.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   You're working a little harder here.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   How do you see a chapter as a whole with a main point,
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   with all the pieces fitting together to make that main point
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   instead of just seeing 60 or 70 scattered clauses and phrases?
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   That's the goal.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   You take one piece, right?
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   I love to do puzzles like this because I love figuring this out.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   You take one of the pieces, and you look at the piece very carefully.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   You don't just keep scanning your eyes.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   Over 500 pieces superficially, oh, let me see something.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   Oh, let me see. No, no, no, no.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   You get nowhere that way.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   You take one piece, and you examine it very carefully.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   And you notice that half of this piece is solid red,
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   and the other half is gold, solid gold.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   And you notice that the little protrusion at the top is split in half,
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   and half of it is gold, and half of it is red.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   And from this, you infer with careful thinking that there is another piece somewhere here,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   somewhere that will be half red and half gold.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   And instead of a protrusion, there's going to be an indention
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   in the bottom of the piece leading up into half red and half gold.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   And now you're looking very specifically for that piece.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   And you scan the 500 pieces, this time looking specifically for that.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   And you find maybe six or seven or eight pieces that have this half red, half gold.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   And you slide them around looking for how they can fit together.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   You push them off to the side of the table in a corner,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   and you find one or two that fit, and then another, and another.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   And pretty soon you realize that you've got five, six, seven, eight pieces all fitting together.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   And you notice, oh my, this is a robe draped over the arm of a throne.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   So that's going to go here probably.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   You set that mid-size unit aside now, and you do the same thing all over again
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   with another piece with its peculiar characteristics, fitting the pieces together as you go.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   So that's how you build little pieces into mid-size units.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   We might call those two or three verses or a paragraph.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   And we've got maybe five paragraphs that are going to fit together.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   But now you've got several, maybe three, four, five, six, seven, eight mid-size units.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   And you should be able to discern of those three, four, five verses in each unit,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   what's the main point there because of how they fit together.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   Now here's my exhortation.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   One of the reasons we don't move from the part to the whole in reading the Bible
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   is because it is very hard work.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   It is hard work to fit all the mid-size pieces together so as to see the whole.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   For most of us, I certainly include myself here, we simply cannot do this in our head.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   And there's where people run into trouble.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   They're reading devotions, and they're trying to do this in their head.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Well, I can't even begin to do this in my head.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   We have to do it on paper.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   We have to write it down.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   Now I don't think there are computer programs good enough to do this yet on screen
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   because of all the jumbled jotting and line drawing and circling I have to do.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   We have to jot down the main point, the red and gold mid-size unit means robe over the arm of a throne,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.500]   that kind of a thing, and then we jot down the next main point of the next mid-size unit and so on
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   until we've got it on a piece of paper, six, seven, eight sentences,
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   which now each one sums up the mid-size unit in the chapter, in the larger unit we're trying to understand.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   And then we try to go about seeing how those mid-size units relate to each other.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   And my exhortation is simply don't give up on that.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   Use a pencil and a paper.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   Draw lines between them.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   You have no idea how they might all fit together.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   You'll be amazed at what you're able to see by trying to fit those mid-size units
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   and their main point together to make the larger piece.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   Now here's my closing example of how I've done it recently.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   I've been baffled over the years by the main point of Psalm 8.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   It seems like the main point is, "Oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth,"
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   because it begins with that and it ends with that.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   And that's a wonderful structural thing to see.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   But in the middle, you've got these babies who cry out,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   "And God gets victory over his foes through the mouth of infants."
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   And so I jotted that down recently.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   I even made a look at the book about this just a few weeks ago.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   I jotted that down.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   I said, "Okay, so the meaning of the first part of the Psalm, just the first couple of verses,
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   seems to be God gets victory over his foes by babies saying things."
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   And I have no idea how that works. None.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   That's just what it says.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   So I jotted that down.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   And then the next unit, which seems just totally different,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   "I behold your heavens and the things, your handiwork,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   and what is man that you're mindful of him,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   and through this man who's just a little lower than the heavenly beings,
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   you govern the whole world with fish and birds."
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500]   And I said, and I tried, now what's the main point?
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   I've put a few pieces together here.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   I want to jot down on my piece of paper the main point of this mid-sized unit.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   And I jotted down, "God exercises dominion over his earth
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   through insignificant man who compared to the stars seems like nothing."
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   And as soon as I wrote it, I saw, oh, I get it.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   The babies are insignificant, and God works his victories through babies,
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   and man is insignificant, and God exercises dominion through man,
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   and then he ends it.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   How great is his glory and his majesty.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:17.500]   Surely then, the point is, one of the peculiar aspects of the majesty
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   and glory of God is that he gets his victories,
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   and he exercises his dominion through the use of weak and insignificant things.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   Amen, amen. Praise God.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   And it's exactly the use that Jesus makes of it, or that Matthew makes of it,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   as Jesus enters the city on Palm Sunday where the babies are crying out,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   "Hosanna," and he's on a donkey of all things.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   So the point is, look at the pieces very carefully.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   Fit them together in mid-sized units.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.500]   Jot down the main points of the mid-sized units
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   until you have them all on a half sheet of paper,
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.500]   and then think and think and pray and pray and think and pray and think and pray
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   and organize and draw lines and try to fit them all together
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   until they fall into place, and you see how these five, six, seven, eight, nine points
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:16.500]   of the mid-sized units are in a flow that make one big overarching point.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   And you will be surprised if you take up pencil and paper and do this what you will see.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   Wow, that's a lot of help, and puzzles are a great metaphor for reading large sections of Scripture.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.500]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   That is doing Bible reading in the macro picture, putting together big chunks.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.500]   And in a couple of weeks we have a question about how to read a particular passage,
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   really doing Bible reading in the micro sphere.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   Stay tuned for that.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   We're going to cover that more in future weeks.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   Well, we have run up again against the weekend,
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.500]   and that means it's time for me to remind you to subscribe to our podcast
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   and to find our audio feeds and search our episode archive,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   and even reach out to us by email with a difficult question you might be facing
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   or a Bible study question on the brain.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.500]   Please send those in to us.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   You can do all this through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   Well, speaking of hard questions, what do we do with the lingering sense of regret
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   that we feel for wronging people with our sins in the past,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.500]   wrongs that cannot be forgiven by the ones we have wronged?
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   What do you do when it's too late for reconciliation?
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   This is a sobering and humbling question,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   and it comes to us from a listener who wants to know.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.500]   We will begin next week with it.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.500]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.500]   [end]
