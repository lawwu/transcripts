[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:42.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.320]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.000]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.960]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.280]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.560]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.640]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.760]   that you can find at boglecenter.net.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.680]   Now, before we get started with this episode,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.480]   I have a public announcement.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.120]   Tickets for the Bogle Heads conference have gone on sale.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.840]   You can find information on boglecenter.net and bogleheads.org.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.920]   The conference will take place in a suburb of Chicago
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.200]   on October 12 through the 14th.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.300]   It is a non-commercial conference.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.160]   There are no sponsors.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.960]   There is no commercialism.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.320]   No one is going to try to sell you anything.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.300]   It's pure investment education.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.800]   I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.860]   In this 45th episode of Bogle Heads on Investing,
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.000]   we're discussing total bond market investing, also called
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.440]   aggregate bond market investing.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.160]   And I have two special guests.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.600]   My first guest is Nick Gendron.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.160]   He is the Global Head of Fixed Income Index Product Management
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.240]   at Bloomberg.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.280]   Nick's team creates the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Market
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.880]   Index, which is the index that total bond market index
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.120]   bonds follow.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.840]   The next guest is Josh Barrichman.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.280]   He is Principal and Head of Fixed Income Indexing
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.600]   at Vanguard.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.320]   Josh's team are portfolio managers.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.800]   They take the index that Bloomberg puts together,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.160]   and they have to create a real live working portfolio out
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.760]   of it.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.080]   And that's quite a challenge.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.000]   We're going to start first with Nick,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.880]   and then we're going to move on to Josh.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.200]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Nick Gendron.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.320]   Welcome to the Bogle Heads on Investing podcast, Nick.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.480]   Thank you very much, Rick.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.520]   Appreciate it, and really happy to be here with you.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.320]   Well, thanks.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.840]   You are the first guest on our podcast today.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.440]   And your job is to create the fixed income indexes that
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.560]   are used for index fund tracking.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   Before we get moving here and talking about total market
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.120]   index or the aggregate bond market index, which
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.080]   is going to be our main focus today,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.840]   tell us a little bit about your background
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.320]   and how you got to be the head of Fixed Income Index Product
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.460]   Management for Bloomberg.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.160]   Yeah, sure, I'm happy to share that.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.480]   I actually joined Lehman Brothers a few years
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.280]   after I got out of college.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.440]   I was going for my MBA back then,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.600]   and they were really looking for people
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.920]   to come in and help them as they were starting to really build
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.600]   an index business, just come in and help with client support
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.480]   around indices.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.400]   They were starting to get a lot of questions
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.060]   around what they were doing, and Lehman Brothers was certainly
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.800]   a big bond shop.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.080]   So it made sense that they were producing
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.240]   these types of indices to share with the marketplace.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.560]   But I really came in in more of a client support role.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.480]   Didn't know much about bonds at the time,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.120]   but was looking for a change of career,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.760]   and they gave that to me.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.440]   And the rest was history.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.760]   I just kind of kept moving through the system.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.320]   We did a lot of portfolio strategy work for clients
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.080]   with our indices, et cetera.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.300]   And we learned all sorts of risk analytics
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.280]   and provided those to the marketplace as well,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.800]   and ultimately evolved into Barclays
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.040]   once Lehman went under in 2008.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.160]   And then Bloomberg bought our franchise from Barclays
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   in August of 2016.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.880]   So I've been at Bloomberg for about the past
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.680]   five and a half years.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.800]   - So if I hold that up, you have been involved
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.680]   in fixed income indexing for 30 years
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.200]   as of next month, correct?
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   - That is correct.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   We're coming right up on the 30 year anniversary,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.560]   which is really hard to believe,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.080]   but it's definitely been an exciting run,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.480]   and it's kept me in the business
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.920]   because the business just keeps changing
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.880]   and the needs of investors keep changing.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.800]   And it's definitely not a rinse and repeat type industry.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.320]   There's always innovation needed
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.080]   and lots of interesting client conversations to have.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.680]   - Now originally when you went to Lehman Brothers,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.200]   the number of index funds out there were fairly limited.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.040]   - Yeah.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.200]   - So the purpose of the indices that you were running
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.840]   were more for benchmarking.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.680]   So can you describe the difference between indexes
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   for a benchmark versus index for an investable product?
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.560]   - Many clients use our indices
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.120]   for what we call just benchmarking.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.520]   And for just standard benchmarking,
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   clients, they really need a home base
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.880]   or a foundation from which to make investment decisions.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   If they use the US Ag, for instance, as a benchmark,
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.240]   that's what is considered market neutral.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.880]   So for them to prove
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.280]   that they can use their investment prowess, if you will,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   to add value, that's a great place to compare yourself to.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.200]   If the US Ag is truly meant
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   to be a market neutral representation of the universe,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.800]   we do have many clients that just use that
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.520]   to compare themselves to and manage their risk
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   to that benchmark each day
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.560]   while hopefully showing out performance.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.120]   From a passive side of things,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.360]   certainly most ETFs, if you will,
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.120]   and many mutual funds and many institutional funds
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.560]   really try to track the index exactly
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.320]   by the basis point almost in fixed income.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   So it really is a difference between passive versus active.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.240]   - It's interesting that a lot of the index fund managers
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.280]   use the term total bond market
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   for the US aggregate bond market index.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.000]   And Barclays doesn't use that term, total bond market,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.480]   because it's not the total bond market.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   So could you explain what is the US aggregate bond market?
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.040]   - Yeah, I mean, in some ways, Rick,
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.080]   it's intended to be the total of some bond market,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.680]   but the question is what bond market is it supposed to be?
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.840]   And in the case of the US aggregate,
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.080]   it's really designed to be a representation
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.800]   of what I would call the core investment grade
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.920]   US dollar denominated.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.360]   So if you're in the US, any US dollar bond,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.640]   but again, the key thing is core investment grade
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   US dollar denominated.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.280]   And then we have to give it a name, right?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.280]   And US AG has been sort of the trademark name
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.000]   for a long time, and it's become a flagship name
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   in the industry.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.880]   Again, we could have at some point in time,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.120]   way back when decided, hey, we're gonna call this
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.680]   the total bond market index, but we decided,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.800]   nope, US AG is a better name.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.480]   And again, total bond market to me would be
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.720]   every bond out there, it could be any asset class,
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.280]   it could be any currency denomination, et cetera.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.800]   So again, it really depends on the market
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.960]   that you're talking about.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.840]   - That's interesting because it really,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.240]   there's a lot of types of bonds, US bonds,
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   that are not in the US aggregate index,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.520]   which is the basis for total bond market index funds.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.800]   The one that jumps out is TIPS,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.400]   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.160]   Gosh, I mean, this seems to be such a natural fit
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.600]   for a total bond market index fund,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.240]   but it's not in the aggregate index.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.800]   So why don't you start with that
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.360]   and kind of go down the list?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.600]   - You've prompted a very interesting dynamic
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.440]   when TIPS started to be issued in 1997.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.960]   And the reason I remember that exact date
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.320]   is just because that was actually the birth,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.160]   if you will, of what we call our index advisory councils,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.120]   which became more formal meetings
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.640]   with our major index users to get feedback
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.160]   on how we evolved the methodology within our indices.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.640]   But TIPS was a huge debate back then.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.080]   Our inclination when TIPS were issued
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.920]   was to put them in the US Act.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.200]   There were many investors and many that disagreed
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.800]   with that sentiment that inflation itself
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.640]   really should be a separate asset class
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.120]   and doesn't belong in the true spirit
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.360]   of a traditional fixed income investment.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.760]   So there was a debate.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.720]   And if you went around the industry today,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.640]   you'd still probably get several investors
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.880]   who would think that TIPS should be part of the US Act.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.760]   But that's some of the interesting part
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.840]   of being an index provider
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.120]   is investors don't always agree on everything.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.000]   The bond market has a lot of different factors,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.120]   a lot of different types of securities that are out there.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.000]   And we have to work to try to synthesize
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.640]   all of that feedback, if you will,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.520]   into what we feel should be in the US Act.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.960]   So there was actually a real good debate about it.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.160]   And it's something that we've brought up over the years
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.200]   with our index councils.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.520]   1997 wasn't the only time.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.040]   But still as of today, TIPS are not part of the benchmark.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.480]   - And this is an investment grade index,
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.760]   so there's no high yield.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.640]   - No high yield.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.120]   Completely separate high yield index.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   And the definition of ag for us is investment grade
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.600]   is one of the keys.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.400]   We have what's called a global ag too,
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.360]   which spans 28 currencies, but it's all investment grade.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.960]   So again, separate indices for high yield
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.800]   for emerging markets, municipals, inflation, et cetera.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.080]   The ag part of it, the investment grade part
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.040]   of the bond market is by far the largest component.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.360]   - And ironically, something that is in the index,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.520]   which a lot of people don't know,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.800]   are what are called Yankee bonds,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.840]   which are foreign bonds.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   - Yep.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.280]   Yankee bonds are an interesting dynamic.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.800]   There are a lot of non-US institutions
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.880]   or government bodies, what have you,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.960]   that issue US dollar denominated securities.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.080]   So just a little research on this,
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.280]   there's actually in the US ag,
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.520]   there's 1,400 securities that are Yankee bonds.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.480]   - Wow.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.400]   - Almost 2 trillion of the index is in Yankee bonds.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.960]   So you say, okay, well, who are those issuers?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.200]   Many of them are these supranational institutions,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.440]   IBRD, which is International Bank
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.400]   of Reconstruction and Development, EIB,
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.120]   European Investment Bank, ADB, Asia Development Bank.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.600]   So there's these supranationals that issue a lot of debt
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.640]   and most of it is in US dollars.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.240]   So those go in the US ag, they're investment grade debt,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.000]   but yeah, they're non, governments like Mexico,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.680]   Peru, Philippines, all issue investment grade debt
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.160]   in US dollars, that's in the US ag.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.280]   It's an interesting component of the market.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.240]   Canadian provinces issue US dollar denominated debt.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.080]   So those are some examples of Yankee bonds.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.880]   There's certainly other government bodies
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.000]   that issue US dollar denominated bonds as well
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.120]   that are what are called 144As,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.360]   or they're not SEC registered bonds.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   And that's another rule of the US ag.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.200]   They have to be SEC registered.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.080]   So Saudi or Indonesia,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.040]   they issue US dollar denominated debt as well,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.000]   but it is in 144A form.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.840]   So that does not go into the US aggregate index.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.480]   These are just some of the rules
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.640]   that have been in place for a while
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.840]   and we revisit them every so often,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.400]   but that's how we stand today.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.920]   - What would you say the percentage
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.800]   of the US aggregate index is in Yankee bonds?
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.160]   - So I guess it's just a matter of the math.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.040]   It's pretty easy to figure out.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   If the US ag is about 25 trillion
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.160]   in size and Yankees are two trillion of that.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.960]   - Oh, about 8% almost.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.800]   - Yeah.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.620]   - Yeah, and you know, it's funny
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.460]   because a lot of people say,
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.120]   oh, we need to invest in the US bond market
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.240]   and we need to invest in foreign bonds.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.200]   And I tell people, well, I mean,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.680]   the US total bond market index funds
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.120]   already have this 8% already in foreign bonds
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.680]   and they're shocked at that.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:33.440]   Let me ask about US strips, zero coupons.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.480]   In the US aggregate index,
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.920]   one of the rules is that it has to be a fixed rate coupon.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.480]   It can't be a variable rate coupon.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.600]   It has to be fixed rate.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.760]   Do you consider zero coupon bonds to be fixed rate bonds?
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.200]   - That's a good question.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.920]   My answer to that would be yes,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.840]   as long as they're originally issued as zero coupons.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.960]   So US treasuries are stripped from normal bonds.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.520]   So we include the normal bonds in the index.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.560]   We don't wanna create sort of stripped out versions
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.200]   of those bonds or something that would be,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.960]   cause us to double count those securities.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.160]   So we just take the outstanding amount
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.040]   of the originally issued security
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.360]   and that's what goes into the index.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.840]   - Let's talk about mortgages
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.680]   because you get the pure mortgage
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.640]   and then you've got collateralized mortgage obligations,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.040]   packaged mortgages, if you will, tranches and so forth.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.000]   So it would be double counting if you had both of these in.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.240]   So which one do you count?
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.360]   - It's just the straight mortgage pools that are issued.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.200]   We don't have CMOs in the index,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.880]   but what we do is we take all of the residential mortgages
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.880]   as issued as pools and then aggregate those into the index.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.320]   And as of today, there's about,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   I think it's about 25, 26% of the indexes is in mortgages.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.040]   - And these mortgages are government backed only?
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.720]   - Yeah, or agency backed.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.520]   So they're backed by the three agencies,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.800]   Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   We're tracking 30-year issuance, 15-year issuance,
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.040]   20-year issuance,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.640]   really where the market is most concentrated.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.760]   And certainly there's, again,
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.800]   this is really where the bulk of the mortgage market is
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.280]   today and over time.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.280]   As of today, again, in what we call our US ag
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.400]   or sort of the core universe,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.000]   it's only those residential mortgages
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.800]   backed by those agencies.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.360]   - So you've been around for 30 years now
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.560]   in this bond indexing business
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.400]   and you have seen something like the US aggregate index
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.120]   shift, not only does it shift in composition
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.160]   as more mortgages versus corporates
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.320]   or treasuries are created,
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.480]   the sectors get bigger and smaller.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.000]   And how is the index shifting?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.680]   How has it shifted?
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.920]   And how is it shifting?
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.760]   - Yeah, again, Rick, what we're doing every month,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.480]   basically, just a quick background.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.640]   Every month, we have a set of rules
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.560]   for what bonds go into the index and which don't.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.120]   And every month, that's a monthly rebalancing.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.920]   Every month we go out,
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.440]   we capture the bonds that meet the rules
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.160]   and we rebalance the index.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.360]   So it's very unique.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.440]   It's very different from stock indices, right?
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.680]   There's bonds issued all the time.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.480]   So we wanna keep current with what the market looks like.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.720]   And that's similar to how other competitor indices
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.560]   do it as well.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.000]   Monthly rebalancing is fairly standard in the industry.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.120]   But what that does is it incorporates
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   and continues to show as issuance patterns differ
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.600]   and as mortgages pay down and as corporations come in
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.160]   and out of the market to issue bonds,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.560]   what our index is doing is just reflecting
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.600]   the updated reality of the situation.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   So a good example, how have the sectors changed
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.560]   over the years?
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.760]   Well, if I look at U.S. Treasuries, for instance,
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   today, U.S. Treasuries are about 39% of the overall index,
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.840]   but they've been as low as 22% down in 2002.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.000]   They've been as high as almost 50% in 1985.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.400]   They're sort of at one of the higher points
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.800]   that they've been in a little while,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.160]   but it just is totally fluctuated based on
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.960]   how the U.S. Treasury is deciding to issue debt
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.840]   and in what maturities and in what size, right?
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.160]   And we just reflect that reality as the market
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.040]   just sort of evolves and that whole evolution takes place.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.280]   So it's kind of an interesting part of it.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.960]   You don't really see it month to month,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.460]   but if you look at over long periods of time,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.200]   you'll see the trends.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.720]   And the interesting in the bond market,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.200]   which is different than the stock market,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.000]   is that the stock market is set by buyers and sellers.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.920]   So the stocks you like, like Google and Apple,
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.520]   more buyers, price of the stock goes up,
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.560]   it becomes a greater percentage of the index
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.000]   because of demand, if you will, from the marketplace,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.960]   buying more stock and pushing the valuations
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.800]   of these companies up.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.560]   But that's not really what happens in the bond market.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.000]   In the bond market, it's how much the issuers issue
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.960]   that determine--
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.800]   - Yeah.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.840]   - The sector allocation.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.680]   So it is quite different.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.240]   - It's market value weighted.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.120]   So price, you know, the price of a bond as it goes up,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.560]   it will contribute a bit more,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.080]   but it's really the main bulk of the percent weight
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.520]   of that bond is gonna be how much it has issued in debt.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.920]   You know, we are market valuating each bond in the index.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   So price does factor in.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.800]   But again, I think, as you said,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   it's the amount outstanding of the bond times the price.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.600]   And there's a crude value in there too for a market value,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.880]   but which sets the weight of a bond in the index.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.800]   - So this year, 2022, we've seen interest rates move higher
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.120]   and the value of fixed income across the board
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.380]   has moved down because of that.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.220]   - Yep.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.080]   - And this function is called duration.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.560]   So we can measure how much it's going to move down,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.280]   the prices move down based on how much
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.720]   interest rates move up.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.460]   Can you number one, speak about duration,
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.600]   and then talk about how duration changes
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.080]   if interest rates are very low,
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   there's higher duration when interest rates are very low,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.800]   and there's lower duration when interest rates are very high.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.680]   Could you explain the whole concept of duration
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.640]   and how it moves?
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.600]   - Sure.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.280]   With the U.S. ag, it's interesting because
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.920]   government and credit or corporate portions of it
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.680]   are what you call positively convex bonds,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.240]   but the mortgage piece of it reacts actually
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   the complete opposite way.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.200]   So I'll go through that dynamic,
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.440]   but the duration of the index definitely fluctuates
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.880]   with the interest rate environment.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.840]   It tends to be because the U.S. ag
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.800]   is about a third in mortgages.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.640]   It's a little less than that.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.360]   It's probably a quarter mortgages now,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.520]   but over the course of time, it's been about a third.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.400]   When rates move in a certain direction,
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.840]   mortgages are very, very volatile
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.380]   with respect to their durations,
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.160]   because if you get into higher interest rate environments
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.160]   like we are today, even though we're not at the peak points,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.320]   the mortgage duration is completely dependent
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.840]   on what type of prepayments are expected in the marketplace,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.280]   because they're all callable securities.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.300]   If rates go low, obviously everybody's gonna pay down
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.320]   their mortgages and try to lock in a lower rate,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.560]   and therefore the existing mortgages in the index
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.880]   are all gonna pay down, and new ones are gonna be issued,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.180]   and so the duration can get quite low
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.540]   in low interest rate environments.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.060]   In higher interest rate environments,
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.860]   as we've moved up recently,
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.420]   the duration of the mortgage sector
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.940]   is about in the fives right now, 5.5 if I'm not mistaken.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.660]   It got as low as less than a year
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.660]   back in 2008 at the financial crisis
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.980]   when the rates were really dropping
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.140]   and homeowners were finding money very cheap
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.940]   and refinancing, et cetera.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.480]   - So you were basically saying that
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.000]   when the duration was less than a year,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.760]   that there's just a big, huge turnover
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.600]   in the mortgage market.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.080]   People were refinancing and now that interest rates
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.560]   have moved up, a lot less of that is going on,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.400]   so people are holding on to their mortgages
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.640]   and makes the maturity, if you will,
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.000]   of the bond much further out.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.760]   - Much further out, much more exposed
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.360]   to interest rate risk, right?
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.920]   And in the end, duration, as you mentioned,
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.700]   is really how prices are gonna respond
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.620]   to interest rate moves.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.140]   So it's all interest rate risk.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.460]   That's the main risk that almost every
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.940]   fixed income investor is worried about
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.040]   is what's the duration of the index?
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.420]   What's the duration of my portfolio?
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.700]   If you are mismatched there
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.220]   and everybody knows it's tough to time duration
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.020]   or tough to time interest rates,
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.380]   you can really get on the right side of that
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.040]   and do very well, but if you're on the wrong side of it,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.360]   it's gonna be your main reason
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.220]   why you've underperformed in fixed income.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.060]   So if we look at the duration
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.360]   of how it's drifted over time,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.320]   the US Ag was down at about three and a half years,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.440]   down at that heart of the financial crisis,
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.840]   as I mentioned, in 2008,
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.640]   'cause mortgages were so low in duration,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.960]   but it's now at 6.6.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.480]   So an investment in the US Ag gets you a duration of 6.6.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.640]   And like you said, we've not had worst performance
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.100]   in the bond market in 40 years.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.000]   The first quarter of the US Ag, we're down almost 6%.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.460]   It was the worst quarter since 1980.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.820]   So it's 40 years since the bond market
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.020]   has performed this poorly.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.180]   The US Ag has generated negative returns
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.340]   in seven out of the last eight months,
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.460]   which is unheard of in fixed income.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.540]   So it'll have a tendency to really right the ship.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.840]   It's supposed to be a fairly stable investment,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.140]   but when rates move directionally like this
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.500]   for extended period of time,
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.780]   which we have not seen for a long time,
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   it hits every part of the bond market.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.340]   And look, you can look at every asset class,
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.860]   not just US Ag, whether it's high yield,
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.060]   whether it's global bonds, whether it's emerging markets,
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.540]   and we all know what Russia did to that situation,
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.540]   but it's been a tough quarter for fixed income investing.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.500]   - So we've talked about duration,
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.540]   and duration as a measure of interest rate risk,
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.560]   and the fact is when interest rates go up,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   the duration of mortgages goes up,
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.100]   but the duration of coupon bonds like treasuries
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.700]   actually goes down, correct?
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.900]   - You can kind of know how much a regular bond
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.660]   is gonna move as far as duration,
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.300]   just based on a mathematical calculation of a bond.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.460]   And they'll move, but not as significantly
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.980]   as a mortgage-back.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.820]   And the thing with the mortgage-back securities
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.820]   is they're dependent on the prepayment model
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.980]   you're using as well.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.140]   So you can argue over what the duration
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.540]   of a mortgage-back security is based on,
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.660]   you know, we've got a great prepayment modeling team
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.900]   here at Bloomberg,
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.860]   but if you look at a rival index provider,
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.940]   it's gonna say the duration of the mortgage universe
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.540]   is different than what we say it is.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.580]   - Well, let's talk about that,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.540]   'cause really, in a way, you're talking about
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.180]   how do you price bonds?
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.500]   And we know that a lot of the bonds in the US aggregate,
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.140]   in fact, all bonds, all bond indices have bonds
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.420]   that don't trade, unlike stocks.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.780]   A lot of the fixed income doesn't trade.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.940]   So these models are pricing the bonds, correct?
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.460]   And so you have to actually price each bond every day,
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.140]   even though it's not trading?
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.980]   - That's right.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.300]   So, you know, there's different price providers
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.660]   we've used over the years.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.020]   Our, what's called our D-Val team here at Bloomberg
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.300]   is Bloomberg's pricing service.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.620]   And they provide all the pricing
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.060]   for the bonds in the index.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.740]   Prior to us joining Bloomberg,
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.580]   we used a combination of vendor pricing,
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.900]   but a lot of it came from our Barclays or Lehman traders
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.220]   who were trading the bonds all the time.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.780]   And we did have a pricing team back then,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.180]   which would work with them and price the index.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.860]   So the pricing of the index has evolved over time,
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.420]   and now we're using pure D-Val prices.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.220]   They do a great job of pricing the universe,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.260]   but you're right.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.380]   For the bonds that you are able to see,
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.180]   you know, trades on every day,
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.940]   or bids or offers on every day,
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.380]   you can price those very, very well.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.060]   Part of the universe does have to be model price.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.660]   Like if a bond of a certain issuer,
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.940]   if you can price that one fairly well,
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.020]   but the other one doesn't trade,
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.580]   you're gonna have to deduce sort of a movement of that bond
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.460]   or what's called the spread of that corporate bond
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.980]   relative to treasuries fairly in line
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.980]   with how the other bond of that issuer moved.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.380]   There's other ways to model bonds as well,
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.980]   bonds of a similar quality, industry, that type of thing.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.220]   But universes like treasuries are very easy and liquid,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.380]   and you could come up with really, really quality prices.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.220]   And for most of the bonds in the index,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.300]   you could definitely have observations for,
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.660]   but others you're gonna have to model price for sure.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.580]   - Now the index funds themselves,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.180]   the ones who are managing the index funds,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.860]   they also have to price their portfolios on a daily basis.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.620]   And some of the bonds in those portfolios
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.420]   may not trade on a daily basis.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.580]   So are they using the same pricing
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.060]   or is there some discrepancy between what they're using
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.060]   and what you're using?
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.220]   - Yeah, that's a great question,
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.300]   probably a great one for Josh as well.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   But yeah, they have to use services or pricing services
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.780]   to price their portfolios.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.820]   In some cases, they will use BVAL
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.860]   because they believe in the quality of those prices
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.220]   and they'll use BVAL.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.580]   Not every client does.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.900]   There's many other competitor pricing services out there
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.540]   that do a good job.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.980]   And clients use who they feel
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.760]   are the right pricing vendor for them.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.620]   But you're right in the saying that
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.460]   if an investor is using a different pricing service
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.860]   than the index, you could be exactly matched
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.100]   on every constituent of the index
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.820]   but still show different performance than the index
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.540]   because of the difference in pricing services.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.780]   So it's not an exact science, that's for sure.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.180]   So you will have some tracking error because of that.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.940]   - So last question and we'll wrap it up.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.140]   And this has to do with derivatives, if you will,
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.460]   off the US aggregate.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.540]   And I know that Vanguard uses a float-adjusted.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.500]   As far as the float-adjusted index,
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   there's bonds in the market that are held by the Fed.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.340]   And certainly as part of the financial crisis,
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.900]   the Fed's always bought treasuries.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.600]   And just in all transparency,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.340]   those have always been excluded from the US ag from day one.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.100]   That's just part of our methodology
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.680]   'cause it was a very consistent pattern
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.980]   and it's been baked in as part of the methodology forever.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   So the amount of treasuries in the float-adjusted
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.700]   and in the standard US ag are exactly the same, okay?
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.540]   The mortgages though were another debate back in 2009
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.900]   once the Fed started buying mortgages.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.820]   Should we take them out of the index
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.300]   or should we keep them in?
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.380]   'Cause they had never been in the game before.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.540]   Back then, nobody knew how long it was going to last
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.540]   nor did we actually have the information at a Q-SIP level,
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.340]   especially early on, to start taking them out.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.820]   We can't just guess.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.140]   Over the course of time,
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.260]   and the information became more transparent,
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.180]   but when we were trying to make a decision
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.140]   about what should we do with all this,
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.620]   with the Fed holdings of MBS,
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.980]   there was, again, a lot of good conversation
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.780]   with this about our clients.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.620]   Due to the uncertainty of how long the Fed
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.820]   was going to be in the game,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.140]   should we take out all the bonds
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.940]   and then have to put them back in and that type of thing?
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.220]   There's a lot of good points brought up.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.460]   So that's how the float-adjusted version
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.500]   of the US ag was born was the main difference
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.900]   is the amount of mortgages in the two indices.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.100]   So if I could give you a couple stats,
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.660]   it's the mortgage part of the index.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.660]   Our US ag has about 30% in securitized
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.740]   and that's mortgages plus only a small portion
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.140]   of ABS and CMBS.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.900]   The float-adjusted ag has 22.3.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.580]   So we're almost seven and a half percent less
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.740]   in terms of securitized debt in the float-adjusted index.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.100]   And that means the other sectors just go up a scaled amount.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.660]   So there's basically more corporate bonds
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.940]   in the float-adjusted ag and there's more treasury bonds
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.260]   in the float-adjusted ag.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.300]   - So which one outperformed this last quarter?
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   - I looked at that and the difference
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.980]   was only seven basis points.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.220]   - Oh, is that all it was, okay.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.900]   - It was really minor.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.060]   Now, again, I haven't done all the attribution on it,
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.060]   but as of right now, the difference in,
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.740]   you would think the different, the duration of the,
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.660]   because we've talked about mortgages being
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.820]   at their highest duration in a while,
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:06.220]   but the curious part is the duration
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:10.100]   of the other components is higher
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.500]   than the overall duration of the US ag.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.220]   So even though securitized or mortgages
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.460]   at their highest in a while,
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.780]   it's still not the same duration as the other components.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.420]   So that being said, the float-adjusted index
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.140]   is about 0.15 years longer in duration
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.220]   than the standard US ag is right now.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.380]   - So not much, not much.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.180]   Well, Nick, it's been extremely educational.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.020]   Thank you so much for being on BogleHeads on Investing
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.900]   and we greatly appreciate all of the insights
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.260]   and good luck with the next 30 years in this industry.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.620]   - Really appreciate you having me on today
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.500]   and look forward to speaking with you soon.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.020]   - Our next guest is Joshua Barrichman,
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.420]   Principal and Head of Fixed Income Index Investing
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.100]   at Vanguard.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.380]   So let me introduce Josh Barrichman.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.700]   Welcome to BogleHeads on Investing, Josh.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.060]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.220]   - Josh, you've been at Vanguard since 1998
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.780]   and now you're the Head of Bond Indexing,
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.620]   managing about a trillion dollars in assets.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.420]   So it's a big responsibility.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.660]   But before we jump into bond index funds
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.780]   and the total bond market index fund,
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.540]   could you tell us a little bit about yourself,
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.580]   a little about your background?
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.420]   How did you get into this position?
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.700]   - Yeah, sure, happy to.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.980]   So I grew up in Ohio and went to school out there,
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.300]   studied finance, made my way East
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.700]   to go to business school
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.180]   and started up with Vanguard in 1998
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.900]   in one of our tax departments.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.020]   Did that for about 12 months
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.900]   and got an opportunity at that point
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.940]   to move to the fixed income group
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.620]   as a trader for our municipal bond funds.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.260]   So I was able to do that for three years,
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.420]   trading various different asset classes within municipals.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.660]   And then in 2002, had the opportunity to move over
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.900]   to our fixed income index team,
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.780]   which at the time was a rather small team,
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.420]   maybe eight folks total,
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.060]   but a really great opportunity for me coming up
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.900]   to really get to work with some luminaries in the field
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.700]   of indexing, folks like Ken Volper, Craig Davis,
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.100]   Chris Allwine.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.220]   Was able to grow my career on the index desk,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.020]   various roles as trader, portfolio manager
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.340]   across a lot of different asset classes.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.340]   Then in 2013, I took over as head of the desk
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.820]   and I've really been in that role ever since.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.340]   You know, the index desk in particular
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.860]   has been really a dynamic place to work
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.780]   and have a career just with just the amount
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.580]   of different markets that we've banded into, ETFs,
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.300]   kind of list goes on and on in terms of how the business
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.140]   has grown and changed over the time I've been there.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.980]   So it's been a great place to have a career.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.340]   - How many different funds are you responsible
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.180]   for managing both the US and internationally?
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.820]   - Yeah, so the global footprint for bond index
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.100]   is around, you know, 80, 85 different mandates.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.420]   Kind of depends how you classify certain things,
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.980]   but yeah, about 85 mandates
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.820]   and just around a trillion dollars in AUM.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.500]   - And how much of that is US versus outside the US?
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.980]   - Yeah, the bulk of it is definitely in the US.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.420]   You know, I would say the breakdown's probably around 80, 20.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.100]   - And the flagship product in the US
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.300]   is the total bond market, all share classes?
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.140]   - That's right.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.180]   - And by the way, you have different
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.380]   total bond markets, correct?
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.900]   You have the total bond market one,
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.620]   you have the total bond market two,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.980]   you have total bond market ETF.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.340]   How many different total bond market funds are there?
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.380]   - There's really two.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.900]   There's total bond market and total bond market two.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.020]   The ETF, you can really think of as an extension
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.980]   or a different share class within total bond market one.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.140]   It's really just a share class of that fund.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.380]   There's the total bond market two product,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.780]   which is really in place to serve as the bond option
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.220]   for some of our multi-asset strategies.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.980]   - Is there any difference between how they're managed?
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.540]   - No, they're gonna be pretty close to one another
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.740]   in terms of overall strategy and composition.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.940]   For different reasons, for cash flows and things like that,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.460]   you will have some deviations,
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.860]   but we're talking very much at the margin.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.660]   - Well, I have some question about if one fund,
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.020]   one bond index fund, total bond market index fund,
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.900]   needs a bond and total bond market index fund number two
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.140]   has a bond, is it legal to just move it
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.380]   from one fund to another at NAB?
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.460]   Can you do that?
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.940]   - It is, it is currently.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.100]   Those rules are likely changing in the short term,
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.380]   but there is a process that we can go through
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.180]   that allows us to cross trade between funds.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.660]   There's an approved process with our risk team
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.500]   to make sure that everyone's being treated fairly.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.780]   But as of right now, that is doable going forward.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.820]   And like I said, the rules will be changing around that.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.380]   - Is that because of SEC or because of Vanguard?
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.860]   - An SEC rule change, yeah.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.700]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.100]   So the bond would actually have to go out of one fund
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.900]   to someplace else and then come back into the other fund?
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.820]   - Yeah, the two funds would not be able to cross
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.180]   directly with one another.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:23.860]   Given kind of the nature of the bond market,
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.260]   it's not a guarantee that that particular bond
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.500]   would make its way back to the other fund.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.460]   There's a lot of friction in the fixed income markets
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.700]   relative to an exchange traded market
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.060]   where certain bonds are gonna be available certain days
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.380]   and then they may not trade other days.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.940]   So you can never be sure that you're gonna be able
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.060]   to get the bond that you want when you want it.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.220]   - You have a short-term bond index fund,
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.100]   intermediate-term bond index fund,
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.340]   and so there's different pieces of, say,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.180]   the aggregate bond market that are broken up
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.740]   into different maturities, different credit ratings.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.980]   And right now, if a bond,
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.660]   let's say that was in the intermediate-term
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.540]   corporate bond fund, got to a certain maturity
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.540]   where it would normally be sold,
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.260]   and the short-term corporate bond fund index fund needs it,
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.140]   you could move it in, but what you're saying going forward,
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.540]   you may not be able to do that?
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.380]   - That's right.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.820]   At least not directly in between the two.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.100]   Again, an NSEC rule would prohibit that going forward.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.260]   - Is that rule already in place
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.540]   or are you just anticipating it's going to happen?
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.620]   - It'll be in place, I believe, in September of this year.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.220]   - Do you think this will add costs
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.180]   to managing these portfolios?
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.940]   - Yeah, we've kind of gone through
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.460]   a lot of different scenario analysis
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.860]   of how we can handle this,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.940]   and at the end of the day, it's pretty de minimis.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.740]   In some ways, it adds opportunity for us
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.060]   to be a little bit more strategic
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.660]   on how we move bonds from one fund to another.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.700]   Throughout the month, we may have opportunities
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.300]   where, because of new issues, we might be overweight credit,
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.540]   and that might be a decent time
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.900]   to sell out of those bonds that you described
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.660]   that might be falling out of that benchmark
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.780]   and things like that.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.180]   So we've kind of gone through a lot of different iterations
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.940]   and feel like we're in a pretty good place
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.140]   to have a small, if any, impact to the funds.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.300]   - So the total bond market itself,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.900]   the index that you're tracking
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   is the Bloomberg US Aggregate Float Adjustment Index,
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.500]   and that index has 12,500 bonds in it.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.780]   And according to the latest information
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.980]   on the Vanguard website,
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.940]   the total bond market fund has about 10,150.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:37.940]   So this is a discrepancy there of maybe 2,300 bonds.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.980]   And so why would there be such a large discrepancy?
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.740]   Whereas if this was a stock index fund,
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.580]   it would generally be almost every stock
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.860]   that trades out there.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.060]   So why is it not that way with bonds?
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.300]   - Yeah, it's a good question, Rick.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.180]   I mean, the example, I think that kind of clarifies it a bit
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.940]   is you've got stock index funds
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.620]   that have securities that trade on exchange.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.340]   So something like an S&P 500,
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.260]   it's quite easy to go out and buy those 500 stocks
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.740]   in the right proportions and get tracking that benchmark.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.260]   What you don't have in the bond market
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.020]   is that same exchange traded mechanism.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.140]   So everything in the bond market trades over the counter,
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.140]   which really means that as a trader or PM,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.100]   you need to go out and find the bonds
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.580]   that you need to trade.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.260]   And you also have a dynamic
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.700]   that the fixed income market
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   is really a buy and hold market.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.420]   A lot of securities that don't trade,
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.220]   that get purchased at new issue
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.980]   and get the term is put away.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.580]   They get put into someone's portfolio
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.940]   and you really don't see them come out.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:39.220]   So what sort of happens then is because of those dynamics,
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.540]   myself, my team, we need to go out
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.660]   and build samples of the markets
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.100]   to replicate the major risk factors
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.700]   to ensure that we're gonna get tight tracking.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.420]   But we need to do it in a way
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.020]   that understands that there are limitations
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.660]   of what we can and can't buy.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.580]   And we have to be by definition,
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.340]   overweight some things and underweight other things.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.340]   The team here will break the market
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.900]   into sort of subcomponents.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.700]   And we have experts that will be responsible
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.700]   for building the sample within that subcomponent
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.260]   with a bent toward trying to add a little bit of value
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.260]   at the margin.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.860]   Tracking is always job one for us,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.340]   but understanding that we have to be overweight
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.500]   some places and underweight others.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.620]   We try to do that pretty deliberately,
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.900]   leverage our credit resources, credit research team,
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.900]   as well as our traders' expertise
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.420]   to continually buy bonds that are a little bit cheaper,
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.980]   sell the bonds that are a little bit richer.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.940]   And over time, you have that accrued to the funds.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.980]   - And in your analysis, how much of that
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.340]   has actually accrued to the funds?
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.940]   Did you have like a basis points
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.340]   or something that you could point to and say,
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.460]   yes, we actually added this much value
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.260]   by doing that type of trading?
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.900]   - Yeah, it's not a typical year.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.660]   We're not talking about huge numbers here
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.380]   in terms of basis points.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.220]   One to two basis points would be pretty typical year.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.060]   First of all, we're generally able to overcome
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.900]   our transactions costs and then even to the expense ratio
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.260]   by maybe a basis point or two basis points.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.980]   So not huge in terms of basis points,
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.580]   but when you convert that into dollars and cents,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.940]   you're talking about some pretty big numbers.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.900]   - So the total bond market has a ETF
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.980]   attached to it as a share class,
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.700]   but that trades differently than cash
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.660]   coming into the total bond market fund itself.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.420]   And the ETF share class, according to the data
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:27.300]   on your website is about 83 billion or so
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.900]   of that 300 billion in the total bond market.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.060]   What I'm really curious about is,
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.300]   does it enhance the fund in some way?
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.900]   In other words, the performance or does it lower the cost
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.580]   because you have this ETF share class?
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.420]   - Yeah, like you mentioned, it's really just a,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:47.020]   it's a separate share class of the total bond one fund.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.060]   So a lot of ways we're indifferent
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.060]   about how cash comes to us.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.540]   If it comes through the mutual fund,
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.060]   it's more traditional in cash.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.820]   If it comes to us through the ETF channel,
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.180]   it's gonna be more of an in-kind bonds.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.740]   Having the ETF attached,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.860]   it has a couple of nice benefits for us.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.940]   It allows us to add additional diversification
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.980]   through the ETF channel as we negotiate custom baskets
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.460]   with market makers and we're taking those in every day.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.100]   You're able to take those in on the bid side of the market.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.260]   So in a way we're able to grow the asset base
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.140]   without explicit transactions costs attached to it.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.180]   And there's also some tax deferral benefits
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.620]   through the in-kind process.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.100]   And when we do have redemptions,
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.380]   we're able to send out some of the lower cost lots
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.620]   that we might otherwise have to trade at a gain.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.060]   So those couple of things are additive
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.660]   to the mutual fund shareholders from the ETF.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.300]   - Let me circle back to just the observation
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.260]   about the titling of the total bond market index fund.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.580]   And the reason I circled back to this
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.580]   is because when I interviewed Nick from Bloomberg,
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.900]   they call it an aggregate bond,
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.940]   a US aggregate bond market index,
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:04.940]   but Vanguard calls the fund a total bond market index.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.580]   So could you explain,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.580]   why does, I guess my question would be,
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.260]   why doesn't Vanguard call it
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.980]   the US aggregate bond market index?
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.220]   Why is it the total bond market?
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.300]   - Yeah, it's really the broadest fund that we offer,
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.340]   at least that's purely US focused.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.420]   It's really probably the investment grade component of it
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.580]   that we would say is the total investment grade market.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.740]   And some of the components
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.060]   that people might argue should be included
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.700]   would be things like high yield and EM,
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.460]   but then you're sort of straying outside
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.980]   of this investment grade mandate.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.500]   And frankly, I think people have certain expectations
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.980]   of bonds that probably align a lot more
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.580]   with investment grade performance
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.620]   versus being in something that's high yield
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.100]   or emerging markets that at times
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.820]   they're gonna trade a lot more
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.500]   with a higher high beta to equities at times.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.020]   So it's really the investment grade piece
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.940]   that we're wrapping that total label around.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.740]   - I think it was 2010 Vanguard decided
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.220]   that they wanted to change the index
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.820]   that they were tracking slightly to a float adjusted index.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.380]   And this is different than your competitors like iShares.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.260]   Why Vanguard made that change
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.500]   and made that decision to go that direction?
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.940]   - Sure, in terms of the float adjustment,
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.420]   the standard US aggregate has always adjusted
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.860]   for Fed holdings of treasuries.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.380]   So if you compare the ag versus float adjusted ag,
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.100]   that component is the same.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.980]   Where there was a deviation
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.500]   was when the Fed started to buy mortgage securities,
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.700]   post GFC and start to take those onto their balance sheet.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.980]   The decision was made that the sort of top level ag
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.420]   was not going to adjust for those.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.260]   We felt pretty strongly that it would be best practice
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.900]   to adjust for float that's being taken out of the market.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.020]   Really the biggest difference as you see between the two
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.740]   is the weight in mortgages is quite a bit lower
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.020]   and the float adjusted, but that then redistributes
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:04.860]   the entire pie.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.780]   So you'll get a bit higher in credit exposure,
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.780]   you'll get a bit higher in treasury exposure.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.180]   We felt it was best practice.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.660]   We don't wanna be trying to buy in markets
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.860]   where we know that the Fed is out there
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   and in somewhat of an uneconomic way
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.740]   taking supply out of the market,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.660]   but it's not perfect, right?
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.540]   You could argue, like I said, it's a buy and hold market.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.740]   There's a lot of bonds that are on balance sheets
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.820]   of foreign banks on insurance companies or pensions
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.060]   that are probably never gonna trade,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.580]   but the data to really do something like that
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.140]   just really isn't that reliable and available.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.700]   So we felt it was a good step.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.460]   We felt it was the right step for our investors.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.420]   Looking at it over five year look back,
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.620]   float adjusted has outperformed slightly,
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.300]   hasn't really been dramatic,
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.220]   but a slight outperformance over a five year period.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.980]   But what you will see too is as the Fed
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.980]   is going to unwind QE and let mortgages roll off
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.300]   and let treasuries roll off
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.220]   and potentially if they get more active actually sell,
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.980]   what you will see is that float come back into the market
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.980]   and you'll see a convergence then
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.540]   between the float adjusted ag
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.740]   and sort of the standard ag.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.180]   - Well, let's talk about return for a minute
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.980]   because it has been a difficult market here for investors.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.660]   I think that Nick was telling us
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.660]   that you had to go all the way back to I think the 1970s
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.060]   to find a period of time when in one quarter
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.620]   the aggregate bond market lost as much as it did
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.340]   in the first quarter of 2020.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.380]   So I wanna talk about the different elements of return,
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.900]   coupon yield, roll yield, capital appreciation,
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.380]   all the things that go into the return.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.220]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.540]   Really when you're investing in bonds,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.020]   you're generally investing to earn that yield
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.020]   and that yield is really a combination of coupon
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.780]   as well as the dollar price of the bonds
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.500]   in the portfolio at the time
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.900]   and sort of taken together that will give you a yield
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.620]   and that should be a pretty good estimation
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.140]   of what you should expect to earn
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.420]   over at least the short term.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.780]   We've obviously come from a period of really low rates.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.900]   A lot of times we'll think about things
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.460]   in terms of like breakeven spread moves
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.980]   or breakeven interest rate moves.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.340]   And when you're at such a low level of yield,
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.660]   a very low hurdle rate in terms of the yield
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.100]   that you're looking to earn or expecting to earn,
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.340]   it doesn't take much in terms of a backup in rates
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.500]   before you overwhelm that yield
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.100]   and you actually go negative in total return.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.500]   And that's what we've seen obviously
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.500]   over the past couple of quarters
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.460]   as inflation has kicked up
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.900]   and the Fed has been very vocal about their plans.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.060]   The golden rule that you always have to keep in mind
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.660]   is that rising rates aren't always a bad thing.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.380]   It really has to do with your investment horizon
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.180]   and the product that you're in.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.660]   So rule of thumb would say
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.420]   that if you have an investment horizon
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.180]   that's longer than the duration of your fund,
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.380]   you should actually welcome higher rates
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.220]   because what's gonna happen
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.100]   is you're gonna have an opportunity.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.940]   You know, as yields are higher,
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.260]   you're gonna continue to reinvest
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.580]   and that will continue to sort of accrue and compound
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.860]   through the life of that investment.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.620]   So like anything, it's always important
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.300]   to make sure you've got the right product.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.500]   It's within your risk tolerance or risk budget
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.660]   and you're able to ride it out
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.700]   because you are in the right product.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.300]   - I wanna talk about the concept of roll yield
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.260]   where you've got a yield curve now that's very steep
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.300]   and the total bond market aggregate,
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.500]   US aggregate index, once a bond gets to one year,
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.180]   it comes out of the index
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.380]   because now it's a cash element, it's a cash security.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.660]   If you're buying these at five years or six years
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.740]   and you hold it until one year,
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.980]   but you don't hold it to maturity,
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.660]   there's an excess return that you could pick up
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.700]   if you have this normal yield curve.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.260]   Can you discuss that and how that's affecting
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.900]   or how that has affected the return
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.740]   of this fund over the years?
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.740]   - Just kind of going back to this idea
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.780]   that we're building samples,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.540]   we make a lot of active decisions on a daily basis
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.860]   within kind of the construct of bond indexing,
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.940]   again, with tracking as a number one goal,
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.060]   but if something like you described,
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.260]   we're not mandated to sell something that goes under a year
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.340]   and if it's really attractive, we'd be happy to hold that.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.740]   And maybe that's a trade off somewhere else in the fund
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.060]   within our risk budget,
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.580]   but we always have the lens of, does that make sense?
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.380]   Can we hold onto a bond that has,
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.860]   we think has a lot of value
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.020]   and not take a bunch of risks elsewhere?
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.340]   You certainly can't do that all the bonds
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.260]   that are going to fall under a year
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.020]   or else you would end up taking a curve bet somewhere
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.580]   along the yield curve in the fund.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.940]   But there is a lot of discretion for us to do that
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.060]   when those opportunities arise.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.300]   - We got a question that came up with Nick
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.380]   and it had to do with pricing bonds
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.180]   because we've already discussed the fact
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.100]   these bonds that you have in your fund are put away.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.180]   They don't trade, but they need to be priced every day.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.820]   And Nick was telling us about the services
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.020]   that they use to price their bonds
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:05.900]   and does Vanguard use the same services or is it different?
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.340]   And if it's different,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.860]   how does it affect the NAV of the index versus the portfolio?
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.380]   - In most cases, we don't use the same service.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.940]   There are some pockets where we do.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.900]   For us as an index fund provider,
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.140]   that would probably be the lowest tracking option
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.940]   for us would be to use whatever value
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.460]   that our index providers come up with.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.500]   We found over the years
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.660]   that we want to take a little bit more of a broader look
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.540]   and use a variety of different pricing services.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.340]   So we bring in two or three or more prices every day
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.140]   for different markets.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.700]   Our pricing team within our fund accounting group
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.300]   will do the due diligence to really quality check
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.820]   all the different pricing sources
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.100]   and use the ones that we really think are most accurate
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.700]   for that particular sector and that particular fund.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.900]   - Well, let me ask another question,
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.540]   maybe a little bit tougher.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.500]   When the bond market has a bad day
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.540]   and credit spreads just widen very rapidly
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:11.540]   and the liquidity just dries up, ETF prices plummet.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.220]   And sometimes ETFs close at much lower prices
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.620]   than their fund, their index fund equivalent.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.580]   I think we might've seen this back in 2020,
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.500]   might've seen it back in 2007, 2008,
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.260]   where we've seen this big gap
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.060]   between market price of the ETF at close
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.900]   and the actual NAV of the opened end fund.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.180]   And I think that a lot of people try to explain it.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.740]   A lot of people are saying that this is actually fair,
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.500]   but number one, could you explain what happens
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.220]   and your view of all that?
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.060]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.020]   So I think the example that you probably,
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.740]   or at least is most fresh in mind is March, 2020,
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.580]   when you saw for a small period of time,
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:57.180]   bond ETFs closing at relatively large discounts to NAV.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.180]   I think the first thing I would say
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.060]   is that was a really unprecedented period of volatility
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.820]   for the fixed income ETFs.
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.500]   And it was a pretty big test for how resilient
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.500]   they would be.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.260]   I guess I'll go back to, first of all,
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.500]   the diligence that we put into our NAV
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.740]   makes us feel really good about where we're coming in
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.220]   every night with NAV pricing.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.020]   So the deviation on the ETF side has a lot to do
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.780]   with sort of the price of liquidity at that time
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.940]   in the marketplace and the demand
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.300]   for sort of instant liquidity taking place
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:33.060]   when you have a market that's somewhat frozen up.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.820]   And then you think about, okay, well,
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.300]   there should be this arbitrage mechanism
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.620]   that brings things back in place,
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.220]   but then you got to kind of think about
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.940]   the state of the market where it was
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.260]   and the arbitrage trades that would need to happen
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.060]   to close up that gap.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.020]   And that would sort of involve someone going out,
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.660]   buying shares in the market, redeeming them to the fund
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.940]   and getting bonds in return.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.980]   And in an environment like that,
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.020]   from hour to hour, from minute to minute,
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.180]   you don't really know what those bonds could be worth.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.780]   They could gap lower by two points
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.780]   by the time you get around to actually liquidating
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.300]   and trying to affect that arbitrage.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.540]   So there's just so much uncertainty and friction
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.180]   that that arbitrage mechanism definitely gets weakened
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.740]   a bit in those times.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:23.420]   But big picture, there were some small blips,
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.340]   but for the most part, we were very encouraged
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.140]   of how the fixed income market behaved
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.500]   and how resilient it was and how big of a part it was
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.340]   in terms of kind of ultimate price discovery
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.860]   over the course of a few months
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.780]   as the market tried to right itself
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.300]   and work out some of the volatility
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.100]   and the dislocation that we had seen.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.820]   - So most people who are buy and hold investors
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:49.140]   or should just kind of ignore these daily fluctuations,
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.780]   unless perhaps you wanted to do some rebalancing,
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.540]   in which case, if you wanted to do some rebalancing
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.700]   and that day in March where things went crazy
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.860]   and the gap between the trading price of the ETF
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:07.420]   and the NAV of the open-end fund was so wide
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.820]   that it would have been better off selling the open-end fund
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.620]   if you had those shares rather than the ETF.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.620]   - Right, the open-end fund
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.420]   would have probably been a better option at that time,
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.220]   but there's reasons that people hold the ETF
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.740]   and some of it is this instant liquidity,
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.380]   getting out midday.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.220]   We also have some frequent trading policies
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:36.220]   that would restrict folks from coming into
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.020]   and out of the total bond mutual funds,
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.500]   which wouldn't occur in the ETF.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.340]   So there's a lot more flexibility there as well.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.500]   So there's a little bit of trade-offs on both sides.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.620]   - Are you finding it more difficult trading bonds
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.380]   with the current environment?
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.540]   Ben talking about higher interest rates and so forth.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.980]   Does this create some illiquidity in the market?
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.900]   Is it more difficult for your desks?
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.620]   - I wouldn't say it's anything that's unexpected
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:05.060]   or out of the ordinary in a period of volatility like this.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.340]   I think anytime you go through this,
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.820]   there's a bit of a price discovery process.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.940]   It takes the market a while to settle in
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.780]   sort of back to more normal levels.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.500]   So there's a bit of it for sure,
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.180]   but yeah, I would say it's well within what we would expect.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.260]   - You're an important person.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.540]   You're managing a lot of money for a lot of people.
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.420]   Is there anything you wanted to add to this conversation?
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.620]   - I mean, I could just maybe offer a couple of thoughts.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.220]   We're obviously talking about total bonds today,
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.700]   but Vanguard has a really full lineup
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.100]   of both active and index products in the bond market
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.500]   that really offer investors with a lot of options
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.500]   and a lot of flexibility to tailor that bond exposure.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.740]   And we do believe in total bond as a core,
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.140]   but core doesn't mean a hundred percent.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.500]   If somebody is of the mind
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.940]   that they want more corporate exposure
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.700]   or they want a shorter duration or a longer duration,
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.060]   we have a lot of great options to supplement that exposure
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.540]   and make sure people get the risk
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.580]   that they're comfortable with
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:03.980]   and the risk that kind of fits
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.420]   their long-term asset allocation.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.300]   So again, total bond, we think is a great core,
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.980]   but there's a lot of other sort of building blocks.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:16.260]   We would call them to add on to build a bond portfolio
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.380]   that gets you really close to your objectives.
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:21.380]   - Josh, thank you so much for your time today.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:22.860]   I really appreciate the insight
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.580]   and I really appreciate what everything that you
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:29.180]   and your team do for us all at Vanguard.
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.020]   - Oh, thanks Rick.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.380]   It's been great.
