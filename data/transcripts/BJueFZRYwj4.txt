[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.320]   All right, we got a question here from Ian,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   who asked about meditative walks.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.720]   As I am walking around, I want to try and solve
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.520]   specific problems.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.800]   I'm curious to know, do you set a specific question
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.600]   for a specific walk?
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.520]   Do you let your mind wander?
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   Or do you return to the same question as distractions arise?
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.540]   What does thinking look and sound like?
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.880]   Well, this is productive meditation.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.800]   It's an idea that I included in deep work,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.080]   and I often talk about when I give keynote addresses
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.600]   about deep work.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.520]   It's my term for exactly what you're talking about,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240]   working on a professional problem
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.560]   in a preambulatory state.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   I'm going to use some unnecessary words.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.040]   Let me use another unnecessary word.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.200]   This is a peripatetic productivity maxim
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200]   that I call productive meditation.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.780]   So I give rules in that, based off of just hard one
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.920]   experience.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.040]   And the rules for productive meditation are one problem.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.720]   So you come back to it.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.000]   When your mind wanders, come back to the original problem.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.160]   When your mind wanders again, notice, don't judge,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.560]   but come back to the original problem.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260]   That's where the meditation piece
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.880]   of productive meditation, that phrase,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.680]   comes from, when I was doing a lot of this.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.040]   So I really got into productive meditation
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.320]   during my postdoc years.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.240]   During those same years, for whatever reason,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240]   I went on a big Jon Kabat Zinn kick.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.200]   I was reading Full Catastrophe Living
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.480]   and the various other books that Zinn had written.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.560]   He's really known for basically bringing
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   a secularized mindfulness meditation
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.560]   practice into the formal medical world.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.600]   That's what Jon is known for.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.280]   And so I had a lot of Jon Kabat Zinn going in my head
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.360]   when I was thinking about productive meditation.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   And what I borrowed then from him in mindfulness meditation
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.400]   more generally was the nonjudgmental noticing
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.600]   of your attention wandering, but bringing it back consistently.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.800]   That's usually what I do.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.920]   Now, what happens is you're going to notice a lot,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.840]   and bring it back a lot, notice a lot, bring it back a lot.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.160]   There is actually a function, a training function in that.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.400]   And meditation people hate this type of terminology.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.360]   So they don't like me calling what I'm talking about now
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.760]   something with the name meditation.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.960]   But it's true.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.080]   It helps your mind practice sustaining focus,
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.160]   because it doesn't get the reward.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.320]   It wanders over to an email that you have to write,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.640]   and you pull it back.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.460]   It wanders over to a conversation
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.460]   you had that you're worried about,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.200]   and then you pull it back.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160]   It doesn't get the shiny treat at the end of that distraction
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.000]   path.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.920]   And so the urge to do so reduces,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.880]   and you get better at sustaining your focus.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.500]   The other thing you get better at when
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.920]   you're doing productive meditation
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.360]   is facility with your working memory.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.920]   You can hold things in your working memory,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.400]   pull one of those items out, do some work on it, put it back in,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.080]   take out another element.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.600]   That is what you have to do in order
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.520]   to keep making progress when you're just on foot,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.920]   and you get better at it with practice.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   So productive meditation is pretty hard at first.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.640]   I usually describe it as cognitive pull-ups,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.600]   because pull-ups are an example of an exercise that's hard,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.860]   especially if you haven't been doing them.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.700]   It's just really hard.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.860]   You're heavy, and you're trying to lift your whole weight up.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.740]   But if you do them on a regular basis,
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.940]   it does work a lot of muscles.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.100]   It's very effective.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.780]   That is what productive meditation is like.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.140]   It's very hard at first, but if you do it consistently,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.820]   you get a pretty big leap pretty quickly in your ability
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.500]   to keep your mind's eye focused more or less on one thing,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.740]   and actually do pretty good progress on that one thing.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.180]   I will now do a fair amount of writing in my head.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.380]   I can make a fair amount of progress
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.380]   on math proofs in my head.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.380]   If it's a long walk, I'll bring a notebook with me
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.500]   to record things at a couple milestones along the way.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.940]   Like if I'm in the woods, I'll sit by a creek and do it.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.820]   If it's in my neighborhood, I'll just wait till I get home
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.980]   to take notes on what I was thinking about.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.380]   So read the productive meditation chapter in Deep Work Ian.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.820]   I think you'll like what you come across.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.400]   (upbeat music)
