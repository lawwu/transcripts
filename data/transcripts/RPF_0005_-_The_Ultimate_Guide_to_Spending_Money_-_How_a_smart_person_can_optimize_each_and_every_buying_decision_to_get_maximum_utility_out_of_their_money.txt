[00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.620]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 5. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.620]   Today's show is somewhat pompously entitled, The Ultimate Guide to Spending Money.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.420]   How a smart person can optimize each and every buying decision to get the maximum utility out of their money.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.940]   Now stick with me. I know that sounds a little bit pretentious and somewhat pompous,
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:35.320]   but the show is designed to be a comprehensive view of all the interesting ideas that I was able to come up with
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.720]   to get more value when you make a spending decision.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.780]   Essentially what this show is, I've sat down, I've brainstormed every way that I could come up with
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.260]   to make smarter buying decisions.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.860]   And hopefully by the end of the show, you'll have some ideas and some information that will be helpful to you.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.040]   Now, as I start off here, I just want to clarify.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.880]   These are simply ideas.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.100]   And it's possible that only one or two or three of them could ever be applicable to your life.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580]   I'm not assuming that any of them are applicable to your life.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.720]   They're ideas that I think have value and can be applied in a lot of different circumstances.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.720]   So, I also think that ideas...
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.580]   I personally love ideas.
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.900]   I love ideas because ideas have a tendency, once you think of them and understand them,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.760]   to mate with each other and to get themselves in a situation where they pop out right at the time that you need one.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.680]   So, I may say something today about, I don't know, a smart way of buying socks and underwear.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.940]   And a few years from now, you may be buying a car,
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.660]   and there may be an idea that's going to pop out to you.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.320]   So, that's okay.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.820]   So, today's show is going to be, again, an overview of all the different ideas I was able to come up with.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.860]   Interesting questions to ask yourself when you're buying something.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.160]   Now, obviously, these are a lot of questions.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.880]   I'm not thinking that anybody would ever ask themselves all these questions.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.100]   But think about them.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.300]   And apply them to different areas of your life.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   And at the end of the show, we'll talk about that.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.340]   First, though, before we get into the ideas, I want to get into the topic and the question of frugality.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.660]   Here's my question.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.640]   When is it okay for you to spend a lot of money?
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.140]   Frugality is incredibly important.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.360]   I'm not the frugality police, but frugality is incredibly important.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.280]   It's important at the beginning stages of financial success.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.160]   When one is just getting started putting together their financial plan,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.880]   just getting started earning money, making money, and investing money.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.500]   Every $10 you can invest at the beginning of your life has a huge potential future result.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.740]   So, frugality is incredibly important then.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.440]   I would argue that frugality is important later on down the road
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.100]   because the people who become wealthy are the ones who,
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.720]   who tend to practice these principles and they become a part of them.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.240]   So, frugality is important at every stage along life.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.820]   So, question one.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.780]   When is it okay for you to spend a lot of money?
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.420]   I've got four answers to that question.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.220]   Answer one.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.620]   Well, whenever you want to.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.480]   I know it sounds a little bit unusual, but it's your money.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.140]   You can do what you want to with it.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.040]   So, I'd say,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.840]   you can spend a lot of money whenever you want to
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.040]   because it satisfies something that's important to you.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.820]   Some random guy on the internet,
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.660]   it's not my job to tell you what to do with your money.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.640]   It's your money.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.300]   You earned it or it was given to you.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.980]   You can do whatever you want with it.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.600]   But obviously, you're probably not here to hear me tell you that.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.740]   But it is true.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.400]   Answer two.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.460]   It's okay for you to spend a lot of money
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.260]   when you've considered the opportunity cost of your purchase.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.020]   What are you giving up?
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.020]   What are you giving up with your choice?
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.020]   To me, opportunity cost is the key.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.020]   Each of us has a finite amount of time.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.020]   Each of us has a finite amount of resources.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.020]   The things that we choose to do or not do with our time and with our resources
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   are going to determine our choices.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.020]   Excuse me.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.020]   I guess our choices are...
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.020]   That's what we're doing when we choose.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   Each time we choose to do something ourselves,
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.020]   our opportunity cost is going to determine our choices.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.020]   The opportunity cost is what we could have been doing with the time that we gave up to do it.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.020]   Some people might find a task like mowing the lawn
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.020]   and they may say, "I need to hire that out."
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.020]   Because it's more valuable to me to spend the money on mowing the lawn
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.020]   than it is to give up the time that I have for it.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.020]   Now, on the other hand,
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.020]   the opportunity cost is also financial.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.020]   So, if you spend money on doing something,
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.020]   you're giving up what you could be doing with that money otherwise.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.020]   And, you're giving up what you could be doing with that money otherwise.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.020]   And, this entire show, practically,
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.020]   is talking at times about what those costs are.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.020]   But, if you've considered seriously the opportunity cost,
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.020]   what the alternative use of the dollar would be in your situation,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.020]   and you're satisfied with that,
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.020]   go for it.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.020]   When is it okay if you spend a lot of money?
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.020]   Answer 3:
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.020]   I would suggest that if you're interested in being wealthy,
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   it's okay to spend a lot of money when it's a small percentage of your wealth.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.020]   Rich people consistently spend only a small percentage of their wealth.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.020]   Rich people consistently spend only a small percentage of their wealth.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.020]   Rich people consistently spend only a small percentage of their wealth.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.020]   Rich people consistently spend only a small percentage of their wealth.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.020]   Rich people consistently spend only a small percentage of their wealth.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.020]   That's why they got wealthy, and that's why they stay wealthy.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.020]   If you find someone that's spending a higher percentage of their wealth,
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.020]   If you find someone that's spending a higher percentage of their wealth,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.020]   that's spending a lot more money than expresses a percentage of their wealth,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.020]   that's spending a lot more money than expresses a percentage of their wealth,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.020]   I can promise you two things.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.020]   Number one, they're not wealthy,
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.020]   and they're just spending out of income.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.020]   So, they're high income earners,
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.020]   and they're not high,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.020]   but they're not very wealthy.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.020]   Or, I can promise you,
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.020]   it's because they're not very wealthy.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.020]   Number two is, they're not going to stay wealthy long.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.020]   There are plenty of stories
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.020]   you can go on the internet and read about,
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.020]   and there are plenty of stories of very wealthy people
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.020]   and there are plenty of stories of very wealthy people
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.020]   who became wealthy and then spent it all
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.020]   who became wealthy and then spent it all
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.020]   because of foolish spending.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.020]   because of foolish spending.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.020]   Let me give you an example.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.020]   We often forget that rich people
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.020]   and wealthy people
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.020]   may actually be quite frugal
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.020]   because of the dollars involved.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.020]   An example that came to mind
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.020]   to me
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.020]   is the example of Paul Allen.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.020]   Paul Allen was the co-founder of Microsoft
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.020]   with Bill Gates.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.020]   Very wealthy man.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.020]   For some reason,
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.020]   he always sticks out in my head,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.020]   because of a yacht that he owns.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   Years ago, I remember the yacht being
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.020]   in a lot of articles that I would read,
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   it's this huge, fancy, expensive yacht.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.020]   So I went and looked it up
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   because I was interested in
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.020]   the numbers on it.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.020]   So, in 2003,
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.020]   Paul Allen bought a yacht
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.020]   named Octopus.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.020]   This thing is incredible.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.020]   It's an ocean liner.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.020]   It's got a helicopter pad,
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.020]   a couple of swimming pools.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.020]   It's huge. It's absolutely huge.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.020]   He paid $200 million for it in 2003.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.020]   According to various news articles
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.020]   which I've read and I'll link to in the show notes,
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.020]   it costs him about $20 million
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.020]   per year to run.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.020]   So, he paid $200 million for it
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.020]   and it cost him $20 million a year to run.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.020]   Quite a lot of money.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.020]   It's an avid, lavish expense.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.020]   I don't know what Paul Allen
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.020]   was worth in 2003,
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   but I looked up on celebrity net worth
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.020]   and in 2013,
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.020]   as I record this,
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.020]   the website estimates his
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.020]   wealth to be about $15 billion.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.020]   I don't know if he was wealthier back then
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.020]   or less wealthy. It doesn't really matter.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.020]   So, Allen's worth $15 billion
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.020]   and he pays $200 million for a yacht
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.020]   that costs him $20 million per year to run.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   Now,
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.020]   what I try to do is I try to make up
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.020]   an illustration.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.020]   I don't know how much he earns.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.020]   I have no idea what his return is on his investments,
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   on his businesses.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.020]   I don't know if he works for earned income
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.020]   and has consulting projects. I don't know.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   But, if I just make up a number
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.020]   and I say that he's taking a 5% income
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.020]   level off of his $15 billion
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.020]   portfolio,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.020]   he has $750 million a year of income.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.020]   $750 million a year of income.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.020]   Every year.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.020]   And it costs him $20 million
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.020]   per year to run his boat.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.020]   So,
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.020]   if you run some percentages on that,
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.020]   it's really interesting.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.020]   So, what I did was I ran the percentages
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   and I said,
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.020]   "What percentage of his
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   net worth
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.020]   is tied up in that boat?"
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.020]   And the answer is 1.3%.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.020]   And then I said,
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.020]   "What annual income does it cost him
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.020]   to run the boat?"
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.020]   And the answer is 2.6%.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.020]   So, the equivalent cost,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.020]   let's break these down to smaller numbers,
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.020]   it costs him,
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.020]   if the equivalent cost of somebody
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.020]   who has a net worth of $2 million,
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   so pretend you have a net worth of $2 million,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.020]   and therefore
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.020]   at 5%, using my same numbers,
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.020]   earns $100,000 per year
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.020]   from their investments.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.020]   It's like somebody in that situation
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   going out and buying a boat, which has a price
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   tag of $26,000,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.020]   and spending
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   $2,600 a year
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.020]   maintaining it.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.020]   Not that big of a deal now, huh?
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.020]   To me,
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.020]   I would think that's actually quite reasonable.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.020]   If somebody has a $2 million net worth,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.020]   $100,000 a year
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.020]   of income from their investments,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   they want to buy a boat that costs them $26,000
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.020]   and then spend $2,600
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.020]   a year operating it?
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   Go for it.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.020]   That's a reasonable number.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   It's actually quite a frugal number.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.020]   So,
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.020]   my thought is, make sure that
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.020]   your luxury spending,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.020]   or even your spending,
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.020]   is a small percentage of your wealth,
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.020]   if possible, if you care about wealth.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.020]   Answer 4:
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.020]   When is it okay for you to spend a lot of money?
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.020]   When you've seriously considered
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   the best way to get the maximum
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.020]   utility out of your purchase.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.020]   If you've really considered
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.020]   and thought about the best way to get a deal
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.020]   and to stack on
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.020]   a lot of utility to each and every
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.020]   decision,
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.020]   that's...
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.020]   it's fine.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.020]   If you don't do that, though,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   you find a lot of inefficiencies
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.020]   in your finances.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.020]   But if you'll do that,
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.020]   you can make excellent, very efficient
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.020]   buying decisions
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.020]   that will stand you in good step.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   So,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.020]   first, some general tips.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   When you're making
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   a buying decision, slow down.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.020]   Most people's
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.020]   mistakes would...
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.020]   they would be able to coach themselves
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   out of mistakes if they would slow down.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   Take time
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.020]   to research your choice.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.020]   Think about your choice. Plan it out
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.020]   and consider the options.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   Research the alternatives
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.020]   that you could do.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.020]   Think if this really meets your needs.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.020]   Plan the purchase out.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.020]   Manage your investment.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.020]   You can't just go
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.020]   and buy a lot of things
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   and then you're done.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.020]   You can't just go

[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.020]   You can't just go

[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.020]   You rent out your driveway
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.020]   and have income from it.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.020]   There's a new idea that's being tested out
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:05.020]   called Flight Car.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.020]   And the idea is that
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.020]   you can rent your car out while you travel
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.020]   instead of paying to park it.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:13.020]   So you fly,
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.020]   this company arranges for a rental of your car
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:17.020]   while you're gone
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:19.020]   and you receive income for it.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.020]   Obviously there's challenges associated with that
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.020]   but what a cool idea.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:25.020]   Flight Car.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.020]   Can you rent a spare room out on Airbnb?
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:29.020]   If you have a spare bedroom,
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.020]   rent it out for part of the time.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.020]   Or maybe you have a back,
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:35.020]   a little mother-in-law shack
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.020]   behind your house type of thing.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:39.020]   Incidentally,
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:41.020]   there's a great
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.020]   you can collect
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.020]   up to two weeks of income
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.020]   for the rental of your personal house
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.020]   and that income is received
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:51.020]   completely income tax free
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:53.020]   in the US tax code.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.020]   So can you do a house swap
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.020]   while you're on vacation?
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:59.020]   I'll link to an article
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.020]   Mr. Money Mustache wrote
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.020]   about what he did
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.020]   doing this. Renting his entire house out
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:07.020]   while you're on vacation.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.020]   What a cool way to finance a vacation.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:11.020]   What a cool way to take something that
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:13.020]   most people have as an expense
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:15.020]   and turn it into an income.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.020]   Can you pull income from something
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:19.020]   that's just simply usually an expense?
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:21.020]   It used to be that
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:23.020]   less now
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:25.020]   than in the past
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:27.020]   but in the past you could find companies that would pay you
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.020]   to wrap your car with advertising
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:31.020]   while you're driving around.
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.020]   These companies would pay you a fee
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.020]   based upon
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.020]   how much you drive every day
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.020]   and what your car is
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.020]   and they'll give you a wrap for a local company
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.020]   and that car becomes a rolling advertisement for them.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:45.020]   Well there's an expense
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.020]   that you usually have
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:49.020]   that you
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.020]   there's an expense that you usually have
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:53.020]   that you can now create an income stream from.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:55.020]   Because you put a billboard on your land
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:57.020]   I always think about the land owners that have
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.020]   land next to
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.020]   to highways
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.020]   and I wonder what the rents they receive
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.020]   on the billboards they put out there on their
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:07.020]   I'm sure it's not a ton but I'm sure it's
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.020]   better than nothing. Maybe it pays their property taxes
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:11.020]   or something like that.
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.020]   There are people who've tattooed logos
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.020]   on their body for pay.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.020]   There's a guy who started a
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:19.020]   I'll link to all this in the show notes
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:21.020]   There's a guy who
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.020]   wears a t-shirt for pay
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.020]   and so I think it's Iwearyourshirt.com
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:27.020]   or something like that.
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.020]   He allows people to
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.020]   send him their shirts
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.020]   and he wears them for pay.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.020]   and he wears them for pay.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.020]   and he wears them for pay.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:39.020]   This same guy
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:41.020]   his former name was actually
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:43.020]   Jason Sadler
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.020]   currently his name is
[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:47.020]   Jasonheadsets.com
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.020]   He auctioned off his last name
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.020]   He put up a website called
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.020]   buymylastname.com
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:55.020]   and auctioned off his last name
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.020]   and headsets.com is the name of the website.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.020]   Jason bought his last name for a year
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.020]   and so he's officially changed his name
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:03.020]   and everywhere he goes it's
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.020]   Jasonheadsets.com
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.020]   Interesting idea.
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.020]   Can you rent an extra room in your house
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:11.020]   or build an apartment behind your house to rent out?
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.020]   There are a lot of times where
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:15.020]   maybe someone has a little bit of land
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:17.020]   could you build just a small garage apartment
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.020]   and rent it out for several hundred dollars a month?
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.020]   That can be substantial over time.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.020]   The point is that consider if there's
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:25.020]   something that you have that's currently
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:27.020]   an expense or where you have space and figure out
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:29.020]   if there's a way to get paid for it.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:31.020]   Could you buy an RV for your business
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.020]   and then wrap it with your business name
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.020]   for the advertising?
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:37.020]   Can you turn an expense into an income stream
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:39.020]   by using your inside knowledge?
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:41.020]   So for example
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.020]   if you're into wearing expensive name brand clothes
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.020]   can you buy them at good deals
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.020]   from consignment shops
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.020]   and then resell them
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.020]   when you're done with them?
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:53.020]   Instead of it being an expensive hobby
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:55.020]   it becomes either a cost to you
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:57.020]   or a good deal to you.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.020]   So you can be a cost neutral
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.020]   or maybe even a cost positive endeavor.
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.020]   Books, I've seen people do this with books
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.020]   that are into books.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.020]   Can you turn your hobbies into money?
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.020]   So if you are into something like scuba diving
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.020]   that's awesome
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:13.020]   it's a hobby
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.020]   could you become a part time instructor
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:17.020]   at the local scuba diving club?
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.020]   Well this would allow you to
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:21.020]   number one earn a little bit of extra income
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:23.020]   number two be around the scuba diving environment
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.020]   and number three
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:27.020]   be around the scuba diving environment
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:31.020]   and you would have opportunities to
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.020]   dive with your students
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.020]   where you're being paid to dive
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.020]   you'd also have opportunities to now where
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:39.020]   if the club has a boat
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:41.020]   I guarantee the instructors use the club property
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.020]   and are able to go out
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.020]   and do their own dives from time to time
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.020]   and they're able to use the club equipment
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.020]   without necessarily paying a fee for it
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.020]   each and every time.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:53.020]   So could you take a hobby like that
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:55.020]   and turn it into an income stream?
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:57.020]   You could probably do the same thing with hang gliding or flying
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.020]   I know a lot of people who are around aviation
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:01.020]   work as flight instructors
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:03.020]   and allows them to get time in the airplane
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:05.020]   and get paid for it
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.020]   or have discounts on services
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:09.020]   Could be worth pursuing
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.020]   Now those may not be your hobbies
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.020]   but is there some way that you could apply
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:15.020]   that same thought process
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.020]   to your own hobby?
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:19.020]   Could you buy something in bulk
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.020]   and then resell part of it?
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.020]   So I'm interested in getting some grass fed beef
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:25.020]   or some other kind of meat
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:27.020]   or some other kind of meat
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:29.020]   but in order to do that
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:31.020]   I kind of have to buy a whole cow
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:33.020]   So could I buy
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:35.020]   as a question I'm asking myself
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.020]   could I buy an entire cow
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:39.020]   turn around and distribute parts of it
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:41.020]   and charge people something
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:43.020]   for my time and effort of doing this
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.020]   and then wind up with a lower cost
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:47.020]   or maybe no cost
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:49.020]   for my share of the meat
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:51.020]   just simply by doing the work
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:53.020]   There are lots of things
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:55.020]   where people could maybe arrange something like this
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:57.020]   Buy something in bulk and then resell it
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:59.020]   and then at the expense of something completely
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.020]   So instead of
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:03.020]   can you store your stuff on craigslist
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:05.020]   is one of my favorite things
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:07.020]   I can't remember where I first heard that idea
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:09.020]   or maybe I made it up I have no idea
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.020]   but instead of paying for a storage unit
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:13.020]   which holds your stuff
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.020]   why don't you just sell your stuff
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.020]   have it on craigslist
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.020]   other people buy it
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:21.020]   and if you need it
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:23.020]   you go back on craigslist
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:25.020]   and you can find someone else selling the stuff
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.020]   right back to you
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.020]   so when you are traveling
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:31.020]   instead of having a big bag
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:33.020]   full of all the stuff you might need
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:35.020]   just take a little bag and buy it there
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:37.020]   if you actually need it
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:39.020]   you will save on baggage fees
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:41.020]   and just the straight up hassle
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:43.020]   Can you increase your skill
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.020]   when using something
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.020]   example would be
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:49.020]   if you have to have an expense
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:51.020]   could you learn to increase your skill
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.020]   with handling it
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:55.020]   could you learn when you are driving
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:57.020]   to drive more efficiently
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.020]   I have a video on youtube
[01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:01.020]   a really interesting video
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:03.020]   the video is called the mad max hyper mile
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.020]   everybody drives this big old pickup truck
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.020]   and gets 20-30 miles per gallon out of it
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:09.020]   now it is pretty extreme
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:11.020]   but remember we are studying the extreme
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:13.020]   to learn
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:15.020]   and to back up to what we can do today
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.020]   can you learn to
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.020]   if you are going to travel
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.020]   can you increase your travel skill
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.020]   and learn how to work through frequent flyer programs
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:25.020]   and get deals and discounts
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.020]   so use
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.020]   the expenses you already have
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   and pay for things efficiently
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.020]   can you take care of what you already have
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.020]   instead of replacing it
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.020]   even if you get something for free
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:39.020]   can you just take care of your stuff
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.020]   eliminate the expense of replacing something
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.020]   by being gentle with it
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.020]   is there an alternative to buying something
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.020]   can you rent instead of own
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:49.020]   if you need a pickup truck twice a year
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:51.020]   can you just rent one
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.020]   instead of going out and buying one
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:55.020]   if you enjoy going out on the boat a few times a year
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:57.020]   can you rent a boat
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:59.020]   or simply charter a boat
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:01.020]   if you once a year take an out of town road trip
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:03.020]   and you need a reliable car
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.020]   to take you across the country
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:07.020]   instead of an older car
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.020]   or a bigger car to take you across the country
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:11.020]   can you just rent one
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:13.020]   might be worth considering
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:15.020]   or flip it around
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:17.020]   can you own instead of rent
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:19.020]   so are there things you can do
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:21.020]   instead of leasing something
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:23.020]   can you buy it inexpensively
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.020]   instead of leasing your cable modem
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:27.020]   can you buy one
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.020]   or is it more cost effective to rent
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.020]   instead of own
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:33.020]   or is it more cost effective to own instead of rent
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:35.020]   can you carpool or can you share
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:37.020]   can you carpool on a ride
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.020]   can you share a ride
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:41.020]   can you share tools instead of buy them
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:43.020]   can you borrow your neighbors tools
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:45.020]   instead of going out and buying all your own
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:47.020]   in exchange you lend him the specialty tools
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:49.020]   that you have
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:51.020]   this can be applied in a library concept
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:53.020]   can you get your kids toys from the toy library
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:55.020]   instead of buying new toys
[01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:57.020]   you can buy them from the library
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:59.020]   you can get new toys for them every few months
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:01.020]   you can go to the toy library
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:03.020]   and swap out their toys
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:05.020]   if there is not one in your town start one
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.020]   start a tool library
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:09.020]   the library concept is such a great concept
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.020]   it can be applied in so many different areas
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:13.020]   if you need to borrow money
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.020]   borrow money in an intelligent manner
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:17.020]   borrow money in an intelligent manner
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:19.020]   borrow money in an intelligent manner
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:21.020]   so can you do intelligent financing
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.020]   so can you do intelligent financing
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:25.020]   most people
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:27.020]   many people when they go out and buy a house
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:29.020]   say I am going to take out a 30 year mortgage
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:31.020]   but what if a 30 year fixed rate mortgage
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.020]   isn't right for you
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:35.020]   and I am not saying it is or isn't
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:37.020]   just saying think about it
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.020]   so many times maybe it would be better for you
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:41.020]   to do something like a 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:43.020]   or a 7/1 arm
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:45.020]   most people don't stay in their houses
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:47.020]   for 30 years
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.020]   why overpay on interest
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.020]   for
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:53.020]   why overpay on interest
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:55.020]   for the first 5 or 7 or 10 years of a mortgage
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.020]   when you are not going to stay there for that long
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.020]   now you need to read the fine print
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.020]   you need to be careful
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:03.020]   rates may adjust for you
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:05.020]   but many people could save a substantial amount of money
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.020]   by pursuing a different financing strategy
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:09.020]   or if you are going to borrow on a fixed rate mortgage
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.020]   could you borrow on a 10 or 15 year mortgage
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.020]   instead of a 30 year mortgage
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:15.020]   there is a substantial spread
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:17.020]   in interest rates between 10 or 15 year mortgages
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:19.020]   and 30 year mortgages
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:21.020]   and the reason
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:23.020]   at least as far as my research
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:25.020]   has largely to do with the default rate
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:27.020]   people are much more likely to default on a 30 year mortgage
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:29.020]   than on a 10 or 15 year mortgage
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:31.020]   so because of that higher default rate
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:33.020]   the
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:35.020]   on 30 years
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:37.020]   that is built into the cost of the loan
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:39.020]   well if you are not going to default
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.020]   and if you can afford the payment
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:43.020]   shorten up the term of that loan
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:45.020]   and save yourself a substantial amount of interest
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.020]   if you need to borrow money
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.020]   can you do it with unsecured financing
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:51.020]   instead of secured debt
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:53.020]   so can you borrow
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:55.020]   off of something where for some reason
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:57.020]   something happened beyond your control
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:59.020]   and you weren't able to make the payments
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.020]   the debt is not secured by property
[01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:03.020]   it is unsecured credit card debt
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:05.020]   or unsecured personal loan
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:07.020]   instead of attached to a house
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.020]   or attached to a car
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.020]   that could be repossessed
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.020]   this would be an example
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:15.020]   just in a practical application
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.020]   I struggle sometimes to understand
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:19.020]   why people put additional debt onto their house
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.020]   through the form of a
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:23.020]   home equity loan or home equity line of credit
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.020]   instead of doing unsecured debt
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:27.020]   on a credit card
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.020]   there may be reasons to do both
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:31.020]   the house may have a better interest rate
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:33.020]   you may be able to borrow the money
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.020]   at more favorable terms
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.020]   but there also may be reasons to do it unsecured
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.020]   instead of secured
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.020]   can you get non-recourse loans
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:43.020]   instead of recourse loans
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:45.020]   where if you do default on it
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.020]   then if you do default on the loan
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.020]   the lender is not able to come after you
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:51.020]   for the balance
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:53.020]   can you be careful with your assets
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:55.020]   and make sure that you
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.020]   build wealth and assets
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.020]   that are taxable
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.020]   or that are judgement proof
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:03.020]   the state of Florida where I live
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:05.020]   has a very generous homestead exemption
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.020]   where if you were to be sued
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:09.020]   and were to be forced to declare bankruptcy
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.020]   you could
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:13.020]   retain the entire value of your house
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:15.020]   with no dollar limit
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.020]   as far as the value of that house
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:19.020]   so it would make a lot of sense
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.020]   to have a paid off home
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.020]   and borrow another property
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:25.020]   instead of on your personal home
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:27.020]   also IRA funds
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:29.020]   IRA funds generally
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.020]   IRA's and 401K's are generally
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:33.020]   protected in bankruptcy court
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:35.020]   so it wouldn't make sense to borrow against a 401K
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.020]   in many examples
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.020]   if you were worried about things like that
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:41.020]   now it may make sense if that's where you needed the money
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:43.020]   but consider it
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:45.020]   can you save for something
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:47.020]   so save money
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.020]   set up an automatic savings fund
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:51.020]   an emergency fund
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:53.020]   or a travel fund
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:55.020]   or a car maintenance fund
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:57.020]   or an insurance fund
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.020]   or a six month insurance
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:01.020]   or once a year
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.020]   and get the difference
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:05.020]   and then you set aside the money
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.020]   instead of doing it every month
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.020]   can you use other people's money
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.020]   other people's time
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:13.020]   or other people's resources
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:15.020]   instead of your own
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.020]   the real estate industry made the OPM words famous
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.020]   but it's still very very applicable
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:21.020]   so can you use
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:23.020]   and leverage somehow
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:25.020]   other people's money
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:27.020]   other people's time
[01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:29.020]   that's the whole point and nature of business
[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.020]   can you substitute other kinds of capital
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.020]   instead of financial capital
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.020]   so instead of spending money on something
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.020]   can you have social capital
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:39.020]   by the fact that you have a lot of friends
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:41.020]   you can borrow something from them
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:43.020]   that's social capital
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:45.020]   can you substitute knowledge
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:47.020]   so for example
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:49.020]   if you need a weed eater
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:51.020]   are you able to fix the weed eater
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.020]   for a friend of yours
[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:55.020]   and you borrow the weed eater
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:57.020]   and fix it and return it
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.020]   and you can use it for other things
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.020]   so think about how this can be applied
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:03.020]   to your situation
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.020]   look for ways
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.020]   for example student loans
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:09.020]   could you repay your student loans
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:11.020]   with some of the government debt forgiveness programs
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:13.020]   instead of paying it back yourself
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.020]   run the calculations on that kind of thing
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.020]   run the calculations
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.020]   and see if there are programs available for you
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.020]   if you have student loans
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.020]   can you work for their teaching programs
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.020]   their medical programs
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:27.020]   look for ways
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.020]   look to see if there is a program
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:31.020]   where instead of you paying back your student loans
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.020]   the government will forgive the debt for you
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.020]   I wish the program weren't there
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:37.020]   but it is so why don't you use it
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:39.020]   can you set something up
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:41.020]   where for example
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:43.020]   there is a website called youpromise
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:45.020]   where they will pay back your student loans
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.020]   with a percentage of your expenditures
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.020]   if you buy through their portal
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.020]   so can you buy things that you would buy anyway
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:53.020]   but buy them through youpromise
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:55.020]   and have them pay back your student loan
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.020]   based upon that rate
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:59.020]   can you start a business
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:01.020]   doing things you want to do anyway
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:03.020]   if you are into cars
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:05.020]   and you would be spending a lot of money
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:07.020]   start a car racing business
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.020]   and have the racing be your business
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.020]   excellent tax planning
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:13.020]   and also fun
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:15.020]   and you may make a bunch of money
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.020]   if you love to fish
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.020]   start a fishing charter
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.020]   or a fishing guide service
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.020]   be smart about where you place assets
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.020]   so if you have an expensive car
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.020]   and a personal car you should always put the expensive car
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:29.020]   where you can depreciate it as a business expense
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:31.020]   instead of into your personal world
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:35.020]   also the higher ongoing expenses
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:37.020]   could be paid for with deductible dollars
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:39.020]   instead of non-deductible dollars
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.020]   so consider where you place an asset
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:43.020]   be intelligent about it
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:45.020]   if there is a hobby that you are into
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:47.020]   why not start a business
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:49.020]   if you were a yoga fanatic
[01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:51.020]   or a piano teacher
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.020]   why not start a yoga business
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.020]   if you start a yoga business
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:57.020]   now your cost for your business
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:59.020]   training classes and your retreats
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:01.020]   now become a deductible business expense
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:03.020]   instead of a personal expense
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.020]   if you are into music
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:07.020]   start a band and record music
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:09.020]   now you can write off your band touring
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.020]   and your travel
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:13.020]   do you think the big recording artists
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.020]   pay for the cost of all of their travel expenses
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.020]   out of their personal checkbook
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:19.020]   absolutely not
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:21.020]   it comes out of the business checkbook
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:23.020]   so think about if you can do the same thing
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.020]   and if you are a yoga fanatic
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:27.020]   and you are a yoga fanatic
[01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.020]   there is no reason why
[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:31.020]   the rules are the same for you and for them
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.020]   run your band in a business like manner
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:37.020]   and it will help you
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:39.020]   a piano teacher can deduct the cost of a piano
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.020]   a performer can deduct the cost of getting to their performances
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:43.020]   so if you have skills and things like that
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:45.020]   consider how to leverage your skills and abilities
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.020]   and leverage the tax code
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.020]   can you find some kind of angle
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:51.020]   loophole or example
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:53.020]   that you can use to get to the next level
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:55.020]   or to get to the next level
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:57.020]   or to get to the next level
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:59.020]   what is your exception that you can exploit
[01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:01.020]   could you
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:03.020]   get someone to pay for your college education
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:05.020]   by working at the college
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:07.020]   can you work at a job that will reimburse you
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.020]   for college expenses
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.020]   or work at the school where you are studying
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:13.020]   that is super valuable
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:15.020]   can you work at your kids school
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.020]   instead of paying the tuition straight up
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:19.020]   or have your spouse work at your kids school
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:21.020]   could you play the system
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:23.020]   this example is not going to apply to everybody
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.020]   but I think it is
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:27.020]   it is a good example
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:29.020]   if you have kids that are going to college
[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:31.020]   let's say that you have some money
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:33.020]   one aspect of the college financial aid
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.020]   system right now
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:37.020]   is based upon your income
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.020]   so there is a form that is called a FAFSA
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:41.020]   free application for federal student aid
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:43.020]   that is a need based number
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:45.020]   that the government says
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:47.020]   disclose to us
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:49.020]   your financial situation
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.020]   and we will let you know
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:53.020]   how much money we think you should be able to
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:55.020]   to
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:57.020]   pay for your education
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:59.020]   and contribute towards your kids college
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:01.020]   if you are planning on taking some time off
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:03.020]   why not take a couple of years off
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.020]   take a little mini retirement
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:07.020]   travel with your kids
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.020]   do some work on a personal project
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:11.020]   drop your income down to extremely low level
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.020]   your kids will qualify for more financial aid
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.020]   based upon higher financial need
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:17.020]   I have never done this
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:19.020]   don't know all the rules on it
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.020]   but it seems like it could be an option
