[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 5. I'm your host, Josh Rascheetz.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   Today's show is somewhat pompously entitled, "The Ultimate Guide to Spending Money. How
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.720]   a Smart Person Can Optimize Each and Every Buying Decision to Get the Maximum Utility
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.780]   Out of Their Money." Now stick with me, I know that sounds a little bit pretentious
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.780]   and somewhat pompous, but the show is designed to be a comprehensive view of all the interesting
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.580]   ideas that I was able to come up with to get more value when you make a spending decision.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.200]   Essentially what the show is, I've sat down, I've brainstormed every way that I could come
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   up with to make smarter buying decisions. And hopefully by the end of the show, you'll
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.880]   have some ideas and some information that will be helpful to you. Now, as I start off
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   here, I just want to clarify. These are simply ideas, and it's possible that only one or
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.080]   two or three of them could ever be applicable to your life. I'm not assuming that any of
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.160]   them are applicable to your life. They're ideas that I think have value and can be applied
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   in a lot of different circumstances. So I also think that ideas, I personally love ideas.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:36.200]   I love ideas because ideas have a tendency, once you think of them and understand them,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.760]   to mate with each other and to get themselves in a situation where they pop out right at
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.400]   the time that you need one. So I may say something today about, I don't know, a smart way of
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.600]   buying socks and underwear, and a few years from now you may be buying a car and there
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.040]   may be an idea that's going to pop out to you. So that's okay.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   So today's show is going to be, again, an overview of all the different ideas I was
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.480]   able to come up with, interesting questions to ask yourself when you're buying something.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.640]   Now obviously these are a lot of questions. I'm not thinking that anybody would ever ask
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.640]   themselves all these questions, but think about them and apply them to different areas
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.440]   of your life. And at the end of the show we'll talk about that.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.160]   First though, before we get into the ideas, I want to get into the topic and the question
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   of frugality. Here's my question. When is it okay for you to spend a lot of money?
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Frugality is incredibly important. I'm not the frugality police, but frugality is incredibly
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:55.560]   important. It's important at the beginning stages of financial success when one is just
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   getting started putting together their financial plan, just getting started earning money,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.160]   making money and investing money. Every $10 you can invest at the beginning of your life
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   has a huge potential future result. So frugality is incredibly important then.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.120]   I would argue that frugality is important later on down the road because the people
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   who become wealthy are the ones who tend to practice these principles and they become
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.920]   a part of them. So frugality is important at every stage along life.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.040]   Question 1. When is it okay for you to spend a lot of money? I've got four answers to that
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.760]   question.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   Answer 1. Whenever you want to. I know it sounds a little bit unusual, but it's your
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.260]   money. You can do what you want to with it. So I'd say you can spend a lot of money whenever
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.480]   you want to because it satisfies something that's important to you. Some random guy on
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.920]   the internet, it's not my job to tell you what to do with your money. It's your money.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.520]   You earned it or it was given to you. You can do whatever you want with it. But obviously
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.960]   you're probably not here to hear me tell you that, but it is true.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   Answer 2. It's okay for you to spend a lot of money when you've considered the opportunity
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.260]   cost of your purchase. What are you giving up with your choice? To me opportunity cost
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.360]   is the key. Each of us has a finite amount of time. Each of us has a finite amount of
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.360]   resources. The things that we choose to do or not do with our time and with our resources
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.000]   are going to determine our choices. Excuse me, I guess our choices are what we're doing
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   when we choose. Each time we choose to do something ourselves, our opportunity cost
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.840]   is what we could have been doing with the time that we gave up to do it. Some people
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   might find a task like mowing the lawn and they may say I need to hire that out because
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.560]   it's more valuable to me to spend the money on mowing the lawn than it is to give up the
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.280]   time that I have for it. Now on the other hand, the opportunity cost is also financial.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.080]   So if you spend money on doing something, you're giving up what you could be doing with
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.720]   that money otherwise. And this entire show practically is talking at times about what
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.900]   those costs are. But if you've considered seriously the opportunity cost, what the alternative
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.840]   use of the dollar would be in your situation and you're satisfied with that, go for it.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   Then is it okay if you spend a lot of money? Answer three, I would suggest that if you're
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.720]   interested in being wealthy, it's okay to spend a lot of money when it's a small percentage
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   of your wealth. Rich people consistently spend only a small percentage of their wealth. That's
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.180]   why they got wealthy and that's why they stay wealthy. If you find someone that's spending
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.920]   a higher percentage of their, that's spending a lot more money than expresses a percentage
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.000]   of their wealth, I can promise you two things. Either number one, they're not wealthy and
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   they're just spending out of income. So they're high income earners and they're not high,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.480]   but they're not very wealthy. Or I can promise you it's because they're not going to stay
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.120]   wealthy long. There are plenty of stories you can go on the internet and read about
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   and there are plenty of stories of very wealthy people who became wealthy and then spent a
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.560]   lot because of foolish spending.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.360]   Let me give you an example. We often forget that rich people and wealthy people may actually
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.360]   be quite frugal because of the dollars involved. An example that came to me is the example
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.200]   of Paul Allen. Paul Allen was the co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, very wealthy
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.920]   man. For some reason, I don't know, he always sticks out in my head because of the yacht
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.480]   that he owns. Years ago I remember the yacht being in a lot of articles that I would read.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.680]   It's this huge, fancy, expensive yacht. So I went and looked it up because I was interested
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.040]   in the numbers on it.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.920]   So in 2003, Paul Allen bought a yacht named Octopus and this thing is incredible. It's
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.160]   an ocean liner. It's got a helicopter pad, it's got a couple of swimming pools. It's
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   huge. It's absolutely huge. He paid $200 million for it in 2003 and according to various news
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.240]   articles which I've read and I'll link to in the show notes, it costs him about $20
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.400]   million per year to run. So he paid $200 million for it, it cost him $20 million a year to
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.160]   run. Quite a lavish expense.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.280]   I don't know what Paul Allen was worth in 2003 but I looked up on celebrity net worth
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   and in 2013 as I record this, the website estimates his wealth to be about $15 billion.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:16.520]   I don't know if he was wealthier back then or less wealthy, it doesn't really matter.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.760]   Allen's worth $15 billion and he pays $200 million for a yacht that costs him $20 million
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.160]   per year to run.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.840]   Now, what I tried to do is I tried to make up an illustration and I don't know how
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.200]   much he earns. I have no idea what his return is on his investments, on his businesses.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.120]   I don't know if he works for earned income and has consulting projects. I don't know.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.280]   But if I just make up a number and I say that he's taking a 5% income level off of his
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   $15 billion portfolio, he has $750 million a year of income. $750 million a year of income.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   $750 million a year of income every year and it costs him $20 million per year to run his
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   boat.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.560]   So if you run some percentages on that, it's really interesting. So what I did was I ran
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   the percentages and I said what percentage of his net worth is caught tied up in that
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.440]   boat and the answer is 1.3%.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.560]   And I said what percentage of his net annual income does it cost him to run the boat and
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.700]   the answer is 2.6%.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   So the equivalent cost, let's break these down to smaller numbers. It costs him, if
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.920]   the equivalent cost of somebody who has a net worth of $2 million, so pretend you have
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   a net worth of $2 million and therefore at 5% using my same numbers earns $100,000 per
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.360]   year from their investments. It's like somebody in that situation going out and buying a boat
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   which has a price tag of $26,000 and spending $2,600 a year maintaining it. Not that big
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   of a deal now, huh?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.120]   To me, I would think that's actually quite reasonable. If somebody has a $2 million net
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.800]   worth, $100,000 a year of income from their investments, they want to buy a boat that
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   costs them $26,000 and then spend $2,600 a year operating it, go for it. That's a reasonable
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.980]   number. It's actually quite frugal number.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.720]   So my thought is make sure that your luxury spending or even your spending is a small
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   percentage of your wealth if possible if you care about wealth.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:47.400]   When you've seriously considered the best way to get the maximum utility out of your
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.080]   purchase and that's what this shows about. If you've really considered and thought about
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   the best way to get a deal and to stack on a lot of utility to each and every decision,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   it's fine. If you don't do that though, you find a lot of inefficiencies in your finances.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.000]   But if you'll do that, you can make excellent, very efficient buying decisions that will
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.320]   stand you in good step.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   So first some general tips. When you're making a buying decision, slow down. Most people's
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.800]   mistakes would, they would be able to coach themselves out of mistakes if they would slow
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.540]   down. Take time to research your choice. Think about your choice. Plan it out and consider
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:46.540]   the options. Research the alternatives that you could do. Think if this really meets your
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:53.640]   needs. Plan the purchase out. Management consultant Brian Tracy who I've thoroughly enjoyed over
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   the years listening to a lot of his audio and books, reading his books, has a rule which
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   he applies to making investment decisions. And his general rule is, I think it's a good
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   one. He says, "Spend as much time investigating the investment as you spend earning the money
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   that you're thinking of investing." I really don't think that that's ultimately possible.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   At the end of the day, it's not really possible to spend as much time investigating something
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.600]   as it takes you to earn the money. But it's a good, I think it's a step in the right direction.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.280]   If you're going to make a $10 decision, make it quickly. That's fine if it doesn't take
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.520]   you that long to earn $10. If you're going to make a $100 decision, slow down. If you're
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   going to make a $1,000 decision, do it even slower. $100,000 decision, make sure you take
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.360]   lots of time considering that decision, considering all of your options, considering everything
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   that you can do to really make a quality decision. If you're going to buy something, buy it smart.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:13.920]   Develop your buying skill. There's an incredible world of abundance available for those who
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   know the tips and techniques about buying and who've developed methods of paying for
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:31.160]   things in such a way that they get more use for their dollar. There's a world of scarcity
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.600]   for those who run out, plunk down a credit card and pay retail.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.800]   So when you're making a buying decision, consider your method of payment to get maximum value.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.560]   Here's some ideas that I came up with. Number one, can you pay cash and get a discount instead
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.080]   of paying with a card? So when working with private individuals, sometimes ask yourself
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.800]   the question, "Can I pay cash?" Cash often, in the right circumstance, speaks louder than
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   plastic does. So if you're buying a car from an individual on the side of the road, it's
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   very possible that a few stacks of hundred dollar bills will get you a better deal than
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:21.400]   a credit card swipe or a bank check. It's also possible that sometimes with services,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   if you're hiring services from a tradesperson, you may ask if you can get yourself a cash
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.600]   discount of some kind or if you're in a store. Just ask.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   Now the flip side of this, can you pay with some kind of rewards credit card instead of
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.760]   cash or a debit card in order to get more value for yourself? So if you walk into your
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.500]   local big box store, it's very unlikely that you're going to be able to negotiate a cash
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:54.500]   discount. So why pay cash? Why not pay with some sort of paying mechanism that allows
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   you to get a discount on the services with either rewards points or mileage programs
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.880]   or just a cash, straight cash back return? I would love it if all stores offered cash
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.960]   discounts, but until they do, why not look out for yourself?
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.680]   Could you pay with a credit card instead of a debit card in order to get better consumer
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   protection? So anytime you're buying electronics or something like that, strongly consider
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:33.000]   paying for those services with something like an American Express or some kind of platinum
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   credit card. American Express has a fairly generous warranty program that would save
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   you money if you simply paid with that instead of a store warranty. They have a very strong
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.520]   return policy. So if the equipment breaks or you simply want to take it back, you take
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.560]   it right back. So things like that, if you pay with a credit card versus a debit card
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   and that credit card has better protections for it, that may bring you out ahead. It could
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.320]   also be smart to use a credit card instead of a debit card or cash or a check in a transaction
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:17.320]   where you're not quite sure what's ultimately going to happen. So assume that you're having
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.080]   a contractor work on your home or a service provider. It may be a useful way of protecting
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:29.560]   yourself to pay with a credit card if possible so that you'd have the ability to reverse
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:36.140]   the transaction if the work weren't done properly. So on a credit card, when you buy and spend
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.280]   money on a credit card, it's extremely easy to do a chargeback. A lot harder though if
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.360]   you've paid cash or a check to ever get the money back. If you're paying cash back, forget
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.000]   it. If you're paying with cash, forget it. You're never getting the money back. But with
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.280]   a credit card, you've always got a hook in the money where according to the terms of
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.360]   the card issuer, you can do a chargeback and get the money back. So consider that. That
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   may be a valuable way to protect yourself. I would seriously consider that if I were
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.240]   having a service provider or a contractor do work for me. Could you pay with a debit
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.600]   card instead of a credit card so that you feel the expense more emotionally and that
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   you don't overspend? Many times people get upset at credit cards in the popular financial
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:33.760]   press because they feel that spending money with credit cards causes you to spend more
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.760]   money. I've seen this go both ways and it depends on who you are as a person. For some
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:48.160]   people, spending money on a credit card is thoughtless and it's easy for them. So if
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:55.160]   they could switch to spending with cash or with a debit card, they would feel the money
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:02.720]   a lot more. They would feel the money leaving their hands. On the flip side, some people
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.120]   just feel very, very careful about credit card purchases and debit card purchases because
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.440]   they show up on their tracking software if they track their expenditures and cash just
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.760]   seems to float out of their life. Consider what your spending habits are and consider
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.000]   what the best way to do it is. But many times people could be served by paying with a debit
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   card or cash instead of a credit card so that the expenses felt a little bit more fully.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.760]   There is good research on this. I looked for the actual source studies and I couldn't find
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.960]   them. Commonly, you'll find if you go on the internet and start researching this subject,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.040]   you'll find a Dun and Bradstreet survey which says that people spend a significantly higher
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.080]   amount on credit cards than debit cards. I looked for the original study. I couldn't
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   find it so I can't prove that but hey, the interweb says it's out there so let's assume
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:05.600]   it is. You also find fast food restaurants are often quoted that evidently some of the
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.480]   major fast food players, their average purchase size significantly went up when they started
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   accepting plastic instead of cash for transactions. That's why you can go to a fast food restaurant
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.400]   and there's no minimum purchase of a certain amount. You can just pay for the purchase
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.920]   using plastic. Now another question, could you pay with cash in order to have greater
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   purchase privacy? So if you pay with plastic, whatever it is that you're purchasing is always
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:44.560]   on your record. It's always available. Would it be wise for you to consider paying with
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   cash in order to have an anonymous form of payment? I actually personally see more and
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:01.080]   more societies moving towards a cashless society in Europe. I can't remember, I was reading
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.320]   an article some months ago about one of the countries in Europe, maybe Denmark, that is
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   very close to that, in that direction. I don't think it was Denmark. Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:21.520]   But this really concerns me because there should be a certain amount of anonymity with
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   your purchases and cash is what gets you that. You're going to find in the future, the systems,
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.520]   my personal opinion, you're going to find that the systems are going to move more in
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.920]   the direction of electronic transactions as part of the overreaching growth of government
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.840]   and the more consistent tracking. I'm not upset about it, it's just a fact of life.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   So realize that just like through over the last few months with the NSA release of Edward
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:21:02.200]   Snowden of the information of what the US government tracks and many European governments,
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.380]   realize that every single buying decision that you make, every product or service that
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:14.380]   you pay for is tracked and there's a record of it. And so is every email that you send
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:21.500]   and so is every phone call. So when you start stacking those things together, there's a
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:28.500]   pretty compelling list of purchases that can be made.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:35.660]   Was recently, just last night I was reading the discovery documents which I found online
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.700]   from the Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman case. And it's very interesting as part of
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.660]   the discovery documents that the attorneys were using, some of the documents were all
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.660]   of Trayvon Martin's cell phone records. Now these weren't admitted, the judge didn't allow
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:55.940]   these to be admitted in the court case. But I was reading, posted online every single
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:02.940]   text message that Trayvon Martin sent. It's freely available. Realize that every single
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.300]   dollar that he spent was tracked as well. So consider, which should you pay with cash
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.940]   for greater purchase privacy? One little tip for you, if you need cash, you can always
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.340]   get cash out of the bank, you can always do ATMs, things like that. If you ever need anonymous
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.620]   cash, the best way that I know to do that is simply to do cash back transactions when
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.260]   you're at a store. So if you're at a grocery store or a home improvement store or something
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.820]   like that, swipe your debit card and then get extra cash back on the side. Probably
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.300]   a little bit more of a private way of getting cash out than going to the ATM every day.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.380]   You've got stricter limits of course, but just pass that along in case you ever need
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:47.820]   that. Next question, can you barter for the service or the item instead of using currency
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:54.820]   for it? So instead of paying with money, could you pay with something else? Could you trade
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:02.060]   something? Could you swap something? Could you trade services or an alternative product?
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.740]   I always enjoy going on Craigslist, on Craigslist they always have the trade section, I can't
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:14.580]   remember what it's called, but they have the trading section. Do you have an old object
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.300]   sitting in your yard that you don't want or need anymore that you'd be willing to trade
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:25.220]   for someone else's object B that's sitting in their yard? You could join a barter network.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:31.660]   So there are a lot of barter networks that are available. This could especially be something
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:38.660]   for businesses. When you're setting up a business and you're building out, could you join a
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.220]   local barter or trade network and do business there? A couple of advantages, number one,
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:51.220]   this lowers your outgoing flow of currency, which is helpful when you're starting a business.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:58.300]   It also allows you to have access to a specific market and specific customers. So by joining
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.180]   a barter network you're automatically going to be part of that network's customers. And
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:09.300]   if you're the first person in your occupation or if you're a very small pool of occupations
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.900]   that can be extremely helpful. There are a lot of alternative barter currencies available.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.900]   Famous ones such as the Ithaca dollar I think is up in Ithaca, New York. It was started
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   back at least 20 years ago now that the Ithaca dollar has been operating as a small local
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:36.060]   form of time banking. There are barter currencies that work in gold and silver. One I'm familiar
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:43.460]   with which I'll link to in the show notes is the American Open Currency Standard where
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.460]   it's a system of a barter network where the barter is done with gold and silver and copper
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:54.460]   coins which are assigned a token face value and that allows trade to be done within the
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:01.740]   network using the gold and silver coins as a commodity. There are online currencies such
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:10.620]   as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most famous but there are plenty of online currencies. There's
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:17.620]   a dozen or two. And consider also that online currencies go that are transferable between
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:24.200]   national currencies so you can transfer between Bitcoins and US dollars. There are also online
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.480]   currencies that exist purely in the online world just like there are currencies that
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   exist purely without any exchange to dollars in the physical world. Be careful with tax
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:43.820]   issues. Barter income is not tax free. I found some interesting information on the IRS website
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:51.900]   that actually talks through the tax guidance for it. Basically it's treated just like any
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.300]   other dollar transaction. If you realize a profit then you need to declare that profit
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   and exchange that profit and pay income tax on that profit. Obviously I would imagine
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:11.300]   that it would depend on the transaction and depend on the business as far as how that's
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:18.140]   actually conducted. But be careful. Bartering is not simply tax free but it is an option.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:24.340]   Does save you money if there's a lower outflow of cash out of your pocket. Now obviously
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:31.340]   I enjoy the barter currencies and the time banking concepts but reality is that even
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.460]   things like babysitting is probably where this is more practical. Do you have kids?
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:41.300]   Do you pay for babysitting? Just swap babysitting services with another family. That could help
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.220]   save a tremendous amount of money. Maybe instead of doing date night every week you do it every
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:50.340]   other week and one of your date nights is taking care of some of your other family friends
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.540]   kids so that they can go out. Things like that can have a tremendous impact as far as
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:02.540]   the dollars saved and they're fairly easy changes to make. Buy with the lowest price
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.620]   and with the lowest cost. Always consider in making a buying decision price and cost.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:16.140]   Now they're not the same thing and you have to consider them both. So the way I define
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.820]   it price is what you pay up front. Price is just simply the number that's listed on the
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:27.820]   price tag. Cost is what the item or the service costs you over its lifetime. It may have a
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:36.020]   very low up front cost and a higher ongoing, it may have a low up front cost and low ongoing
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.300]   expenses or it may have a low up front cost and higher ongoing expenses. The example that
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.540]   probably many of us have experienced would be something like buying inkjet printers.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:54.540]   Inkjet printers have an extremely low price and they have a ridiculously awful cost. So
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:02.580]   the printer is basically subsidized by the company that's producing it and many printers
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:09.580]   require you to use their company's cartridges to fill it. So consider both the price and
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:18.980]   the cost and consider, try to calculate what those numbers are going to be. And in some
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.460]   situations it may be right for you to buy the lowest price and in some situations it
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:33.180]   may be right for you to buy the lowest cost. But consider them.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:38.260]   One of the first things that I and probably many of you often look for is can you buy
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:45.260]   an item online instead of in a store? Online shopping has been an incredible help to the
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:52.820]   consumer in general. First you could save on sales tax currently that's in the process
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:59.820]   of changing in the US but I live in the state of Florida which has a standard 6% sales tax.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.540]   If I can buy a product online from a store that's not going to charge me sales tax that's
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   an automatic 6% discount. That's substantial. You can get a lower price sometimes because
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:17.860]   the company has lower costs. So if you are a retailer and you're required to maintain
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.660]   a number of physical locations that comes with a high expense and that high expense
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   needs to be built into the product price. But sometimes an online store will often just
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:42.780]   have a lower price because lower internal costs. Also greater selection. So if you're
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:48.260]   shopping for pet supplies chances are you're going to find a substantially higher selection
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:54.620]   from an online pet company, pet store company than you are from the local grocery store
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:30:01.140]   where you buy your groceries. So sometimes just simply by the greater selection you're
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.900]   going to be able to save money. And the selection comes partly because the company doesn't have
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.560]   to display the products. They can have loads and loads of products that just simply sit
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.820]   on a warehouse shelf. They don't have to be displayed in a beautiful store where you
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.260]   can see them all individually. So consider, can you buy something online instead of in
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:25.260]   a store? Can you buy something used and still good? Many people often jump straight to buying
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:33.500]   something used. Many people don't. Stores like Goodwill, thrift stores, yard sales obviously
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:43.420]   are some people's secret source of great items. But I have a great near-multi-million dollar
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.740]   store near my house. They've got a great Goodwill location that's just very close by. Anytime
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:55.140]   I need something I often check there first. Wine glasses would be an example. I've been
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.020]   buying wine glasses little by little. I go down there and many of them I don't like but
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:04.260]   there's lots of really fancy nice ones there. I pick them up for a buck each. That's pure
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.460]   profit for Goodwill which they have their own business model of helping out people to
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:17.460]   build employment skills. But it's also a good deal for me. Dog bowls. My wife and I bought
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:24.100]   some dog bowls there at the Goodwill store for our puppies to eat out of. A buck each
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:29.260]   versus the six or seven, sorry it was a buck for two versus the six or seven dollars at
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:35.580]   the local pet store. So consider, can you buy something used but still good? Can you
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:42.580]   buy something on sale? So another example would be always looking and buying off of
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:50.140]   sale prices. One thing I do is when I shop for groceries, we generally shop for groceries
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:58.900]   based upon what's on sale and then simply learn to use what we bought. So instead of
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.580]   saying going to the store with a list of here are the vegetables that I want to buy today,
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.860]   we simply say what are the vegetables that are on sale, let's buy those and then let's
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:14.420]   figure out how to make menus out of them. When you start doing that type of thing consistently,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   lot of savings there. So look for things that are on sale. Plan ahead for specific sales.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.340]   If you know that there's something that you're going to buy, back to taking the time to think
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:31.180]   about it, a lot of times there are specific sales that are offered on a seasonal basis.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:38.180]   I've for a long time preferred to wear Brooks Brothers non-iron shirts. Those were my thing
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.940]   for a long time. Brooks Brothers has a sale basically twice a year when those shirts would
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:49.940]   go on sale. If I would plan ahead and buy those shirts when they're on sale, then there
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:56.980]   would be a substantial discount. I've read about the Berkshire Hathaway discounts. Berkshire
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.220]   Hathaway is Warren Buffet's company. He owns dozens of companies in the umbrella of his
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   parent company. Every year they have the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. During annual meeting,
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:16.740]   many of the products from many of the stores go on sale. So if I were living in the Midwest
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.860]   where Nebraska Furniture Mart, which is one of the companies that Berkshire Hathaway owns,
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.540]   if I were living there and I were going to do my furniture shopping, I'd be pretty sure
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:33.060]   to wait for that Berkshire Hathaway sale and figure out how to get a discount on it because
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:40.060]   of that timing. So if you plan ahead, oftentimes things go on sale at times when...if you plan
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.920]   ahead and are able to buy them, you can get them when they're on sale. Consider things
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.300]   like travel. There's always seasons of travel. There's the high season and the low season
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   and then they have what they call the shoulder season. So if you're going to go to...well,
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:05.540]   each destination would be different, but look into the prices of where you're going and
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.060]   see if maybe you can travel in the shoulder season. So instead of going skiing in the
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:15.180]   most popular week, and I'm not sure when that is, a lot of times there's a couple of weeks
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.100]   in between the most popular weeks around the holidays or spring break that the prices would
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:26.620]   be substantially decreased. So just think, can you buy something on sale? Could you become
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:33.620]   a shareholder or a member in the company? One interesting aspect on the Berkshire Hathaway
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:41.180]   conversation, when I was reading Warren Buffett's most recent annual report, I learned that
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:46.580]   you can get a discount on your car insurance if you're a GEICO member if you are a Berkshire
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:51.900]   Hathaway shareholder. Now GEICO is...my insurance is not with them. I have no idea if they're
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:58.220]   a good company or not, but they advertise themselves as having substantially low prices.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.940]   So if somebody has substantially low prices and if you call them up and tell them you're
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.420]   a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder, you can get an additional shareholder discount. Now
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.660]   I don't know if you have to buy the shares that are Class A Berkshire Hathaway shares
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   that are $100,000 plus. I don't know as of the time of the recording, $150,000, $180,000
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.720]   a share. But maybe you can buy some of the fractional shares that are available in other
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.540]   classes or other forms of ownership. But I've got no idea. But the point is research it
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:35.260]   and see if there's some sort of discount that you can get by becoming a shareholder or a
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   member. I'm a member of USAA for my car insurance. So as a member of USAA, I'm entitled to a
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:48.300]   dividend back. And basically, we'll talk about that in a minute. But that allows me
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.660]   to have my specific costs or whatever the actual company's costs are. It saves me a
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:59.380]   substantial amount of money for great car insurance and great service. Can you buy something
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:06.380]   that goes up in value instead of going down? Is there something where if you changed which
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:13.140]   option you were buying, it would go up in value in the long run instead of down? So
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:20.140]   the example that came to me for this one is fancy wooden furniture versus cheaper furniture.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.700]   Tom Stanley's book Millionaire Next Door, he talked about that millionaires' houses
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:31.700]   are more likely to be decorated or furnished with high quality wooden furniture. I thought
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.540]   that was really interesting. I've read various articles over the years. I'll link to one
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.820]   in the show notes by Joshua Cannon about luxury furniture. I don't own any luxury furniture.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.220]   I never have and maybe who knows, maybe I will in the future. But I was fascinated to
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.100]   find that there are brands of furniture out there which if you buy them and you buy them
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.020]   right and you buy them well, will actually increase their value over time. Generally,
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:07.020]   they have at least a good past track record of doing so. So it might be worth considering.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:15.700]   Could you spend more money up front, buy furniture that's likely to keep its value and then
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:23.340]   when you go to sell it in the future, instead of losing money on it, you wind up making
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   money on it? So if I were going to go for some middle of the road furnishings or I were
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.260]   going to go for some high end, I would consider going the high end if you had the cash to
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:40.500]   do it. Another example, if you have money, you can do this in a lot of different areas
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.260]   of life. I don't know anything about watches. I'm not a watch guy but I would imagine
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:52.260]   if you buy a well-known brand that has a history and has an audience, you can watch the watches
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:59.260]   and you can wear that luxury timepiece for potentially decades and then if you decide
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:04.260]   to sell it, it's possible that if you buy it properly and you know what you're doing,
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:10.020]   it's possible that that timepiece may actually appreciate in value. My understanding, I know
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   Rolex is not one of the highest brands but it's one that most consumers recognize. My
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:22.820]   understanding is a 1980 Rolex is going to cost you a substantially similar amount to
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:29.820]   a 2013 Rolex. So that would be something to consider. Now the flip side is can you buy
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:35.180]   something super cheap that simply does the job instead of going middle of the road? So
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:40.740]   back to my furniture example, I would imagine that the worst place to be as far as financially
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.980]   is middle of the road furniture like you get from Target or from, I don't know, insert
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:52.780]   local furniture store of your choice. That furniture is going to be nicer furniture but
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.980]   it's probably not going to have a high resale value. So you could go on the high end and
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.220]   buy expensive furniture that's going to retain its value or you could go on the very low
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:09.220]   end. Ikea is very trendy, has a very low purchase acquisition cost so can that do the job for
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:15.780]   you? Now is it going to be cheap, more cheaply made? Absolutely. But maybe in your situation
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:22.340]   that fills the needs. So think about can you go to the very high end and get a product
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.340]   that retains its value or can you go extremely cheap on the very low end, something that
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.900]   does the job instead of going with the middle of the road product that does the job maybe
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.420]   a little bit better but it's going to lose all of its value. Can you buy something that
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:43.420]   has a high resale value? So this is back to cost. Consider the resale value of a purchase.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:48.580]   My wife and I are expecting our first baby and as part of that, this may surprise you
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.020]   and I hope it doesn't gross you out but it's been really interesting. As part of that we're
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:58.740]   planning on if possible using cloth diapers instead of disposable plastic diapers. A number
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:04.620]   of reasons for that, I won't get into all of them right now. Partly the health concerns
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:11.020]   of disposable diapers but partly the cost, that's not the full thing, there are a lot
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:16.740]   of other factors than that, mainly the health concerns. But it's interesting if you actually
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:23.740]   look at the cost. I never would have imagined the resale value that exists with cloth diapers.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:31.340]   A cloth diaper, one of the fancier brands that you buy is about 20 bucks each for a
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:37.100]   new one. The way they work and I won't get into all the different options and what not,
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:42.500]   you can do your own research. But about 20 bucks each. Go on eBay, you'll find them selling
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   every day, used diapers for 10 to 12 bucks each. I was surprised too. It's not the kind
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:56.020]   of thing that usually you consider as having a high resale value but these brands really
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:02.000]   do. They really do have a tremendously high resale value. So you could, if you were doing
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.420]   an analysis on something like that, you could buy brand new, well run cloth diapers, use
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.740]   them for a child or two, turn around and at least in the current market, resell them for
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:19.740]   a substantial amount of money. So your amortized cost ends up being quite low. Now what we've
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.460]   done is buy them used at a lower cost than the 10 or 12 dollars by being very selective
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:30.000]   about that and who knows, maybe we'll make a profit on them, I don't know. But most people
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.260]   probably don't want to talk about cloth diapers but I just was fascinated by seeing this little
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:40.840]   quirk in the marketplace that I wouldn't have expected. Another example would be something
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.060]   like cars. So consider the lifetime cost of the car. Are you buying a car that has a high
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:53.060]   resale value? Now if you're buying something new, this would be very important. So if I
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:59.940]   were buying a car, a new car, I would strongly consider buying maybe a Honda or a Toyota
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.900]   or another brand that's known for having a higher resale value versus buying something
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:11.220]   like a Kia or a Hyundai. I would try to exploit that and try to make sure that I had a car
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.820]   with a high resale value if I were buying it new. Now if I were buying it used, I would
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.340]   consider the quality and I would probably consider strongly buying the car with a lower
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:28.020]   resale value. I recently bought a Hyundai minivan. What I learned when kind of shopping
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:35.020]   the market for minivans was that the Hyundai was several thousand dollars cheaper than
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:42.540]   the Toyota and the Honda were and I found that the quality ratings were substantially
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:48.180]   similar. I couldn't find any evidence that would show me that the quality of the Hyundai
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:53.820]   or the Kia minivan was anything really remarkably less than the Honda or the Toyota. So I just
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:59.220]   went ahead and bought the cheaper brand that had the lower resale value and saved the money.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.740]   But consider that in your buying decisions. Could you buy something just as good that's
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:10.380]   cheaper? So could you go with a store brand? I'd purchase the Target store brand razors
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:17.380]   instead of what I used to buy which was the Gillette Mach 3. The razor companies have
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:22.900]   a very high opinion of their product in my opinion and charge a substantial amount. Well,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:27.180]   I'd like to save money and so I started trying some of the different options and I found
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:34.180]   that the Target brand razors were delivered as good of a shave as the more expensive Gillette
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:41.460]   Mach 3 did. I didn't sacrifice anything and I saved a substantial amount of money. Store
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:48.460]   brand groceries versus name brand. More and more across the country, store brands are
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:54.820]   incredible quality. If you're not one who shops store brands, try them. The reason that
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.740]   they're cheaper is because the store brand doesn't generally have all of the...it's often
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.500]   the same product, just packaged differently and the store brand doesn't have all of the
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.460]   advertising costs that the large packaged good companies have to get you to buy their
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:15.460]   product. Try it. Substantial savings sometimes. We find that in shopping for canned goods,
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:23.700]   my wife and I find that buying the store brand is almost always cheaper still than buying
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:31.260]   the name brand option when it's on sale. So instead of having to wait for a sale, like
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.540]   I said earlier with waiting for sales, we just simply buy the store brand. Can you buy
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:42.540]   something with lower ongoing taxes and fees? So consider the lifetime costs here of taxes
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:48.800]   and fees. One interesting thing, again I live in the state of Florida, if you have a boat
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:54.020]   in the state of Florida that has a hull that's older than 30 years, the state of Florida
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:59.420]   considers that to be an antique boat and doesn't charge you annual registration fees. I didn't
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.780]   know that until I was talking to someone who told me that, but I thought that was fascinating.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:10.020]   Now that's a 30 year old boat, but you know what? There are a lot of great hulls out there
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:14.980]   that are from decades ago. In fact, many times the person who was telling me about that had
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:21.260]   a sailboat. That sailboat had a substantially lower, the sailboat was a great hull from
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:26.980]   years and years ago, but they simply made sure to choose one that was 30 years old plus
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:32.860]   and had no annual registration fees, no annual taxes. I thought that was powerful. Now I
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.660]   don't know if they do the same thing with antique cars, that would be cool, because
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:43.660]   if it were antique cars, you could stack buying the car at a discounted price, potentially
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:51.460]   buying one that could appreciate in value and have low ongoing registration fees as
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.620]   well. So that would be a good, now I don't know if that's the case or not, it would be
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.860]   interesting to study, but it is there with boats. So consider, is there something like
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   that in your area? Research it. Are there any special tax credits available? So if you're
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:13.820]   buying a car, a hybrid, are there any hybrid renewable energy credits available? If you're
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:19.740]   buying an air conditioner, are there any kind of renewable energy credits, efficiency credits,
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.540]   things like that that are available to you? A few years ago there was the first time home
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:29.460]   buyer credit, which was an $8,000, if my memory is correct, a $8,000 government contribution
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.580]   towards the purchase of your new home. If you were planning on buying a new home, as
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:38.100]   long as, maybe the price is inflated by that amount because everybody was doing it, but
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:42.860]   if you were planning on buying a new home, that was a substantial amount of money that
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:49.860]   you could consider pursuing. So always research and see if there are some tax credits available.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:58.060]   Interestingly, the tax credits, you kind of have to always study those for yourself, and
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:05.060]   that's one that's going to come into play if you're usually on the front end of a wave
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:11.420]   of people making similar decisions. The government generally uses tax credits to try to encourage
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:17.780]   or discourage certain behaviors. So when there were tax credits available for hybrid cars,
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:24.780]   it was only for a certain number of vehicles sold under that type of model. So you've got
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:31.620]   to be an early adopter, but that can help lower your cost. Research it. Can you get
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:37.260]   the best deal by checking out the competition? Try some sort of competition site or application
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:44.260]   for your computer or for your phone. There are a lot of versions of this available. Online
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:51.680]   shopping sites like Price Grabber, Google Shopping. When you're on your phone, sites
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:57.460]   like Shop Savvy or Amazon Price Check, these are wonderful. If you're sitting in a store,
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:03.340]   a local retail store, pull out your phone, pull up an application like Shop Savvy or
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:09.820]   Amazon Price Check, scan the barcode, and see what's available online. You may still,
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.300]   or at other stores, you may still choose to buy it right there, but it's at least good
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:19.380]   to know that information. If you're buying things online, there are a lot of short-term
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:25.140]   deal websites. Check out Brad's Deals, Woot, DoD Tracker, Deal of the Day Tracker, Giveaway
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.820]   of the Day, and One Sale a Day. All these are in the show notes for you to reference.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:34.860]   If you're not familiar with some of them, check these sites out. If you're trying to
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.660]   get a good price on something and you're not sure if it's a good price or if it's a good
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:45.660]   option, use a site like Decide.com, Huckster, Deal News, and Invisible Hand. These sites
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:51.780]   will give you a listing. Then they'll say, "Yes, this is a good deal. Go ahead and buy,"
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:58.180]   or they'll say, "You should wait." This is really worth considering. There are the daily
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:03.300]   deal sites like Groupon, Living Social, and there are a bunch of other ones as well. Those
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.540]   are the well-known ones. Be careful. Oftentimes, you may wind up buying stuff you didn't know
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:13.580]   that you were going to need, but if you need something, that might be a consideration for
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:19.340]   you to do. I've linked to a couple of resources. Clark Howard, the radio broadcaster, his team
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.580]   keeps a really great list of these deal of the day and coupon sites updated. I've linked
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:29.380]   to that in the show notes. He also keeps a really great list called his Free and Cheap
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:36.380]   List, which is along this same vein. I think it's really interesting to investigate.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:42.380]   Can you find a coupon code before you check out? Anytime you're checking out online, just
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:47.140]   Google "company name coupon code" before you check out and see what pops up. It'll take
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.700]   you to sites like RetailMeNot. You'll be able to look and see if there's just a quick and
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:57.180]   easy way to save 10% or get free shipping. Almost every single time that I buy something
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.980]   online, I can usually find something like that. It takes about two minutes to find a
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:07.100]   coupon code. It saves a substantial amount of money and it builds up over time.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:14.100]   Can you get a lower lifetime cost by paying more up front? Back to the idea of can you
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:22.660]   pay for a higher product that has a lower lifetime cost? My wife and I use Brita water
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:29.060]   filters in our house, considering switching to a type of water filter called a Berkey.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:34.900]   I think it costs a couple hundred bucks to buy new, but the lifetime cost of it is substantially
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:41.060]   lower than the Brita filters that we use. So each gallon of water, once you make that
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:47.860]   additional cost, is an extremely low price versus a very high price using the Brita filters.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:52.300]   Now you have to have the money to do it up front, but consider, it could be worth it.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:56.180]   Could you use something like a straight razor instead of disposable? I have a friend who
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.700]   swears by his straight razor. This is the straight razor, the thing that looks like
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:06.500]   you're going to slash your throat at any time. But you know what? It may be a substantial
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.740]   investment to get a good straight razor, but once you have it, that's the type of thing
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:17.740]   that is a lifetime purchase. So consider the cost of disposable options.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:24.540]   Could you get a lower lifetime cost by using a reusable solution instead of a disposable?
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:31.540]   Other examples would be, I always chuckle when I see them advertise the Swiffer mops.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:36.700]   What's wrong with a mop in a bucket of water? Well, the Swiffer, you've got to buy the new
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:43.020]   little sheets for it, and you've got to buy the new little, I don't know, the accessories
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:49.700]   that go with it. A mop, you don't. A mop is a one-time purchase. Could you use a dishrag
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:56.700]   instead of paper towels to wipe up your messes? Paper towels, disposable, ongoing cost. Dishrag,
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:01.020]   one-time cost plus laundry cost, which is negligible.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:06.260]   Can you get the best deal by bundling or by unbundling? So investigate the options that
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:11.260]   are available. Try, calculate what the triple play will cost you from utility providers.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:16.460]   Do the math. Did a whole podcast, obviously, on save money on cell phones. The general
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:23.460]   consensus that IPDaily and I came out with on that is you're usually better by unbundling,
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.820]   but run the math. You never know.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:32.940]   Can you buy from a warehouse club or join a co-op of some sort? Costco, Sam's Club.
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:39.940]   Costco's maximum markup on their items is 14%. That's not that much. I don't know what
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:47.340]   Sam's Club is, but it's probably similar to that. If you're buying a lot of items, that
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:54.180]   may save you some money and it can be a really good option for you.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:59.020]   One of my favorites is can you buy wholesale instead of retail by becoming a distributor
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:05.660]   or a dealer? If there's something that you buy on an ongoing basis that's a consumable
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:10.900]   item, investigate to see whether you can become a distributor or a dealer of that item.
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:17.500]   I have a friend of mine who enjoys smoking cigars and ran a retail store. What he did
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:24.500]   is he signed up to become a cigar dealer. Basically, all you need is what's called an
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:30.340]   EIN, an employer identification number, and you can become a dealer. So he bought all
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:37.060]   of his cigars, large numbers for his personal collection, he simply bought them at largely
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:42.380]   wholesale prices, which is a substantial discount from what you pay at the local cigar store.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:47.500]   He was able to accumulate a nice collection, would give them to his customers and friends,
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.580]   and buy them at wholesale instead of retail.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:57.100]   I'll link to an article where online Joshua Kennan writes about how to do this. He became
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:03.260]   a wholesale rose dealer. He loves getting roses on an ongoing basis. He simply set up
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:08.700]   a company and had one of the wholesale companies ship him the roses at a substantially reduced
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.180]   cost. So consider that. There are so many options available. If there's something that
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:19.220]   you buy on an ongoing basis that's consumable, usually, it's going to be the better option.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:23.340]   Think about how you can buy it wholesale instead of retail by simply becoming a distributor
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:27.860]   or a dealer. A little bit of paperwork will save you a lot of money.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:34.780]   Research discount programs that are available to you. I'm a USAA member. USAA has discounts
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:41.780]   on car buying and things like that. Mercedes-Benz. Could you become a Mercedes-Benz owner's club
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:48.240]   before you buy a new Mercedes-Benz? I really enjoyed, which I'll profile some of the ideas
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.340]   maybe in the future. Brad Wilson wrote a book called Get More, Spend Less. He profiled some
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:55:00.940]   of the options that are available for getting affiliate discounts on purchasing of cars
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:05.460]   or things like that. Consider if there's research, if there's some kind of discount program that's
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.620]   easily available to you. A lot of times a few minutes spent with a web search will save
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.540]   you tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.360]   Could you cancel a subscription and buy things one by one as you need them ad hoc? Most subscriptions,
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.980]   many subscriptions are more than is necessary. We talked about this recently with the cell
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:30.980]   phone usage. By canceling an ongoing cell phone need and doing it prepaid, you get exactly
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:37.680]   what you need. This month I needed more time on my cell phone so I bought another $10 worth
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:42.960]   of minutes. Well, that means my cost was $20 because I needed more than my usual $10 a
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:49.960]   month but that's less than the ongoing $40 or $50 that I would have been paying the other
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:57.400]   way. So could you cancel a subscription and just buy things little by little? On the other
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:01.160]   side obviously, could you start a subscription instead of buying things little by little?
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.480]   If you always buy magazines at checkout, it might be worth investigating a subscription
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   cost. Can you use the web to find forums filled with experts? Flyertalk forum has so much
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:17.720]   valuable information on how to get travel deals. Howard forums has so much information
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:23.960]   on cell phones. If you have a problem with your car, just type in the symptoms of your
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:28.640]   problem and the make and model of your car and you will find a forum filled with people
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.940]   that are experts on that car that probably have already asked that question. Use the
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:39.360]   web to find the forums and access those experts. Can you buy in bulk and save? A lot of people
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:46.360]   do this anyways but consider, can you buy in bulk and save? I had to chuckle, I was
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:51.760]   at a truck stop recently and in the convenience store in the truck stop, they were selling
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   bottled water. So there was a display case of bottled water where the bottles were $2
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:04.760]   for $2, so bottles were $1 each, $2 for $2 in the display case and they were refrigerated
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:11.280]   in individual servings. And right next to the display case, literally right next to
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.920]   the display case was a case of water, the standard, I think it's 32 bottles that come
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   in a case for $5. And I chuckled and I wondered how many people would choose to buy the $2.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:29.720]   Now the $5 ones were not cold, I recognize that. But the convenience store would give
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:36.720]   you probably ice for about 5 cents a cup. So buy the 32 for $5 instead of the 2 for
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:44.560]   $2. Could you research a discount for something that you already have? On your home insurance,
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.920]   have you gone through your home insurance with your insurance company, talk to them
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:54.240]   about all the discounts that you have. Can you get a discount for storm windows? Can
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.920]   you cut something by changing something out? Do you have a safety device, smoke detectors,
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.840]   things like that. On your car insurance, have you gone through every discount that's available
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:08.400]   to you and made sure that you're getting all those discounts. And Florida where I live,
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.520]   the local power company, Florida Power and Light, will give you a savings on your electricity
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:17.840]   bill if you'll allow them to install a device that at peak times of usage, they can cut
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:22.760]   the power to certain heavy draw appliances. So I have this on the air conditioning. That
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:27.440]   means that potentially in the hottest time of the summer, then they may temporarily on
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:32.800]   a limited basis, they may cut the electricity back from the AC. Well, often times it's not
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.920]   home during the day so it's not a big deal. And even when they do it, it's not that much
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.520]   but it does save a substantial amount. So research all the expenditures that you're
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   currently spending and look to see if there's a way that you could get a discount on an
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   expense that you already have. Try to find a smart source of the funds for your purchase.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:05.600]   So most people forget about this but try to look and see is there a way that I can buy
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:12.320]   this with smarter dollars. Could I pay for this out of a tax advantaged account? So my
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:17.320]   standard example here that I think of and use a lot myself is a health savings account.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:23.440]   A health savings account is a wonderful account which you pair with a high deductible health
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:29.480]   plan and it allows you to put pre-tax dollars in and to spend the money tax free on medical
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   expenses. Now there's a list of what medical expenses are available but that list is the
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:43.280]   IRS publication 502. I'll link to it in the show notes. But in that publication you can
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:49.600]   see everything you can spend money on. That includes everything from contacts and contact
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   solution to your deductibles and your copays at the doctor's office to everything to long
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   term care insurance premiums. So these little things add up. I work contacts and therefore
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:10.440]   contact solution is an ongoing consumption. Glasses you could say would be a good way
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:17.000]   of switching from that ongoing consumption to the contact solution. But anyway, I can
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.080]   buy the contact solution out of the health savings account and pay for it with pre-tax
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.960]   dollars. That's a good savings. So consider if there's some sort of tax advantaged account
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   that you can use. Can you pay for school out of some sort of account that allows you to
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   pay for that? A 529 plan or a covered LESA, could that be of help to you? Consider if
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.640]   there's an account that's available to you. Or could you pay for it out of a business
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   account? We're going to in the future do hopefully some deep dives on some of business expenses
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.800]   but I'll tell you. There are two tax codes. One for individuals and one for businesses.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:03.080]   And the really good one is for the businesses. The government as part of national tax policy,
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:09.680]   the government is very interested in you establishing and running a legitimate business. So consider
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.920]   is there a legitimate business expense that is associated with your expenditure? If not,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.320]   could you start a business associated with that? And then once you have that business,
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   you have an opportunity where you can start to use those business purposes and those business
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:33.280]   accounts with knowledge of what the rules are and you can start to structure your life
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   in such a way that you stack the functions. So if you're going to take an out of town
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:53.160]   trip for a business trip and you need a personal trip as well, can you combine those two things
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:02:00.440]   under the business trip rules? If you have a little known rule, if you have business
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:06.200]   meetings on Friday and on Monday, according to my understanding of the IRS rules, you're
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:12.520]   allowed to stay the weekend even if you're not conducting business and that weekend is
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.620]   a deductible. Your expenses for the stay of that weekend is a deductible business expense.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:23.680]   So you may have meetings on Thursday, Friday, Monday and Tuesday but there you've got an
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:30.560]   out of town visit that you can enjoy personally on Saturday and Sunday. That's my understanding
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:37.560]   of the rules. Little things like that add up, add up big time. Consider if you can pay
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:44.860]   for something out of a business account. Try to buy at the best time. Can you be, first
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:52.560]   of all, behind the times? So instead of being a leading buyer of technology, can you use
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.600]   the iPhone 4 instead of the iPhone 5? Can you wait a year to pick up the new product?
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.720]   Instead of being on the avant-garde of, I think that means in the front, instead of
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.240]   being on the front end of hybrid cars when they're very expensive, can you come along
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.960]   a couple years later and pick them up when they're a lot cheaper? So simply by just being
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:17.440]   a little bit behind the times, it'll save you a substantial amount of money. So consider,
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.960]   can you be behind the times? Can you buy off peak? Can you travel on the weekends or the
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.680]   holidays or in that shoulder season that we talked about? Or can you go to a region of
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.360]   the country or the world that's currently out of favor? It costs you a lot more to get
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.880]   to Europe right now from the US than it does to get to some other destination. So could
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.360]   you go to South America instead of to Europe? I'll tell you where the best travel deal is
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.200]   right now in the world, Egypt. Now I'm not sure most people aren't going to want to travel
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.920]   in Egypt right now, but a few years ago, Egypt was not that cheap to travel in. But today,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.320]   I guarantee there's deals left and right if you are one who's able to enjoy that style
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.840]   of travel. So can you travel to somewhere that's currently out of favor or travel in
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.040]   a time that's off peak? Can you buy something that's a little bit old but still good and
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:13.040]   repurpose? Could you buy the day old bread? The day old bread can, my example is, you
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.400]   know, if you're going to buy fresh, if you're going to butter up a piece of bread, I would
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.000]   probably want to bake it fresh or buy it fresh. But if you're going to make some French toast
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.200]   and you're going to take that bread and cover it with eggs, buy the day old bread, save
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:33.600]   the money. Can you plan ahead? So the best time to buy Halloween candy? The day after
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.120]   Halloween. Buy the Halloween candy the day after Halloween and save it for the next year.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:46.000]   Buy your Christmas gifts the day after Christmas. If you, this last year my wife and I went
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.320]   shopping the day after Christmas and stocked up on all of the birthday gifts that would
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:57.680]   be needed for the nieces and nephews and have a big box full of them. They're cheap the
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.360]   day after Christmas. They're not so cheap in March when you need them for the birthday.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.680]   But by planning ahead, you can save a substantial amount of money. If you're on a road trip,
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.120]   buy your gas in the cheap states before you drive across the expensive states. Can you
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:18.960]   buy at the right time or season? So buy your gardening stuff in the fall when the prices
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:24.640]   come down. Buy your car at the end of the month when the sales people are under pressure
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:32.020]   to make a deal. Buy your houses in a depressed market. Go back five or six years at the height
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.000]   of a real estate market. That's not the time to buy a house. But a couple of years later,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.880]   that's the time to buy a house. So look at what's happening in the market and consider
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:48.480]   the best time to make a decision. Buy a business when it's a tough time for the business. You
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:54.760]   can get a lot of deals if you're able to go against the flow and see the macro trends
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.680]   that are available. Try to find the best source for your product or service. So if you're
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.240]   going to buy something, can you buy it from a local supplier? A local supplier that supports
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.400]   your values and supports your communities. Could you buy it from a company that has certain
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.040]   ethics or certain business practices that are important to you that you want to support?
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:22.360]   For example, could you buy energy from a renewable source instead of just a cheaper conventional
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:29.480]   source? Or is there a company that treats its employees in a certain way that you feel
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:37.080]   better supporting with your dollars? Could you buy from a family member? If you're going
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:43.280]   to rent, could you rent from a family member? I'll be frank, I always scratch my head a
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.480]   little bit as to why so many young people don't simply rent from parents and family
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:54.040]   members. Now I understand the whole get your wings and fly, but for years I've rented from
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.840]   my parents. I want to make sure that they receive the value of my rent dollars instead
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:07.080]   of some unknown person. To me, I would rather support a family member instead of an unknown
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:14.720]   person. Could you buy from a smart place? Example here is Diamonds. Best place to buy
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:21.960]   Diamonds, at least according to my research right now, Costco. According to various, according
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.600]   to Consumer Reports, best place to buy Diamonds is Costco. Remember, Costco has a maximum
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:35.120]   14% markup and they have a well qualified, well regulated series of gemologists that
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.680]   will grade the Diamonds so you know the quality that you're getting and you got a maximum
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.800]   14% markup. Compare that to going to Tiffany's and buying your Diamond there. You're going
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:52.080]   to get the same product for substantially better value and lower cost. So consider that,
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.120]   consider the place that you get things like that. Do your research. Can you buy it used
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:04.880]   and still good or simply get it free? Can you buy something off of eBay or off of Freecycle?
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.680]   Interestingly earlier I mentioned the cloth diapers. One thing that I do and that my wife
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:16.040]   and I do is if we need something, often times we go on Freecycle and ask if anybody has
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:21.920]   it. So with cloth diapers, just went on Freecycle and asked if anyone had it. We got a bag of
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.720]   about, I think something like 10 or 20 of them for free. That's a substantial value
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.320]   in the marketplace but the person was able to pass them on for free and that was such
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:37.360]   a blessing. Right now I'm looking for some weights, like a weight set, a barbell set.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.560]   Well, go on Freecycle and I haven't actually gotten any responses to this one but the first
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:47.800]   thing I did was send out an email on Freecycle. So, worth considering. Try to see if you can
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.720]   get it used and still good or simply just get it for free. Can you buy from a company
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.920]   that has a lower built-in cost? So for example, can you bank with a credit union instead of
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:07.400]   a bank? This would be, this is extremely valuable. A credit union doesn't have stockholders that
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.280]   it has to make a profit for. So if you bank with a bank that is traded, either publicly
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:20.120]   traded like the big ones, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, SunTrust, these types of large
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:26.320]   banks that are publicly traded or that's privately owned, these banks are in the business of
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.760]   making money. There's nothing wrong with that. That's awesome. But you're going to contribute
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:39.440]   to that profit. So is there a local credit union that is going to wind up providing the
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:48.120]   same service for you with a lower cost? If so, could you seek that company out? If there's
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:53.040]   a local credit union, you'll get higher rates of return on your savings and your deposits
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.240]   and you'll get lower costs for loans. It's as simple as that. And the reason, if it's
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.600]   well run, and the reason is that the bank has to make a profit. The credit union does
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:11.800]   not exist to make a profit. It exists to serve its members. Could you buy from a mutual insurance
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.520]   company instead of a stock insurance company? In insurance companies, there are different
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.160]   ways that they're structured. One is where they're structured in a mutual format where
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:27.280]   there are no stockholders. So there are property and casualty insurers. My insurance, my car
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   insurance is with USAA. Every year I get a dividend check. And that dividend check is
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:38.720]   received and that's an amount of money that is received that is my refund for me on my
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:45.820]   premiums and it represents the insurance company's profit. That's refunded to me every year.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:50.700]   Could you work with, so that's different than another company that's in the business of
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.080]   making money and the only way I would be able to access that company's money is by owning
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.480]   their stock. Again, nothing wrong with that, but consider your choices. Could you work
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:09.120]   with some sort of co-op or collective instead of buying from a for-profit institution? And
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.520]   there are all kinds of interesting versions of this, so consider it. Could you buy in
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.000]   a different state, a different region, or a different country in order to get a better
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.880]   deal? So can you buy something in a different state to save on sales taxes? There are lots
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.200]   of places where people live close to a state line and they'll go across the line to buy
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.560]   their goods in order to save on sales taxes. Do the research. If you're going to make a
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.120]   big acquisition, that could be something that's substantial. Could you buy in a different
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:46.400]   region of the country where the demand or the price is different? An example is, recently
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.600]   I was reading an article talking about Subarus. Up in the Pacific Northwest and up in the
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:59.680]   North, Subarus are very popular and in very high demand. So the prices tend to be a little
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.760]   bit higher. In the South, however, they're not so popular. So the company evidently,
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:13.240]   according to the article that I read, is working to increase their sales in the South and offering
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.080]   much better deals in the South. Well, if you live in the Pacific Northwest, now may be
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:26.800]   a great time to fly to Florida, buy yourself a car, and have an enjoyable road trip home
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.120]   for a lower cost than what you would have paid just to get the car back home. So look
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.560]   to see if there's a different region or a different country. So as far as country, Mercedes
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.720]   Benz and BMW, I think, and some of the other German car makers have programs. I'm not sure
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.680]   if all of them do. I've read about some of them and I don't remember the names. But some
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:53.120]   of them have programs where you can buy the car at their factory in Europe and then you
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.400]   can drive your new car throughout Europe on a European vacation. And then when you're
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.600]   done, you take it to the port and they'll ship it back to the U.S. for you. That's a
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:08.040]   good way of building in a lot of savings if you buy direct from the factory. I guess it's
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.360]   not technically direct. It's going to be through a dealer. But you're saving because you're
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.040]   buying from the factory and then you've got a trip through Europe. Think about things
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   like medical tourism. Medical tourism is increasingly really a growing market. So if you've got
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:28.360]   an expensive amount of, a large amount of dental expenses coming up, and these are planned
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:33.800]   dental expenses, sometimes you can go to another country, have the work done at an equivalent
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.240]   value and equivalent skill level for such a substantial discount that your trip winds
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:46.000]   up being free. There are countries in Asia, countries in South America that are specializing
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.120]   in this. It goes beyond just dental stuff as well. I've read an article of somebody
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.840]   who went to Mexico to have their baby because it was a substantially cheaper value than
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.480]   it was, a substantially cheaper price than it was in the U.S. and had a very good experience.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:07.840]   So consider that. Could you find some sort of waste stream to use? And these are all
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.840]   trying to find the best source of products. So is there a waste stream? Is there an off,
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:20.760]   a waste, I don't know what else to call it, a waste stream that's going out from a business
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:27.760]   or from a service nearby? So the one that I use is can you order up a truckload of wood
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.160]   chips from the local tree company that has to pay to dispose of those things and was
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.360]   happy to drop them off for free? Or can you order up a load of manure for your garden
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:46.040]   from the local horse stable? All these things are free mulch and you can use it and spread
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:52.600]   it out on your property instead of paying for it. If you need compost, the local municipal
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:59.680]   dump where I live has free mulch and free compost that is available. Can you find some
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   sort of waste stream for other purposes? Can you find food for your animals? Could you
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.920]   see a bunch of food that's consistently thrown away that's appropriate for your animals?
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   Consider it. Could you get free bones for your dogs or free vegetables for your pets?
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.120]   I don't know. Consider it. Look for stuff for free on the side of the road. You'd be
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.960]   shocked at the stuff that I often see for free and pick up for free. Get the absolute
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:38.120]   best product or service that you can find. Research the best value. Use resources like
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.680]   consumer reports. Even better, use online forums. You're going to learn more in an online
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.300]   forum about what's the best value in a specific area than just about anything else. So look
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:54.300]   for the best value. Can you buy it for life? An example would be instead of buying a Teflon
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:00.080]   pan that you're going to have to be replacing in a year or two, could you buy a cast iron
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.400]   pan which could potentially last for three generations? Could you buy a vehicle that's
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.120]   going to last for a long period of time? Could you buy a vehicle that's renowned for quality,
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   a Toyota, a Honda, something like that, that's renowned for a long lifespan instead of the
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   option that's just simply cheaper up front? Can you buy a product that you can repair?
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:29.200]   This is something that we don't think about much in a disposable society, but can you
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.640]   actually fix the product? It may be worth it to buy something that you could take apart
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.020]   and fix if it broke rather than something where you have to scrap the whole thing and
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:42.580]   buy a new one. Could you buy a more efficient version? So could you buy the high efficiency
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:49.580]   appliance instead of the less efficient version? Could you buy a product that has less processing,
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:56.560]   that's maybe lower on the value chain? Can you buy just straight, the example here is
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:03.400]   bagged rice instead of the rice that's microwave rice? You're going to get cheaper prices.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.580]   Can you just buy something that hasn't had all the inputs put into it and get a much
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:14.320]   lower cost for it? Try to substitute something else in order to get the best solution. So
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.640]   here are some of the ideas I came up with on this one. Could you easily do without and
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.280]   not experience negative consequences? Sometimes it's actually pretty simple to just simply
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:29.280]   do without. We often don't think of that though. Can I just do without? Decide that I don't
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:38.600]   need this and it's no big deal. Just skip it. Skip the purchase. In a modern consumer
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:46.440]   society many people purchase things just purely off of impulse. They don't want to spend
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.240]   off the impulse instead of just simply consider if you could just do without this. Can you
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:58.240]   completely eliminate the need for an expense? So you can optimize your commuting costs,
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:05.040]   that's true. But could you just live closer to your job? Is there a way that you can just
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:12.040]   simply eliminate the expense? Could you use what you already have and wear it out? Can
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.600]   you drive your car for an extra 100,000 miles? Could you ride that bike for a little bit
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.640]   longer? Most of the time, much of the time the answer is yes. I had a car that I drove
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:29.480]   to 315,000 miles. I was so proud of it. And I actually know the person who owns it now.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.880]   It's still going strong at 350,000 miles. Things like cars, your best bet is wear them
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.000]   out and wear them out to the point where they literally have to be driven to a junkyard
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   where they have zero resale value. Wear out your clothes. Wear things out. Once you've
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.760]   bought something, wear it out. Could you change your mind instead of your circumstance? Example
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   here is I'm fascinated with RVs. Someday I'd like to have a nice RV I enjoy. I think it
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.320]   would be really fun, especially intrigued by truck campers that go on the back of your
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:13.640]   pickup truck. But the question is, is it really about having the RV or is it really about
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:19.800]   taking the trip? I can have a lot of fun with a tent in the back of my car. It doesn't cost
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   me any money. And just set up a stove. More than I need the RV. So I can and do adjust
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:33.920]   my mind. It's not about having the gear. It's about simply having the experience and the
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.360]   experience. If you're camping with kids, your kids are going to have just as good a time
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   sleeping in a tent as they are going to be sleeping in a $100,000 RV. So could you change
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:49.000]   your mind instead of your circumstances? Can you adjust your real goal? If you want to
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.800]   take a road trip to South America, that's one of my things, can you just use the car
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.720]   that you have? Is that the goal? Is the goal to take the trip? Or is the goal to have a
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.400]   super cool vehicle that you spend lots of money on? Either is fine. If you're into the
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.680]   super cool vehicle, awesome. But a lot of people, if they would just simply go, you
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.840]   can do the trip in what you have. Everywhere in the world they drive cars. Can you just
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.840]   do without something? On the car thing, do you need a fancy roof rack or not? Many people
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:27.560]   buy an expensive fancy roof rack and sometimes you just don't need one. I watched someone,
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:31.880]   you could buy a fancy roof rack to put your surfboards on. You're in Florida where I live,
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:38.320]   you could see that. The other day I saw somebody who took two Fun Noodles, purchased for about
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.440]   50 cents from the local discount store, threw them on his roof and strapped his surfboard
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:50.440]   onto that. So can you just do without or substitute something else? Can you make or grow it yourself?
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.480]   Could you grow some of your food? Can you make something yourself instead of buying
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:03.160]   something? Could you repurpose something else? I was watching a friend recently, a friend
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.600]   has some chickens, they turned a dresser that was old and worn out into a chicken coop and
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.520]   then added some screening around it. But the dresser drawers is where the chickens stay
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:19.520]   and the main structure became the structure for their chicken coop. That's a valuable
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:27.240]   thing to do, just repurpose something. Can you increase your internal strength so that
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:34.240]   you don't have to keep up with the Joneses? Are you strong enough to chart your own path?
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:44.080]   This one's free, go to the library and get some books on building your internal self-image.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.320]   But can you chart your own path instead of having to keep up with everyone else just
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:54.320]   simply because you're stronger as a person? Can you buy something one time instead of
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:05.080]   an ongoing expense? So if you are someone who going to movies is really important to
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:10.240]   you, could you put in a really nice movie theater into your home that you love being
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.640]   in instead of going out to the movie theater every week or two? Can you just pay for it
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:22.080]   one time and have the ongoing expense be a lot lower? Or flip it out, are you someone
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.280]   who you're not going to go that much but you're putting in an expensive theater that you're
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.080]   not going to use that much, just go to the movies instead of putting in a nice one. So
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:38.080]   flip it, consider your actual needs. Could you buy a business that's associated with
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.920]   something instead of paying for the something? You probably aren't going to, this one, but
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:50.920]   I know a friend of mine who bought a golf course. He's a golfer, he golfs his own course
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.600]   now, he still golfs other courses, but now he's in the business, he's taken his love
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.360]   of a business and turned it into an income, his love of a sport and turned it into an
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:06.640]   income stream and now other people pay him to golf on his course and it really wasn't
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.080]   that expensive that he did. I won't go into any more details but it's kind of interesting.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.880]   Could you buy something that's more concentrated? Could you buy shaving oil instead of shaving
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:22.440]   cream or something that has more of the good stuff? Could you change your habits? Simply
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.800]   associate your habits, we talked about with cell phones, do you need to talk on the phone
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:32.400]   in the car or can you talk at home where the cost is cheaper? I've used for years a dictation
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.480]   service, that dictation service is a great service, the one I use is called Copy Talk,
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.960]   it's a great service but an ongoing monthly subscription. I was able to find a new solution
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:49.380]   using Dragon on the computer and just simply by changing my habits instead of doing stuff
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:54.160]   from my cell phone in the car, I was able to record my notes in front of the computer,
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.480]   it saves a substantial amount of money. Could you increase your skill instead of buying
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.280]   yourself a solution? So a lot of times you have to buy solutions for things that you're
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:08.120]   not skillful in. An example would be if you need some sort of financial tracking software,
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.040]   there's lots of free versions out there but let's say you're going to pay for something
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:16.400]   like Microsoft Money or Quicken or QuickBooks or something like that, could you simply learn
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.480]   to run an Excel spreadsheet? It's probably already on your computer, if it's not use
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:29.480]   an open office, open source version and replace the buying decision with increasing the skill.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:37.520]   Can you use the library instead of buying books, magazines, e-books, etc.? My library
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:47.320]   has a wonderful website and they have an option where I can go on there and I can request
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.120]   books to be sent to the one that's very near my house, actually about a quarter mile, a
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.520]   third of a mile away from my house. So by anytime I'm going to buy a book or I'm interested
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:00.160]   in something, I just pull up their website, hit reserve, they'll send that book to that
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.760]   library for me. I can do it right online, right when the impulse strikes and I'm giving
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   into my impulse of getting a book but I'm not paying for it except with my taxes. So
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.280]   consider if either that tip is useful for you with your books and magazines and things
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.120]   like that or if there's some other way that you can take that idea and use it with something
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:29.120]   else. Can you do things yourself instead of outsourcing them? So can you mow your lawn
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.240]   yourself instead of hiring it done? Can you clean your pool yourself instead of hiring
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:39.200]   it done? Can you do your taxes yourself instead of hiring it done? A lot of times by simply
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.360]   doing things yourself, you can save a substantial amount of money. Now on the flip side, can
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.200]   you outsource something instead of doing it yourself and save a substantial amount of
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.360]   money? It's possible that you could learn to do your taxes yourself and if your situation
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:00.600]   is very simple, you probably should. But if you have any complexity whatsoever, perhaps
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.840]   a good tax advisor could save you far more than they cost you. You might be able to do
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.280]   your own legal work but perhaps having a good attorney work for you is going to save you
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.960]   far more than it costs you. You might be able to do your own financial planning but perhaps
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.920]   hiring an advisor may save you more than it costs you. You might be able to pull your
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:27.000]   own tooth but perhaps hiring it done would save you more than it costs you. So this is
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   going to depend on your complexity and going to depend on your situation. So consider both
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   sides of that. Consider doing something yourself instead of having it outsourced or consider
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.440]   simply hiring a business to do something for you or hiring somebody to do something for
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:52.440]   you instead of doing it yourself. Can you combine and repurpose two things? Example
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:27:03.600]   here is a friend who uses boats and a few years ago he wanted to repower his boat and
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:11.080]   add some new outboard engines to his boat. Now, I don't know, those of you who aren't
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   boaters, outboard engines can be a substantial investment, $20,000 to $30,000 plus for a
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:24.360]   large powerful outboard engine and his had two. What he did was he bought an extra boat
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:30.200]   that had better engines on it, took the engines off of his boat, put them on the new boat,
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.920]   flipped the engines out so he had the better engines off the one he bought for the boat
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:40.920]   that he wanted to keep and then resold the boat. And he basically had, he didn't want
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.840]   to sell the boat for the total cost but his cost of the new engines was substantially
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   cheaper than what it would have been otherwise. So consider that. Could you have a junker
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.160]   parts car that you buy and then put those parts in or could you find some way to do
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.480]   this with other items? Maybe you're not a car or a boat person. But I thought it was
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.360]   such a great idea. Buy a boat for the engines, take the engines off of it, put your old ones
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.520]   on there and then resell the thing and it was a lot cheaper than going out and buying
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:20.160]   the new engines a la carte. Can you substitute for something better? Can you take money that
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.120]   you would spend on college tuition and spend it on global travel tuition? My personal opinion,
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.780]   you're going to learn a lot more traveling for a year than you are in a college classroom.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:35.760]   So it might be worth it. Could you use new technology instead of old? Could you use a
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:40.400]   virtual classroom for college instead of the physical classroom? Is there some kind of
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.880]   new technology that you could use? Can you do a Skype meeting or a GoTo meeting instead
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   of needing to get on an airplane and travel someplace? Worth considering. Could you choose
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   different hobbies that are by nature less expensive than others? So could you choose
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:05.620]   consciously to enjoy and find fulfillment in gardening instead of racing cars? And could
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:12.620]   you choose to get your adrenaline and enjoyment out of gardening? Something that makes money
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:26.460]   for you if you're eating your own food instead of something that costs you a substantial
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:30.340]   amount of money. Or maybe can you just make a switch to mountain biking instead of racing
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:35.700]   cars? I knew somebody who was very wealthy and I talked to them about their wealth strategy
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:41.340]   and they didn't have one. Didn't have a strong financial plan, didn't have a strong wealth
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:46.020]   strategy. But I asked them about his lifestyle and his lifestyle was, his hobby was mountain
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.140]   biking. Not that expensive to throw a mountain bike on the back of a car, even a really nice
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:57.340]   one. A lot cheaper to be a mountain biker than to be into driving big giant 4x4s across
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:04.340]   the country or racing cars at 100+ miles an hour. Can you enjoy reading instead of movies?
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:11.580]   Little things like that make a big, big difference. Can you use something instead of owning it?
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:18.580]   So can you use land or use a community garden instead of having to buy yourself land or
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:24.420]   buy yourself a house that has what you need in it? Can you live in an apartment instead
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:30.340]   of owning a house? Sometimes you're going to have lower costs there. Can you optimize
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:35.740]   in order to eliminate an expense completely? I actually already touched on this one but
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   on my notes I imagine you can completely optimize your efficient, develop an efficient commute.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:49.620]   Could you just live right next to your job? If I were working at McDonald's, I guarantee
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:56.540]   you I would be living close to my job. Sometimes maybe just by cutting out a commute you could
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:02.260]   save yourself a substantial amount of money. So consider there's some way that you can
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:08.500]   just simply eliminate an expense instead of buying that expense. With your lawn, could
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:15.500]   you xeriscape your yard instead of paying someone to cut it? Can you build something
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:22.220]   yourself? Can you make your own furniture instead of buying it? Can you build a bunk
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:27.940]   bed for your kids instead of spending for one? Can you use a cheap technology instead
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:34.740]   of an expensive technology? A lot of times there's simple and inexpensive solutions available
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:40.900]   and there's expensive and complex solutions available. Two that I'm interested in, one
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:46.860]   is my house in Florida is currently poorly insulated and it seems like the best insulation
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:53.300]   that I can do is this spray foam insulation on the underside of the roof deck. And I'm
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:59.020]   considering doing it but man is it expensive. One alternative idea that I've read about
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:03.660]   that I'm interested in trying and seeing if it works is to set up basically a sprinkler
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:09.940]   system on your roof that during the day when it's hot it pours water on the roof and soaks
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:16.860]   the roof and then it uses evaporative cooling to achieve the same goal that the spray foam
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:21.740]   insulation could achieve. I don't know if I'm going to do it, I don't know if it works,
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:27.340]   but it's a good example to me of an inexpensive technology of using something like that instead
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:34.260]   of the expensive technology. I recently was looking at some articles on an urban homesteading
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:41.660]   blog about using what they call Oya's for irrigation. Oya's is just an unglazed clay
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:47.660]   pot that you stick down in the soil and fill it with water and then because it's unglazed
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:52.060]   the water gets out of the pot over time and keeps the roots of your plants wet and your
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:59.820]   roots can get the water from it. Could you do something like that instead of an expensive
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:06.180]   color heads? Look for the cheap and simple before you look for the expensive and complex.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:12.860]   Can you replace maintenance intensive versions of things with low maintenance? So I mentioned
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:19.500]   lawns. Do you have to have a very high maintenance lawn or can you figure out a landscaping system
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:28.140]   that is less maintenance? Can you change the style and be a trendsetter instead of a follower?
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:32.780]   I had to chuckle. I don't know if you've heard it. There's a rap song. I don't even know
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:40.220]   what the name of it is. I just had to laugh when I heard it. It's quite popular now where
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:46.980]   the entire song is about the good deal the guy got on his clothes from Goodwill and about
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:51.060]   how the fact that he wears his grandfather's clothes from Goodwill and that's his style.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:57.580]   Now I'm not really into the song. I thought it was pretty funny to listen to, but consider
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:02.420]   what the guy was doing. Can you be out in front changing the style and you're the one
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:09.140]   who sets it? Can you be the one who's buying clothes from Goodwill and not being the style
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:17.820]   instead of following everyone else? Could you use technology to bypass limitations?
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:25.140]   There's a singer I was reading about the other day. I think his name was Alex Day. The young
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:30.260]   man has just simply done a brilliant job of building up a following on YouTube and has
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.660]   never had a record label and has never paid for any of that stuff. He's just done it all
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:41.260]   on YouTube himself. I subscribe to some guys called the Piano Guys. Same type of thing.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.300]   They put all their music on YouTube and have all their views there and that's their primary
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:50.820]   recording system that bypasses all of the record, all of the establishment. Can you
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:55.460]   self-publish a book and put it on Amazon for Kindle download? Lots of people are doing
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.460]   it. It's a lot cheaper and it bypasses all the cost of all those things. Can you learn
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:05.060]   the details of what you need to do from a library book instead of paying for advice
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:11.140]   because you're uneducated? So can you go and study something? Can you learn about taxes
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:17.700]   or learn about another plumbing or something? All this knowledge is available from you.
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.940]   The world's knowledge is available from an internet connection and from a library. You
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:27.140]   probably have both of those already in your life. Can you simply eliminate something instead
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:33.460]   of paying someone else? So can you again zero-scape your yard instead of doing landscaping? Can
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:38.620]   you design something to be working passively? So can you develop a water efficient property
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:44.100]   instead of having to water your lawn? Can you develop the structures and the contours
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:49.660]   of the property where the water gets retained in the soil instead of you having to go out
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:54.940]   and turn on your sprinkler every day? This is something where I'm fascinated by and really
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:36:01.060]   interested in and at some point maybe we'll do a show about these types of things. But
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:06.380]   just design it. Can you design your property to be productive instead of without a lot
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:13.220]   of maintenance instead of being an energy sink? So can you plant fruit trees instead
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:19.860]   of ornamental trees? Can you repurpose wasted space? Can you put solar panels up on your
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:28.240]   roof to heat water or to give you electricity? These types of things could save you substantial
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.860]   money because you take an ongoing cost and you turn it into something that's a one-time
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:37.980]   cost. Well now, instead of having to constantly take money and run it through the tax system
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:44.620]   where you pay income taxes and ongoing utility taxes and pay for something every month, maybe
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:52.100]   you can take something and turn it into a one-time cost that you can lower your income
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:56.660]   from and still enjoy a high lifestyle. Can you replace the expert and become the expert
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   yourself? We talked about this already but can you just simply learn about something
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:07.140]   instead of having to hire an expert? Or can you simply hire the expert for a small amount
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:14.140]   of time and save yourself lots and lots of money? There are a lot of examples but there
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.420]   are so many things when people do their own taxes or their own investments or things like
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:26.900]   that, make many, many mistakes. An example would be an expert would immediately say you
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:30.180]   always put your income producing assets into your retirement accounts. You own your bonds
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:36.700]   in your retirement accounts and you own your stocks in taxable accounts if you have those.
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:42.020]   And an expert would know that immediately but many people haven't thought about that.
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:46.020]   You put your corporate bonds inside of your taxable accounts and you hold your muni bonds
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:51.900]   out of it. Teach you how to buy the right class of stock for your situation. So could
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:57.340]   you hire an expert just for a little bit of time that would help you? Consider that. Consider
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:03.440]   can you do it yourself or consider can you hire an expert. Next, what if you made money
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.360]   on the deal instead of it costing you money? So can you get something for free and then
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:17.660]   resell it? Can you turn an expense into an income stream? The free and then resell it,
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:25.100]   I've had people offer me stuff. A friend of mine had some floor mats for his car. He said
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:30.220]   sure I'll take them. They were for a specific brand of car, actually for a Land Rover. I
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:34.140]   knew somebody that had a Land Rover, asked if they wanted them and was able to resell
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:39.860]   them to him and was able to get some income off of it. Turning an expense into an income
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:45.420]   stream, there are all kinds of great new ideas that are coming out. There's an idea called
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:51.100]   Park at My House, link in the show notes, where people park their car at your house
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:55.900]   while they travel. So instead of them paying a much higher cost to park at the airport,
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:39:02.420]   to park at your house, you rent out your driveway and have income from it. There's a new idea
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:07.740]   that's being tested out called Flight Car. And the idea is that you can rent your car
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:14.020]   out while you travel instead of paying to park it. So you fly, this company arranges
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:18.680]   for a rental of your car while you're gone and you receive income for it. Obviously there's
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.260]   challenges associated with that but what a cool idea. Flight Car. Can you rent a spare
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:31.260]   room out on Airbnb? If you have a spare bedroom, rent it out for part of the time. Or maybe
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:39.980]   you have a back, a little mother-in-law shack behind your house type of thing. Incidentally,
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:47.940]   you can collect up to two weeks of income for the rental of your personal house and
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:54.580]   that income is received completely income tax free in the US tax code. So can you do
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:40:00.300]   a house swap while you're on vacation? I'll link to an article Mr. Money Mustache wrote
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:06.100]   about what he did doing this, renting his entire house out while you're on vacation.
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:10.380]   What a cool way to finance a vacation. What a cool way to take something that most people
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:15.900]   have as an expense and turn it into an income. Can you pull income from something that's
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:22.900]   just simply usually an expense? It used to be that less now than in the past but in the
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:29.540]   past you could find companies that would pay you to wrap your car with advertising while
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:35.980]   you're driving around. And these companies would pay you a fee based upon the amount
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:39.380]   how much you drive every day and what your car is, what kind of car it is and they'll
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:43.900]   give you a wrap for a local company and that car becomes a rolling advertisement for them.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:50.900]   So there's an expense that you usually have that you can now create an income stream from
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:57.020]   because you put a billboard on your land. I always think about the landowners that have
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:03.700]   land next to highways and I wonder what the rents they receive on the billboards they
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:08.020]   put out there on their arm. I'm sure it's not a ton but I'm sure it's better than nothing.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:12.460]   Maybe it pays their property taxes or something like that. There are people who've tattooed
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:17.420]   logos on their body for pay. There's a guy who started, I'll link to all this in the
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:24.420]   show notes, there's a guy who wears a t-shirt for pay. And so I think it's Iwearyourshirt.com
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:31.700]   or something like that. And he allows people to send him their shirts and he wears them
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:44.420]   for pay. This same guy, his former name was actually Jason Sadler. Currently his name
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:51.420]   is jasonheadsets.com. So he auctioned off his last name. He put up a website called
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:57.980]   buymylastname.com and auctioned off his last name. And headsets.com bought his last name
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:04.980]   for a year and so he's officially changed his name and everywhere he goes it's jasonheadsets.com.
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:09.260]   Interesting idea. Can you rent an extra room in your house or build an apartment behind
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:13.340]   your house to rent out? There are a lot of times where maybe someone has a little bit
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.140]   of land, could you build just a small garage apartment and rent it out for several hundred
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:22.740]   dollars a month? That can be substantial over time. The point is that consider if there's
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:26.620]   something that you have that's currently an expense or where you have space and figure
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:32.620]   out if there's a way to get paid for it. Could you buy an RV for your business and then wrap
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:39.620]   it with your business name for the advertising? Can you turn an expense into an income stream
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:46.980]   by using your inside knowledge? So for example, if you're into wearing expensive name brand
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:52.100]   clothes can you buy them at good deals from consignment shops and then resell them when
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:57.020]   you're done with them? Instead of it being an expensive hobby it becomes either a cost
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:04.020]   neutral or maybe even a cost positive endeavor. Books, I've seen people do this with books
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:11.020]   that are into books. Can you turn your hobbies into money? So if you are into something like
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:17.380]   scuba diving, that's awesome, it's a hobby. Could you become a part time instructor at
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:22.560]   the local scuba diving club? Well this would allow you to number one earn a little bit
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:28.860]   of extra income, number two be around the scuba diving environment and you would have
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:35.140]   opportunities to dive with your students where you're being paid to dive. You'd also have
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:40.620]   opportunities to now where if the club has a boat I guarantee the instructors use the
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:45.060]   club property and are able to go out and do their own dives from time to time. They're
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:50.100]   able to use the club equipment without necessarily paying a fee for it each and every time. So
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:53.820]   could you take a hobby like that and turn it into an income stream? You could probably
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:58.020]   do the same thing with hang gliding or flying and become a flight instructor. I know a lot
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:02.940]   of people who are around aviation work as flight instructors and it allows them to get
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:09.940]   time in the airplane and get paid for it or have discounts on services. Could be worth
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:16.400]   pursuing. Now those may not be your hobbies but is there some way that you could apply
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:22.540]   that same thought process to your own hobby? Could you buy something in bulk and then resell
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:27.860]   part of it? So I'm interested in getting some grass fed beef. Well in order to do that I
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:33.100]   kind of have to buy a whole cow. So could I buy, this is a question I'm asking myself,
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:39.140]   could I buy an entire cow, turn around and distribute parts of it and charge people something
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:46.140]   for my time and effort of doing this and then wind up with a lower cost or maybe no cost
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:52.220]   for my share of the meat just simply by doing the work. There are lots of things where people
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:56.620]   could maybe arrange something like this. Buy something in bulk and then resell it. Can
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:00.900]   you eliminate the expense of something completely? So instead of, you know, can you store your
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:03.900]   stuff on Craigslist? It's one of my favorite things. I can't remember where I first heard
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.800]   that idea or maybe I made it up. I have no idea. But instead of paying for a storage
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:16.800]   unit which holds your stuff, why don't you just sell your stuff? Have it on Craigslist.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.660]   Other people buy it and if you need it you go back on Craigslist and you can find someone
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:24.980]   else selling the stuff right back to you. So store your stuff on Craigslist. Can you
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:30.460]   buy it there if you need it there? So when you're traveling instead of having a big bag
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:34.220]   full of all the stuff that you might need, just take a little bag and buy it there if
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:40.740]   you actually need it. You'll save on baggage fees and just the straight up hassle. Can
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:46.820]   you increase your skill when using something? Example would be if you've got to have an
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:51.780]   expense, could you learn to increase your skill with handling it? Could you learn when
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:58.140]   you're driving to drive more efficiently? I'll link to a video on this guy on YouTube,
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:04.380]   a really interesting video. The video is called the Mad Max Hypermile. Everybody drives this
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:10.060]   big old pickup truck and gets 20-30 miles per gallon out of it. Now it's pretty extreme
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:16.140]   but remember we're studying the extreme to learn and to back up to what we can do today.
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:20.820]   Can you learn to, if you're going to travel, can you increase your travel skill and learn
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:27.620]   how to work through frequent flyer programs and get deals and discounts? So use the expenses
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:31.300]   that you're already going to have and pay for things efficiently. Can you take care
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:34.580]   of what you already have instead of replacing it? Even if you get something for free, can
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:40.460]   you just take care of your stuff? Eliminate the expense of replacing something by being
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:45.180]   gentle with it, by caring for it. Is there an alternative to buying something? Can you
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:49.900]   rent instead of own? If you need a pickup truck twice a year, can you just rent one
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:53.780]   instead of going out and buying one? If you enjoy going out on the boat a few times a
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:47:00.100]   year, can you rent a boat or join a boat club or simply charter a boat? If you once a year
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:06.020]   take an out of town road trip and you need a reliable car to take you across the country
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:09.100]   instead of an older car or a bigger car to take you across the country, can you just
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:15.580]   rent one? It might be worth considering. Or flip it around, can you own instead of rent?
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:22.300]   So are there things that you can do instead of leasing something, can you buy it inexpensively?
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:28.420]   Instead of leasing your cable modem, can you buy one? So always consider, is it more cost
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:33.660]   effective to rent instead of own or is it more cost effective to own instead of rent?
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:38.180]   Can you carpool or can you share? Can you carpool on a ride? Can you share a ride? Can
[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:44.560]   you share tools instead of buy them? Can you borrow your neighbor's tools instead of going
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.980]   out and buying all your own and in exchange you lend him the specialty tools that you
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:56.420]   have? This can be applied in a library concept. Can you get your kids toys from the toy library?
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:01.060]   Instead of buying new toys for them every few months, can you go to the toy library
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:06.380]   and swap out their toys? If there's not one in your town, start one. Start a tool library.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:13.500]   The library concept is such a great concept, it could be applied in so many different areas.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:21.220]   If you need to borrow money, borrow money in an intelligent manner. So can you do intelligent
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:26.300]   financing? Most people, many people, when they go out and buy a house, they kind of
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:30.340]   automatically say, "I'm going to take out a 30 year mortgage." But what if a 30 year
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:34.500]   fixed rate mortgage isn't right for you? And I'm not saying that it is or isn't, just saying,
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:40.700]   think about it. So many times, maybe it would be better for you to do something like a 5/1
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:46.260]   adjustable rate mortgage or a 7/1 arm. Most people don't stay in their houses for 30 years.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:55.940]   Why overpay on interest for the first 5 or 7 or 10 years of a mortgage when you're not
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.780]   going to stay there for that long? Now, you need to read the fine print, you need to be
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:03.900]   careful as rates may adjust for you. But many people could save a substantial amount of
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:08.780]   money by pursuing a different financing strategy. Or if you're going to borrow on a fixed rate
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:14.180]   mortgage, could you borrow on a 10 or 15 year mortgage instead of a 30 year mortgage? There's
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:19.700]   a substantial spread in interest rates between 10 or 15 year mortgages and 30 year mortgages.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:24.500]   And the reason, at least as far as my research, has largely to do with the default rate. People
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:28.420]   are much more likely to default on a 30 year mortgage than on a 10 or 15 year mortgage.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:36.740]   So because of that higher default rate on 30 years, that's built into the cost of the
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:40.700]   loan. Well, if you're not going to default, and if you can afford the payment, shorten
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:45.700]   up the term of that loan and save yourself a substantial amount of interest. If you need
[01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:51.940]   to borrow money, can you do it with unsecured financing instead of secured debt? So can
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:56.860]   you borrow off of something where, for some reason, something happened beyond your control
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:01.940]   and you weren't able to make the payments, the debt is not secured by property. It's
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:08.540]   unsecured credit card debt or unsecured personal loan instead of attached to a house or attached
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:15.220]   to a car that could be repossessed. This would be an example just in a practical application.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:20.100]   I struggle sometimes to understand why people put additional debt onto their house through
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:25.060]   the form of a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit instead of doing unsecured
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:29.060]   debt on a credit card. Well, there can be reasons to do both. The house may have a better
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:33.140]   interest rate. You may be able to borrow the money at more favorable terms. But there also
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:38.100]   may be reasons to do it unsecured instead of secured. Can you get non-recourse loans
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:44.180]   instead of recourse loans where if you do default on it, then if you do default on the
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:50.700]   loan, the lender is not able to come after you for the balance. Can you be careful with
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:57.700]   your assets and make sure that you build wealth and assets that aren't attachable or that
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:02.340]   aren't judgment proof? The state of Florida where I live has a very generous homestead
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:09.340]   exemption where if you were to be sued and were to be forced to declare bankruptcy, you
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:14.620]   could retain the entire value of your house with no dollar limit as far as the value of
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:21.500]   that house. So it would make a lot of sense to have a paid off home and borrow on other
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:28.420]   property instead of on your personal home. Also IRA funds. IRA funds generally, depending
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.340]   on IRAs and 401(k)s, generally protected in bankruptcy court. So it wouldn't make sense
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:38.780]   to borrow against a 401(k) in many examples if you were worried about things like that.
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:42.300]   Now, it may make sense if that's where you needed the money, but consider it. Can you
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:49.300]   save for something? So save money. Set up an automatic savings fund, an emergency fund
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:56.740]   or a travel fund or a car maintenance fund or an insurance fund. Save the money. Pay
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:02.580]   your insurance on a six month or once a year and get the difference and then just you set
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:06.780]   aside the money instead of doing it every month. Can you use other people's money, other
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:11.220]   people's time or other people's resources instead of your own? The real estate industry
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:18.220]   made the OPM words famous, but it's still very, very applicable. So can you use and
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:23.420]   leverage somehow other people's money, other people's time or other people's resources?
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:30.420]   That's what business people do. That's the whole point and nature of business. Can you
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:36.420]   substitute other kinds of capital instead of financial capital? So instead of spending
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:43.420]   money on something, can you have social capital? By the fact that you have a lot of friends,
[01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:48.900]   you can borrow something from them. That's social capital. Can you substitute knowledge?
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:52.420]   So for example, if you need a weed eater, are you able to fix the weed eater for a friend
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:56.260]   of yours and you borrow the weed eater and fix it and return it? I know I'm stretching
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:53:03.260]   a little bit with the examples, but think about how this could be applied to your situation.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:10.620]   Look for ways, for example, student loans. Could you repay your student loans with some
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:15.080]   of the government debt forgiveness programs instead of paying them back yourself? Run
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:19.340]   the calculations on that kind of thing. Run the calculations and see if there are programs
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:23.820]   available for you. If you have student loans, can you work for it as a teaching program,
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:29.900]   there are medical programs. Look to see if there's a program where instead of you paying
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:34.260]   back your student loans, the government will forgive the debt for you. I wish the program
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:40.500]   weren't there, but it is, so why don't you use it? Can you set something up where, for
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:45.220]   example, there's a website called You Promise where they'll pay back your student loans
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:49.380]   with a percentage of your expenditures if you buy through their portal. So can you buy
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:52.900]   things that you would buy anyway, but buy them through You Promise and have them pay
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:58.620]   back your student loan based upon that rate? Can you start a business doing things you
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:04.100]   want to do anyway? If you're into cars and you would be spending a lot of money on cars,
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:11.100]   start a car racing business and have the racing be your business. Excellent tax planning and
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:17.020]   also fun and you may make a bunch of money. If you love to fish, start a fishing charter
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:22.460]   or a fishing guide service. Be smart about where you place assets. So if you have an
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:26.900]   expensive car and a personal car, you should always put the expensive car into your business
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:33.540]   where you can depreciate it as a business expense instead of into your personal world.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:37.060]   Also the higher ongoing expenses could be paid for with deductible dollars instead of
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:44.060]   non-deductible dollars. So consider where you place an asset. Be intelligent about it.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:51.060]   If there's a hobby that you're into, why not start a business? If you were a yoga fanatic
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:55.940]   or a piano teacher, why not start a yoga business? If you start a yoga business, now your cost
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:01.340]   for your training classes and your retreats now become a deductible business expense instead
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:08.220]   of a personal expense. If you're into music, start a band, record music. Now you can write
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:15.220]   off your band touring and your travel. Do you think the big recording artists pay for
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:20.740]   the cost of all of their travel expenses out of their personal checkbook? Absolutely not.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:27.740]   It comes out of the business checkbook. So think about if you can do the same thing.
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:32.580]   There's no reason why the rules are the same for you and for them. Run your band in a business
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:39.580]   like manner and it'll help you. A piano teacher can deduct the cost of a piano. A performer
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:47.220]   can deduct the cost of getting to their performances. So if you have skills and things like that,
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:54.220]   consider how to leverage your skills and your abilities and leverage the tax code. Can you
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:56:01.900]   find some kind of angle, loophole or exception that you can exploit? Could you get someone
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:06.860]   to pay for your college education by working at the college? Can you work at a job that'll
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:12.940]   reimburse you for college expenses or work at the school where you're studying? That's
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:18.100]   super valuable. Can you work at your kid's school instead of paying the tuition straight
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:25.100]   up or have your spouse work at your kid's school? Could you play the system? This example
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:30.940]   is not going to apply to everybody, but if you have kids that are going to college, let's
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:37.220]   say that you have some money. One aspect of the college financial aid system right now
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:42.220]   is based upon your income. So there's a form that's called a FAFSA, a free application
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:49.220]   for federal student aid. That's a need-based number that the government says, "Disclose
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:54.820]   to us your financial situation and we'll let you know how much money we think you should
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:57:00.700]   be able to contribute towards your kid's college." Well, if you're planning on taking some time
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:05.340]   off, why not take a couple of years off, a year or two off? Take a little mini-retirement,
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:10.420]   travel with your kids, do some work on a personal project, drop your income down to extremely
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:17.420]   low level. You'll qualify your kids to qualify for more financial aid based upon higher financial
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:21.540]   need. I've never done this, don't know all the rules on it, but it seems like it could
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:28.540]   be an option. Look into any kind of student loan forgiveness program or mortgage indebtedness
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:32.700]   forgiveness program. The HARP program that came out, I think it was HARP 2 that was actually
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:39.700]   somewhat effective where you can write off some balance of the money that you owe. Look
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:45.460]   into those types of programs. Maybe there's some kind of pricing anomaly. Right now, as
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:50.220]   I record this in July of 2013, I've been hearing about all these great lease deals that you
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:55.260]   can get on certain cars, especially electric cars. My understanding is that you can lease
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:58:02.260]   a Nissan LEAF right now for about $200 a month. $200 a month total lease cost. That's pretty
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:08.100]   substantial if you're commuting costs and you switch some of your gas costs over to
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:13.020]   electric costs. That's a subsidized cost. Sometimes companies will want to get their
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:19.900]   products out there so they'll basically develop these programs and they're subsidizing the
[01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:26.900]   cost of you getting the value. They're subsidizing it so that their products get out there and
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:36.300]   you get the deal. Finally, look for a way to stack all these ideas and stack these functions
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:43.100]   together. I love the concept of stacking functions. It's a permaculture concept. Basically, try
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:50.100]   to figure out how many things you can do with one decision. Multi-purpose would be better
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:56.860]   than single-purpose. Figure out how to combine multiple functions in one thing. Examples
[01:58:56.860 --> 01:59:01.540]   I came up with, these were just off the top of my head. I don't know if these things are
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:06.820]   applicable. You can figure it out for yourself. Think about how you can combine these ideas.
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:12.860]   For example, could you join the Mercedes-Benz Owner's Club or figure out a way to get into
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:18.240]   that club that would allow you to get a discount on the car? Could you negotiate the price
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:25.040]   of that car aggressively with various dealers and with the factory based upon the region
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:28.900]   that you're shopping in and shopping on the internet and shopping on a telephone? Could
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:35.700]   you buy the car in Europe and pick it up at the European factory system so that you're
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:41.000]   going to drive it across Europe? Do you have a reason to be in Europe on business anyway
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:47.740]   so you can buy the cost of the ticket to get there through your business, which turns some
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:53.460]   portion of your trip expenses into a deductible expense? You pick up the car in Europe and
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:58.620]   travel across Europe on your European vacation driving your own car. Could you buy those
[01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:03.340]   tickets through a business credit card and then later have the miles available to you
[02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:10.820]   in your account? Could you get a discount on that airline ticket by doing online research
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:18.620]   for what the best airline deal is right now? Could you go at a time when the price is substantially
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:23.460]   depressed because you're going on the shoulder season? Now you have your own car to drive
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:26.880]   throughout Europe, so because you have your own car you can travel to the places that
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:30.820]   are difficult for all the tourists to get with public transportation, which means you
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:33.700]   may get better deals and have a good time and then when you're ready you drop the car
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:39.940]   off at the port and fly home. So I don't know if that's possible or not, I've never done
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:43.500]   it, probably won't ever do it, but think about things like that because is there a way that
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:48.260]   you could stack all those functions together? Could you, you need a college education, so
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:54.460]   could you get a job at the university where you are interested in going to school and
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:58.980]   because you're getting a job there the university will fund your tuition and they will pay for
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:02.820]   the cost of your tuition. So instead of you having to come up with money you are being
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:09.700]   paid for work. Could you live at the university where you have lower expenses because you're
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:15.260]   living in university housing, you have discounted tuition, because you have university housing
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:19.540]   and you're next to your job and your classes you don't need an expensive car to drive while
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:23.860]   you're there so you have lower ongoing costs, you have more time freedom because you're
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:30.980]   in an academic environment and you're studying for academics and you have low income tax
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:35.100]   rates which allow you to save a substantial portion of your money. And then could you
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:40.860]   take advantage of any university study abroad programs or swapping deals they have where
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:47.100]   you could go and either be a student or be an employee at a study abroad system and work
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:52.900]   living in another country for an experience but still working somehow in your prior country
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:02:00.980]   of residence where perhaps the wages are higher. I don't know but I'm sure someone has put
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:09.260]   together some really interesting functions like that. If you need an appliance for your
[02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:17.060]   house can you find a very energy efficient washing machine and can you buy it used from
[02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:21.620]   the scratch and dent store and can you use either negotiate a cash discount or can you
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:27.140]   use a rewards credit card where you have an additional protection from the rewards credit
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:34.780]   card and can you pay for it from a local dealer who is making their income in the local economy.
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:40.340]   Look for ways to find these types of ways and stack all these functions together. So
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:46.180]   that's my list. I guarantee that there are a few hundred more ideas that you may have
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:50.100]   and that you can come up with. Put the ideas in the show notes. Today's episode, episode
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:56.300]   five, go to Radical Personal Finance and look for episode five. So put these ideas in the
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:03.340]   show notes and see what you can come up with. Most of all look for efficiency. Think about
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:08.380]   eliminating an expense completely. Think about optimizing an expense if it's something that
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:13.580]   you decide is worth it based upon your goals. Again, I wouldn't expect that these ideas,
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:16.260]   hardly any of them probably will apply to your life. There may be things that apply
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:22.380]   to my life. But I think that the way of thinking about it can be extremely valuable for you.
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:28.700]   There are ideas in here which you can use. You can find these loopholes in your own planning
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:34.540]   and you'll be able to use these ideas in here for your own situation if you look for
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:40.780]   it. These ideas are scalable. Let them mate with each other in your head and think about
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:45.580]   with the decisions that you have to make, think about how you can stack the functions
